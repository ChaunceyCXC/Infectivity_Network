1,that's funny. No. I let him roam around the house.
1,Can't believe he grew up so quick
1,"Yeah, kids grow up so quickly "
1,What do you usually do when he visits?
1,"We will probably just spend most of the time here at home, no big plans really."
1,What does your turtle eat?  Is it hard to take care of a turtle?
1,I understand. I think we will do the same. I hope he brings a few of his friends. I am not that old... if you know what I mean :)
1,"He eats insects, leaves and sun flower seeds. It's easy. They don't need walking and cleanup is simple. Do you have any pets?"
1,"No, not at the moment.  I have 3 girls and they are enough trouble! LOL"
1,You're only as old as you feel is what I say.
1,"Yes, that's exactly right! If you don't mind me asking, have you ever considered any of your son's friends? ^_^"
1,"Not really since I am usually spending my time alone in my studio painting, but I might give it some thought."
1,Congratulations. Do you come from a big family?
1,"You should. I am not really a blond, but I would say cute and the kids dig me. :) And you know, sometimes I let them play with me"
1,"Well everyone is an adult so who am I to judge, sounds like a good bit of fun to me."
1,"I don't, just 2 siblings.  But my wife wanted a lot of kids. So, there you go."
1,"What are you up to now, girl?"
1,Just about to clean up my paints and and put them away for the day.
1,Wow. cool. How often do you use computers?

2,"Yeah, kids grow up so quickly "
2,"Wow, you've done a marathon?  I run a bit, but never tried anything long"
2,What do you usually do when he visits?
2,Yeah it's a great way to keep your heart healthy! I wish the marathons were in the evening though. Are you a morning or night person?
2,I'm totally a morning person.  I wake naturally around 6 a.m. And you?
2,"I wake up at 6 a.m.when I have work, sometimes I'll get up at 5 a.m. though for a morning run."
2,"We will probably just spend most of the time here at home, no big plans really."
2,"So, how long and how far is your morning run?  And when you prepare for a marathon?"
2,"Generally I'll run about 3 miles, but when a marathon is coming up I'll build my way up to 5 or 7 miles every morning."
2,I understand. I think we will do the same. I hope he brings a few of his friends. I am not that old... if you know what I mean :)
2,That's impressive.  I would like to try but I just don't have the stamina! Do you ever run with a dog?
2,You're only as old as you feel is what I say.
2,"Yes, that's exactly right! If you don't mind me asking, have you ever considered any of your son's friends? ^_^"
2,"I don't have a dog, I just don't have the time to dedicate to a pet! Do you have any pets?"
3,Canning is great for storing food. Sometimes I can food before my marathons to calm my anxiety.
3,How would I start rock climbing?
3,I would suggest a fitness place with a rock wall.  Try that out in a safe environment
3,I will do that. I will take my mom with me since she is my best friend.
3,"It's good to have a spotter! Also, get in overall good shape with an emphasis on balance"
3,"Wow, you've done a marathon?  I run a bit, but never tried anything long"
3,Where should be go after the fitnes place? Would the ocean be a good spot?
3,Ha ha - not for rock climbing.  Maybe you are thinking of diving?
3,Yeah it's a great way to keep your heart healthy! I wish the marathons were in the evening though. Are you a morning or night person?
3,I was thinking about diving. I would love to see some real life mermaids.
3,You may need to limit yourself to Disneyland for mermaids.  They're not actually real.

3,"I don't have a dog, I just don't have the time to dedicate to a pet! Do you have any pets?"
3,I see.  I wonder where she has seen them?
3,"No pets, just a crowd of feral cats from the neighborhood that roam through the yard. Fun to watch."
4,How would I start rock climbing?
4,I am excited. I just hope they can get through today then the rest of the week will be easy.
4,I would suggest a fitness place with a rock wall.  Try that out in a safe environment

4,Thats not true. My mother told me they really exist.
4,The morgue! ROFL
4,I see.  I wonder where she has seen them?
4,"haaa, a museum."
4,She saw them when she was younger. I will believe my best friend since I know my mother well.
4,Far be it to argue with anyone's mother!  Do you have siblings?
4,"That was my second guess :) but it was too late, I pressed the Send button"
5,I am excited. I just hope they can get through today then the rest of the week will be easy.
5,It's really great to have the memories.

6,"Thats cool, most shades of green are named after plants."
6,What do your kids look back at the pictures you kept of theme over the years

6,"Pets are part of the family like humans, what typ of pets do you have if any"

6,Have you ever visited any other cities? I may go on a trip this winter.
6,"I have been to many cities around the world, try to avoid cities that have rainy seasons or get too cold in winter"
6,right. the rain can ruin a whole day if trying to explore a city.
6,"Yes some cities, get flooded like Venice in winter or get too cold like northern ctiies in Europe, America and Canada"
6,"I have 2 dogs, oreo and cupcake, they are goldendoodles"

17,it is harder some days than others. but it is good you get along with your mom so well
17,Haha I wish! My ex texted me the other day. She apparently still loves me.

17,We wanted different things in the future. She wanted kids and I didn't. Stuff like that.
17,Do you think either of you have changed your minds on that stuff?
17,"it was good, this happened in my adult life so we all had work and stuff and maybe did not socialize as often as we could have"

28,"No, It was fairly easy learning how to play, however I did have to practice a lot."
28,"Did you decide to learn it on your own, or did you get lessons?"

28,Do you have kids of  your own?

29,Are they still children or are they grown?
29,"They are my wife's children from her previous marriage. The eldest is disabled, and my wife cares for him. The younger is in high school."
29,Yeah. Do you ever use the blue light filter feature on your devices?

36,Yes. She was a 4th grade teacher that loved art and cooking! She made the best meatloaf ever!
36,How awesome! My father loved to cook for my family as well when he was home from deployment.
36,What is your favorite thing he made for you?

36,He made the absolute best chicken parmesan! 
36,Do you know what kind of cheese they used? Like usually we use cheddar now.
36,Ohh I love me some chicken parme Reminds me of that Peyton Manning commercial!

37,"I don't consider her a rapper, she's an okay rapper for a singer."
37,Why isn't she a rapper?
37,I work 60 hours a week so it's hard to find time to do the montessori lifestyle

38,That is a really good way of looking at it. And you can share those memories with new people in your life and breathe life into them.
38,You are so right. It can make all the difference.
38,Why isn't she a rapper?
38,Do you have other family members to help you after your loss?

41,authentic american cuisine.. we're pretty much going for the bar and wine selection
41,there is a course for anything isnt there
41,Do they ever have a wine tasting?
41,Honestly yes. You didn't take a recommended speech course in college? I swear it was mandatory
41,"not sure , there may be many during the week. seeing that they're new in town "
41,Sounds like something my wife would drag me to.
41,i didnt take it that seriously. honestly hate speeches
42,anything i do i try to do great at it. i'd say i gave it my best. i was satisfied 
42,It's amazing how a little kindness from strangers can go such a long way.
42,"I understand, but at least you were prepared and you feel accomplished."
42,"He thought I was cute and old fashioned since I wore a locket. I still love to line dry my clothes! Nothing better, I say!"
42,I agree with you! The way linens smell after being air dried is way better than any dryer sheet
42,"A word of advice, always hang your clothes higher than your goats can reach! I learned that early on living on a homestead! Explains the missing socks!"
42,you dont get nervous to speak infront of crowds?
42,"Extremely nervous, actually. But I haven't had that big of an issue since my speech course in college. Lucky for me I passed."
42,Oh wow yeah! I never thought about that. I don't raise animals but my neighbor does. I do like to hunt deer from time to time.
42,there is a course for anything isnt there
42,"We've had so many animals but their all for slaughter or use on the farm, chickens for eggs, goats for milk, ya know.... we hunt a lot as well."
42,Honestly yes. You didn't take a recommended speech course in college? I swear it was mandatory
42,i didnt take it that seriously. honestly hate speeches
42,"I get that. Even though it was mandatory, I'm glad I took it since I obviously needed it due to me running for political office back in 2004"
42,"That's great. I love animals, but I also love the thrill of the hunt. I use a bow to make it more interesting."
43,It's amazing how a little kindness from strangers can go such a long way.

50,I want to innovate for future generations.
50,"No, I own a small business. I can only afford to pay my workers minimum wage, but I treat them well. I have heard stories about horrible working conditions."

51,We have watched every show on there I think!
51,I agree. Currently at my workplace we have a team working on reducing emissions. Are you currently working anywhere?
52,Netflix original shows are the best in my opinon

52,Im not a big fan of heights myselg!
52,"My sister is the opposite of you. She has a passion for heights - she could dance along a cliff edge, it wouldn't bother her a bit."
52,Wow that sounds awful to me! I would much rather be in a casino lol
52,Wow! That is wonderful! They will get so much use out of Netflix. The selection for kids is terrific.

53,I am 22. I also love science
53,"I have trouble remembering, I just think about how they taste"
53,"I love eating barbeque sandwiches. We served them at my birthday party, along with pizza puffs. I love science too, but not as much as pizza puffs."
53,I am a scientist for a living
53,"Yeah, it's hard remembering anything if you're like myself, working the same job for 8 whole years. "
53,i am 19 and still in school. Scientist sounds interesting!
53,It is the best. That and the beatles haha!
53,Oh wow that't a long time to be in one job! What do you do?
53,oh yes the beatles are the best of the best. but are they better than barbeque sandwiches? 
53,"I work in marketing. It's kinda cut throat sometimes. When I get home, I put some rolling stones on and it all melts away."
53,Oh yeah
53,too bad the beatles are not around anymore. Sometimes I like to imagine John Lennon is right here with me.
53,He is in spirit
53,Mmm what a way to relax!
53,"Yes, he was the best musician ever."
53,It certainly does put me in a good emotional state. They're my favorite band after all.
53,"Cool, I prefer opera myself, there's just something about it that soothes me"
53,They all were great
54,"I have trouble remembering, I just think about how they taste"
54,Thanks for your support! Hopefully I will make it as an actor!
54,"Yeah, it's hard remembering anything if you're like myself, working the same job for 8 whole years. "
54,"You're welcome. Well, an actor in the background is still a very important actor. Maybe you'll be in a lead role someday!"
54,"Thanks, you're right! How about you? What do you want to do?"
54,Make more money! It totally blows working at scrubway. 
54,Oh wow that't a long time to be in one job! What do you do?
54,"I work in marketing. It's kinda cut throat sometimes. When I get home, I put some rolling stones on and it all melts away."
54,I can imagine. What do you think you would be good at?
54,Mmm what a way to relax!
54,It certainly does put me in a good emotional state. They're my favorite band after all.
54,"Not too sure, but I never want to disappoint my family. That's why I'm in college for engineering."
54,"Cool, I prefer opera myself, there's just something about it that soothes me"
54,"Nice, well engineering can definitely get you a high paying job"
54,"Honestly, opera can be so cool."
54,"It totally can. Anyway enough about me, you got any cool hobbies?"
54,"I'm glad you think so, most people just don't appreciate it at all"
54,"Theatre pretty much consumes my life at the moment, but I love it"
54,Most people don't appreciate anything worthwhile.
55,Thanks for your support! Hopefully I will make it as an actor!
55,"Nah, we never could afford the fancy things. Best I had was out of a can!"
55,"You're welcome. Well, an actor in the background is still a very important actor. Maybe you'll be in a lead role someday!"
55,"Thanks, you're right! How about you? What do you want to do?"
55,"Well, you get experience points on that. Hopefully, the next dish is better."
55,Make more money! It totally blows working at scrubway. 
55,I can imagine. What do you think you would be good at?
55,"Not too sure, but I never want to disappoint my family. That's why I'm in college for engineering."
55,"Nice, well engineering can definitely get you a high paying job"
55,"It totally can. Anyway enough about me, you got any cool hobbies?"
55,"Theatre pretty much consumes my life at the moment, but I love it"
55,I'm sure it would be if I could find a way to heat it up! Usually that makes it better.
55,Any favorite actors?
55,"You ate the dish cold?! That sounds vile, it really needs to be hot."
55,Yeah I did. But I was on my boat fishing at the time. I was in the middle of the lake and got hungry. That can was all I had.
55,I suppose if you're starving you wouldn't really care if its hot or cold. Why didn't you eat one of the fish that you caught?
55,Can I say myself? Haha
55,Hadn't caught any yet. Plus they are hard to cook on a little boat. Do you eat raw fish?
55,Of course! But who is #2?
56,"Nah, we never could afford the fancy things. Best I had was out of a can!"
56,I gave the cash I had to a homeless guy by the art gallery.
56,is he still there maybe? hope so. Remember the movie Groundhog Day. It was the homeless guys last day
56,I don't watch much TV. I spend most days painting. 
56,"TV is good to fall asleep to, i've wanted to start painting but being a nurse keeps me busy"
56,"Well, you get experience points on that. Hopefully, the next dish is better."
56,I'm sure it would be if I could find a way to heat it up! Usually that makes it better.
56,"You ate the dish cold?! That sounds vile, it really needs to be hot."
56,Yeah I did. But I was on my boat fishing at the time. I was in the middle of the lake and got hungry. That can was all I had.
56,I suppose if you're starving you wouldn't really care if its hot or cold. Why didn't you eat one of the fish that you caught?
56,Hadn't caught any yet. Plus they are hard to cook on a little boat. Do you eat raw fish?
56,"How do you handle being a nurse, working with so many people? I get so nervous around people."
56,I like being busy and helping people is fun.
56,I guess I'll always be a shy person. I doubt that my date calls me back. I think you were right.
56,"Yes I suppose it would be hard to cook. I've had sushi which is raw, is it not?"
57,I do
57,"Awesome! I was so close to there when I was hiking one day, but I had to return home for it was getting dark."
57,"Haha, I don't like walking in the dark either."
57,"That's excellent, what's your favorite, I have tons of favorites."
57,Probably Nike tennis shoes.
57,"I love nike designs, their footwear is some of the most comfortable and stylish stuff I've ever worn."
57,"Indeed, speaking of dark, what type of chocolate do you prefer most? I prefer vegan 100 percent cocoa."
57,I like Almond milk chocolate.  I'm glad chocolate has health benefits as well.
57,"Me too! It contains so many antibiotics, no wonder it was used in medicine many years ago, and today as well."
57,Indeed it is. The children at the school I teach at always love to see my new shoes.
57,"Chocolate is not just good for the body, but for the soul as well."
57,"That's good. Speaking of good, do you like discovering new restaurants to eat at? "
57,"Very true, the ancients used it very often as a treat. Also, I think I meant antioxidants, not antibiotics... "
57,no worries; I knew what you meant.
57,Thanks! I'm glad there's someone whom understands chocolate and me!
57,mhm. I always try out a new restraunt once a month after work.
57,"Since you like it so much, you should visit Chocolate World if you get the chance. There are shops and restaurants there too."
57,I enjoy dining out as well . what is your favorite restaurant so far?
57,El Chico is my favorite restraunt.
57,"Cool, thanks! Perhaps I could hike there someday soon during the spring time."
57,I love eating there as well. The food is always amazing and always up to quality.
58,"Awesome! I was so close to there when I was hiking one day, but I had to return home for it was getting dark."
58,They're 6 and 9
58,"Haha, I don't like walking in the dark either."

58,A boy and a girl. Thomas and Abigale.
58,I like Almond milk chocolate.  I'm glad chocolate has health benefits as well.
58,"Me too! It contains so many antibiotics, no wonder it was used in medicine many years ago, and today as well."
58,"Chocolate is not just good for the body, but for the soul as well."
58,"Very true, the ancients used it very often as a treat. Also, I think I meant antioxidants, not antibiotics... "
58,no worries; I knew what you meant.
58,oh that's adorable. Are they well behaved?
58,They are most of the time; Thomas always seems to get into trouble when he comes with me to feed the horses.
58,Thanks! I'm glad there's someone whom understands chocolate and me!
59,They're 6 and 9
59,"Indeed, but more nervous. Ironic for I teach yoga..."
59,"Hey, I bet that's an interesting job. I actually have never done yoga! I keeping meaning to, but sometimes I hear voices telling me that it's a bad idea!"
59,"Thanks, I teach yoga on weekdays, I work at the red cross other days. I hope this date day goes well."
59,I've got my fingers crossed for you! Where are you going?
59,"Thanks, I'm going to the gym where I used to do yoga a few times a week. I turned it into a living by recording my yoga and teaching."
59,Sounds awesome! We have a fitness center locally that offers tanning beds and massages.  i was thinking of joining just for that.
59,That is so neat. Are they at the age that they like the Australian Band Hi-5? My kids love to binge watch their show!

59,Yes I am looking forward to the meeting too! What are you going to wear to your date?!
60,That's cool! What was the heaviest weight you lifted?
60,Do they have a car show associated with it? I like looking at suped up toyota cars.
60,"My max is 180 lbs, but different days I target different muscle groups with different exercises."
60,"i only like toyota vehicles. I have a corolla and they drive amazingly,"
60,"Excellent, thank's for letting me know. I remember taking protein supplements back in the day, they were sorta good. Do you take any?  "
60,I had a corolla for several years too. I want to get a Tacoma pickup soon.
60,"Yes, I enjoy the peanut butter protein powder a few times a week.  I also like to eat clean and meal prep. Do you meal prep?"
60,Cool. I enjoy cocoa and milk as a source of protein. I used to meal prep often before going to class. 
60,its almost the hollidays. You're combination reminds me of hot chocolate. I just drink the protein shake before working out. What did you study?
60,Nice - They are very fun to drive. I love these music festivals though. Love the food too!
60,What kind of food do they have there?
60,Pretty much food you would find at a fair. All things fried...including cheese. I LOVE cheese.

60,oh yes! Cheese is one of my favorite foods!
60,i love queso too.
60,That's awesome. I was terribel at math.

60,That is a while. Do you work now?
61,Do they have a car show associated with it? I like looking at suped up toyota cars.

61,I enjoy museims too. They remind me of my mother who died when I was young.
61,I bet that was hard. Do you still struggle with that loss?
61,Do you like fried cheese? That is one of my favorites.
61,I do stuggle. Her favorite color was blue so that is now my favorite as well. 
61,oh yes! Cheese is one of my favorite foods!
62,"Yes, I defaulted on my son's car payment. "
62,That is so cool. Was the work difficult?
62,"No, it was just boring painting the sides of dice all day."
62,"Oh, no, that's terrible. Do you have any loans that are in danger of going into foreclosure if you stop making payments?"
62,I may lose my house unfortunately. However my husband works in the government and he can help.
62,That does so sound boring. I would work during the night shifts.
62,I'm really sorry to hear that. I hope everything works out.
62,Thanks. Do you have any children?
62,"No, I have no children and am single , but I hope some day to have some."
62,What factory do you work in?
62,I should never have taken out the loan for my son's car. He can't afford to pay it and neither can I. But I still love him. 
62,We make showers and sinks. I sleep all day after my shift.
62,"Well, bad things happen to everybody. You just have to learn from your mistakes and look towards the future."
62,Thank you for being sympathetic. I will go back into the workforce and pay it down.
62,That sounds like hard work. I am trying to make it as a magician in Las Vegas.
62,That sounds like a good decision. I wish the best of luck to you and your son!

62,That sounds like a magical career. I would not fall asleep watching that!
63,That is so cool. Was the work difficult?
63,You sound very mature for your age.
63,"No, it was just boring painting the sides of dice all day."
63,That does so sound boring. I would work during the night shifts.
63,What factory do you work in?

63,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you spend much time with your family then?"
63,That sounds like a magical career. I would not fall asleep watching that!
63,I do but my dad is super strict so I keep to myself or spend time with my mom. They say that I'm gifted. 
63,Magic is my life. I can read minds!
63,"Okay, what am I thinking now?"
63,I sense....a presence. Have you recently lost a loved one? They are trying to contact you.
63,"Well, genius is two parts discipline and one part natural ability so you'll probably appreciate your dad's perspective when you're as old as I am"
63,Thats correct! You'll have no problem making it in Las Vegas.
63,I am just worried about getting into a great college and getting far away from here
63,What worries you about it? Do you think you'll make friends easier in college?

64,Yes I don't have many friends because I am congnitively ahead of my peers
64,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you spend much time with your family then?"
64,Thats not right. I think you should find better things to do.
64,Well I am very bothered by the voices I hear in my head. They told me to.
64,I have problems too. I am really afraid of heights. 
64,I do but my dad is super strict so I keep to myself or spend time with my mom. They say that I'm gifted. 
64,So is the neighborhood pool boy! It is so hard having that problem.
64,"Well, genius is two parts discipline and one part natural ability so you'll probably appreciate your dad's perspective when you're as old as I am"
64,People tell me that my belief in mermaids being real is a problem.

114,A caregiver is someone who takes care of people who cannot ordinarily take care of themselves.
114,I did a little bit of that when I was in college.  I took care of a few autistic adults.  It was emotional.
114,"That must have been an interesting experience. I've read about adults with autism, it sounds quite difficult. What did you learn from the experience?"
114,I like to read too. I do it everyday. /enjoy it while traveling even more.
114,Where do you like to travel?
114,Everywhere. I love to teach people from other cultures and help them improve their lives.
114,One thing was how big their personalities could be.  My guy was hilarious.  He told great jokes!
114,Fascinating. I tend to travel close to home because I only travel by train. Where are you traveling to next?

115,you mean older ppl (like me) or those younger than you
115,in general people younger than me but I'm almost 40 so it's a different world than the one I grew up in
115,Yes I see what you mean.  There are alot of nuances to communication texting and PC communication has added.
115,"That sounds like a cool job. I dropped out of high school, and a few years later started a small business with my dad."

117,I can't wait for the Washington Nationals parade to celebrate their World Series win.
117,I agree! Math is way too hard. If you need help you can always ask though!
117,That's true. What are you studying math for?
117,I had to take some math classes to finish my nursing degree. I only took them because they were mandatory though. Why are you studying math?
117,I'm hoping to go into engineering. So I better improve my math! Don't want to be serving tables forever.
117,I am also eagerly waiting for the moment
117,You can do it! I'm more of an athlete. I have travelled lots for competitions which was great. Have you travelled anywhere?
117,"Last year, I went to Belarus. It was really interesting, the country is almost lost in time. Have you ever been to Eastern Europe?"
117,That's awesome! I'm truly jealous. I would love to do more travelling but it's so expensive. Did you travel alone or with friends / family? 
117,"I went with a friend from my university. I enjoyed the food, but I definitely missed American cuisine too."
117,What a great series.  I was biting my nails the entire time.  I thought Houston was going to pull it out.
117,That nice .You seems very eager to this.isn't it?
117,That's awesome! I
117,Yeah.  I like having baseball on in the background while I work.  I also love the stats.  Fun!
117,My favourite thing about American food is the french fries - I probably eat too many for my own good!
117,I hope the home team wins.
117,"I cheer for the home team usually, too.  Unless of course, the home team is the Yankees."
117,I live in Canada and we have poutine so that's even worse for you! Have you tried poutine before!?
117,I love the Yankees.

118,I had to take some math classes to finish my nursing degree. I only took them because they were mandatory though. Why are you studying math?
118,Well you should be proud of graduating.  Why didn't you do anything with your degree?
118,I'm hoping to go into engineering. So I better improve my math! Don't want to be serving tables forever.
118,"Because whenever I get an interview they always say ""we decided to move forward with someone else"". It's too much work to keep going to those stupid interviews anyways. "
118,You can do it! I'm more of an athlete. I have travelled lots for competitions which was great. Have you travelled anywhere?
118,Well you will never get in if you don't keep trying?  What are you doing instead?
118,Just watching Shark Tank. They have it so easy. I just have to think of something that'll sell and then I'll never have to work! 
118,"Last year, I went to Belarus. It was really interesting, the country is almost lost in time. Have you ever been to Eastern Europe?"
118,Well that seems like a lot of work and a little risky but I am sure you can think of a good idea
118,That's awesome! I'm truly jealous. I would love to do more travelling but it's so expensive. Did you travel alone or with friends / family? 
118,I know right? It's why I can't think of anything. I wish that I was more imaginative and could think of something. What do you watch? 
118,well I like Naked and afraid but I would never do the show.  I have problems with interviews too when they see my hair
118,"I went with a friend from my university. I enjoyed the food, but I definitely missed American cuisine too."
118,OMG that's so much work. And what's wrong with your hair? I bet you have nicer hair than me though

119,Well that seems like a lot of work and a little risky but I am sure you can think of a good idea
119,I know right? It's why I can't think of anything. I wish that I was more imaginative and could think of something. What do you watch? 
119,"Wow, and how did you end up in Houston?"
119,My boyfriend is in the military and it was this or Fort Worth
119,I see.  Ive never met anyone from Australia here in states.
119,well I like Naked and afraid but I would never do the show.  I have problems with interviews too when they see my hair
119,We have an accent so I'm told but I think people here have the accent :D
120,"A year ago. I'm in Houston, waitressing at a local club since she passed. I'm hoping to move to Australia soon with my BF though."

120,Possibly.  How do you like to prepare your fish?
120,I see.  Ive never met anyone from Australia here in states.
120,"I LOVE salmon. Sear it with some rosemary, lots of butter, and some lemon. to DIE FOR. "
120,We have an accent so I'm told but I think people here have the accent :D
120,That sounds wonderful - what do you like for side dishes?  I eat lots of veggies
120,Some shittake mushrooms and asparagus stirfried with olive oil - I'm a big keto fan so it suits fish 
120,I like the way you think - and EAT!  Sounds very healthy
120,I'm just worried about where I get my fish - sometime i get scared about mercury and other toxins 
120,"Yes, I have that worry too - you can never be sure, can you?"
120,It's why I pay extra for wild salmon and organic stuff - call me a health nut but when I'm 95 who's laughing? LOL 
120,95? That's amazing.  Maybe you should write a book
120,"Yes we definelty speak differently, I love an Aussie accent!!"
121,Not really. Let's talk about food. What do you like to eat? I LOVE fish 
121,I usually watch matches with relatives. It's sort of a family tradition!
121,I like fish too.  But really I am not picky.  Do you eat a lot of fish?
121,"I eat pretty much only fish. My parents do too, and they're both over 6 feet. Probably cause of the fish LOL "
121,That's awesome! Family traditions are the best! Did you do anything for Halloween? It was an excuse to eat chocolate for me.
121,"I bought a lot of candy to hand out, but not many kids showed up! So now I'm stuck with a lot of chocolate, and way too much candy!"
121,Possibly.  How do you like to prepare your fish?
121,"Hey, that sounds like a win to me! More candy for you! What do you like to do for fun?"
121,"I play for my college's basketball team. Between that and my studies, I don't have much free time. What about you?"
121,"I LOVE salmon. Sear it with some rosemary, lots of butter, and some lemon. to DIE FOR. "
121,That sounds fun! I'm pretty busy with studies too but i like to geocache with my boyfriend. What do you study? 
121,"That's really cool. I'm studying education, hoping to become a teacher. What are your career ambitions?"
121,Cool! My boyfriend is in education as well and is on his first placement. I'm in my senior year of psychiatric nursing. Are you enjoying it?
121,That sounds wonderful - what do you like for side dishes?  I eat lots of veggies
121,"Very interesting. I am enjoying it, yes. I'm a bit nervous about entering the job market though. Congrats to your boyfriend! What got you interested in psychiatric nursing?"
121,Some shittake mushrooms and asparagus stirfried with olive oil - I'm a big keto fan so it suits fish 
121,Well we always need new amazing teachers so I'm sure you'll be fine. I was very interested in both nursing and pscyhology and that's psych nursing!
121,Thank you. It sounds like you've found the perfect career fit!
121,I like the way you think - and EAT!  Sounds very healthy
121,I'm just worried about where I get my fish - sometime i get scared about mercury and other toxins

122,That sounds fun! I'm pretty busy with studies too but i like to geocache with my boyfriend. What do you study? 
122,Well working as a librarian can be calming for the most part for sure. Sometimes that quiet time gets annoying though.
122,"That's really cool. I'm studying education, hoping to become a teacher. What are your career ambitions?"
122,I am not used to the quiet! It must be a lot of organizing for you every day.
122,I haven't been working here long so it isn't bad so far. I imagine I'll get tired of the sorting eventually though.
122,"yes! Yin and yang, balance in all things. You'll do great there."
122,Cool! My boyfriend is in education as well and is on his first placement. I'm in my senior year of psychiatric nursing. Are you enjoying it?
122,"I love the learning part. Like just the other day I ran across this book ""Swimming for Dummies"" which was terrific since I don't know how to swim!"
122,"Very interesting. I am enjoying it, yes. I'm a bit nervous about entering the job market though. Congrats to your boyfriend! What got you interested in psychiatric nursing?"

123,"I love the learning part. Like just the other day I ran across this book ""Swimming for Dummies"" which was terrific since I don't know how to swim!"
123,"I love to cook, try to stick to veggies and chicken or fish mostly"
123,i think you might be able to teach yourself but its better to get professionally taught.

138,I see. 10 days sounds good enough!
138,Nope. I've honestly never heard of him. I'm looking him up right now. What else do you like to do for fun?

141,Well as a bank teller you don't scam people
141,"yes, it can be very expensive.  I hope you all have good insurance"
141,right - maybe I should try that! do you need to have experience? 
141,Most teller jobs need experience with handling cash and a high school diploma. so you would have to have some expirience in the field
141,"We do, but still a lot of bills. It is ok, health is important. That's why you need to be active! I used to run fast but I stopped."
141,"Agreed, I have studied ballet all my life to stay activbe"

142,Oh wow good for you! That sounds like a tough course. I'm in psychiatric nursing! I love it!
142,"It's not tough, it's actually pretty easy! It is super boring though. That sounds so interesting woah, I'm jealous. Do you live in the US?"
142,"I ask because I am thinking of serving too, but my hair is long and brown and beautiful. I'd prefer to keep my hair long."
142,No! I live in Canada. Where do you live?
142,I'm in England haha. It's so cold right now and my friends are refusing to turn on the heating in our student house so I'm freezing. How's Canada?
142,Maybe you could ask a recruiter.  Serving my county is one of my greatest joys
142,"Great idea. I know that all are great choices, but what branch of the military would you recommend?"

143,I appreciate all the servicemen and servicewomen that care about our nation as you do. Does the military let you grow long hair?
143,"Yep, I find as I'm getting older that the live music timeframe doesn't work as well...I want to go to bed earlier sometimes"
143,"For sure, sleeping is easier than dealing with other people sometimes"
143,I'm tired easier...and it's harder for me to sleep in. boo hoo. not like when I could easily sleep til 10!

149,I am going to the University of michigan and it is a regular occurence

150,"I also read occasionally, usually to my children. What genre do you like to read?"
150,I like to read romance books. I also like to read to my son as well.
150,"Romance novels are nice, it's a shame real life doesn't usually pan out like a romance novel."
150,"I know, I wish that it would because everyone would be living the good life then. Haha!"
150,Hell yeah. I remember my last Crimson Tide game. I got so drunk I couldn't even recognize my wife my from daughter.
150,"That is true! At least we can read about it in books, that's the second best thing to actually living it."

151,"I know, I wish that it would because everyone would be living the good life then. Haha!"
151,"That is true! At least we can read about it in books, that's the second best thing to actually living it."
151,That is nice. having kids in marriage. It is sad when marriage is broken though. like my parents.
151,My parents got divorced when I was 12. It was very stressful.
151,"it is. I was already old, but I have a 15 year old sister, and yes. It was so hard for her, for me too though."
151,"Yes, I really enjoy to read that genre of books because it really helps me imagine the scenario "
151,I agree. The best thing about summer is that I can read my mystery novels outside in the sun. Do you like mystery books?
151,"I can imagine. It was very hard for me and my brothers, It was very sad to see my dad not live with us anymore."
152,oh no. I don't.
152,No I haven't had the time either. The kids and work take up most of my time!

152,That is nice. having kids in marriage. It is sad when marriage is broken though. like my parents.
152,Yes it would. I wonder if we could take classes online for it? Maybe watch YouTube videos?
152,My parents got divorced when I was 12. It was very stressful.
152,"it is. I was already old, but I have a 15 year old sister, and yes. It was so hard for her, for me too though."
152,That's an awesome suggestion! I have never thought about that before. I might have to google that to see what I can find.
152,I will look into it as well. You can find almost anything is online these days!
152,"I can imagine. It was very hard for me and my brothers, It was very sad to see my dad not live with us anymore."
153,No I haven't had the time either. The kids and work take up most of my time!
153,I know! or basketball...or maybe some other kind of team!
153,"Yup, I guess it depends on what sports your kids like. "
153,Karate would have been interesting to take. I wish I could have made time for it.
153,I wish I could have too. Maybe we will have more time in the future.
153,I hope so. It would be good skills to learn.
153,or maybe they won't like sports at all...you never know! We might end up with an artist!
153,You never know! Hopefully they don't turn out like me... I'm a recovering alcoholic and I was living in a storage locker for two months.
153,Yes it would. I wonder if we could take classes online for it? Maybe watch YouTube videos?
153,That's an awesome suggestion! I have never thought about that before. I might have to google that to see what I can find.
153,I will look into it as well. You can find almost anything is online these days!
153,That's true. I feel like I rely on the internet too much sometimes. Haha!
153,that sounds rough. Are things looking up for you now? Are you going to AA?
153,"As do I, but I don't know if I would have it any other way. Having all that info at your fingertips is amazing!"
153,"Yes, I'm attending AA every Sunday. Luckily I'm in an apartment now too, things are finally starting to go my way."
153,I know.. I pretty much use it in a daily basis for basically everything!! 
153,That's great...I was going to ask about your living situation. It must feel good to be in your own place. 
153,"Me too. I feel like I'm missing a part of myself if I don't have my phone on me. And since I've had kids, it just feels safer having one."
153,"Yes, it's so nice to be able to have somewhere to come relax."
154,I know! or basketball...or maybe some other kind of team!
154,Yes it is quite different but they realy are fast
154,"Yup, I guess it depends on what sports your kids like. "
154,or maybe they won't like sports at all...you never know! We might end up with an artist!
154,"Yes, I have played fast pitch softball...pitching gets really tiring though. I love playing softball and I watch a lot of sports too. "
154,Ya I like to sit down with a bowl of jelly beans a watch a game
154,You never know! Hopefully they don't turn out like me... I'm a recovering alcoholic and I was living in a storage locker for two months.
154,that sounds rough. Are things looking up for you now? Are you going to AA?
154,"Yes, I'm attending AA every Sunday. Luckily I'm in an apartment now too, things are finally starting to go my way."

154,Ya I know it is different but hey come on over and try it out
154,That's great...I was going to ask about your living situation. It must feel good to be in your own place. 
154,"What sports do you play? I know I told you I love softball, I love basketball too"
154,Mostly basketball and volleyball and some tennis
154,"Yes, it's so nice to be able to have somewhere to come relax."
154,I tried skiing too but it wasn't for me. what else do you do for fun? 
154,"oh, I bet! and I'm guessing the heating/ac was not great in the storage locker? How is your job going? "
155,i have 2 dogs
155,It was...I struggled for a long time. Getting better now. Did you have anything similar happen? 
155,"Yeah, but it got better over time"
155,"You know what they say, time heals all wounds. I think that's true, it's just that sometimes it's a LOT of time"
155,"That's so cool! I have a shih tzu and a poodle, What breeds are your dogs?"
155,I have a Chihuaha-Dachshund mix and a husky
155,I agree. some things take longer than others to get over.
155,"Oh, I love huskies! They are very intelligent. Are you thinking about getting any more dogs?"
155,"Yes, I'm trying to look towards the future now. I'm trying meditation and it does help. What will you do for the holidays? "
155,Meditation is cool. I've tried it a few times. I'm not sure yet. Hopefully nothing.
155,I'd love to but I don't know if my boyfriend will let me yet. Are you going to get more?
155,"Probably not, because my husband works in sales and is always away. I would need a lot of help with a new one."
155,I'm planning to spend as much time as possible with my family. Those are the best times for me. /
155,"same here, they can be quite a handful!"
155,How sweet. I am not close to my family. I always enjoy seeing people having good family time.
155,What does your boyfriend do for a living?
156,It was...I struggled for a long time. Getting better now. Did you have anything similar happen? 
156,but what if there is a security issue and I'm off helping someone find a product? that could be a really bad situation.
156,Do they not have enough security staff available so that you can help customers?
156,It's not my job to help customers. I am the only security person.
156,"That is true! I think you're in the right here, clearly. What sort of job would you like to do if this does not work out?"
156,"I honestly love security, I'm a really big guy, 250lbs and really muscular, maybe I'll become a bouncer. "
156,Would you have a day job as well if you became a bouncer or security guard that works at night?
156,"Yeah, but it got better over time"
156,probably just spend more time with my dogs. what do you do?
156,"You know what they say, time heals all wounds. I think that's true, it's just that sometimes it's a LOT of time"
156,"I am currently a student, but I am working towards my dream of becoming a fashion designer."
156,oh that sounds exciting! 
156,Yeah! I would like to create a more affordable stylish brand that looks similar to LV or Gucci.
156,I agree. some things take longer than others to get over.
156,I like that idea. Even though i'ma big guy i really like fashion
156,"Yes, I'm trying to look towards the future now. I'm trying meditation and it does help. What will you do for the holidays? "
156,Meditation is cool. I've tried it a few times. I'm not sure yet. Hopefully nothing.
156,I'm planning to spend as much time as possible with my family. Those are the best times for me. /
156,How sweet. I am not close to my family. I always enjoy seeing people having good family time.
156,I was going to say something earlier but maybe you could be a model for my future stuff! You did say you're big and muscular.
157,but what if there is a security issue and I'm off helping someone find a product? that could be a really bad situation.
157,I think daycares are underrated. They let kids have so much expression and creativity and the employees should be paid more for that.
157,Yes I agree most daycare workers are underpaid it's a very difficult job 
157,Do they not have enough security staff available so that you can help customers?
157,Agreed! Kids require patience that it seems like many of us don't have.
157,It's not my job to help customers. I am the only security person.
157,"That is true! I think you're in the right here, clearly. What sort of job would you like to do if this does not work out?"
157,another thing I think that can be under estmiated is the fact that a lot of kids come from broken homes and have emotional trouble
157,"I honestly love security, I'm a really big guy, 250lbs and really muscular, maybe I'll become a bouncer. "
157,"Exactly! Its heart breaking, and i hope daycares are well aware of that when some kids acta certain way."
157,Would you have a day job as well if you became a bouncer or security guard that works at night?
157,probably just spend more time with my dogs. what do you do?
157,"maybe it would help if they had some type of music program, I always found music relaxing and love all types, do You like music?"
157,Interesting suggestion! I absolutely LOVE music. What genre would you suggest would help?
157,"I am currently a student, but I am working towards my dream of becoming a fashion designer."
158,I think daycares are underrated. They let kids have so much expression and creativity and the employees should be paid more for that.
158,Pushing yourself to do better is always a good idea! Sometimes I honestly feel like I push myself too often.
158,It can be really hard. Nobody should push themselves too hard. It can be stressful.
158,Well when someone focuses on perfectionism they don't really take into account its affects.
158,Yes I agree most daycare workers are underpaid it's a very difficult job 
158,Agreed! Kids require patience that it seems like many of us don't have.
158,I agree. Also very hard on the perfectionist person. Hard for them to accept if they don't make their goals.
158,another thing I think that can be under estmiated is the fact that a lot of kids come from broken homes and have emotional trouble
158,"Exactly! Its heart breaking, and i hope daycares are well aware of that when some kids acta certain way."
158,"Very true, they treat it like it's the end of the world."
158,I agree.  Do you set any goals for yourself?
158,Yes absolutely. Sometimes I believe my goals are too strict or hard to reach.
158,"maybe it would help if they had some type of music program, I always found music relaxing and love all types, do You like music?"
158,Interesting suggestion! I absolutely LOVE music. What genre would you suggest would help?
158,I think every genere can help in some way I would love to teach both a mix of clasical and indie mixed togeter like radiohead mixed with mozart
158,What kind of goals do you set? Like for work or what?
158,I set goals around my work and school. With school I force myself to shoot for the stars and I have to follow every regulation at work.
158,My daughter just graduated top of her class. She knows what that is like. She is a perfectionist too
158,Fair point. I personally haven't indulged in indie music but now you've got me interested!
159,Pushing yourself to do better is always a good idea! Sometimes I honestly feel like I push myself too often.
159,"I do, but not much anymore. Do you?"
159,"I used to have a dirt bike, but don't anymore either. Some of my family ride in groups and events."
159,Why did you stop cycling?
159,It can be really hard. Nobody should push themselves too hard. It can be stressful.
159,Well when someone focuses on perfectionism they don't really take into account its affects.
159,Mountain biking accident. Couldn't afford to replace my bike afterwards.
159,Oh no! That's awful. Did you get hurt in the accident?
159,I agree. Also very hard on the perfectionist person. Hard for them to accept if they don't make their goals.
159, Only my pride was hurt. I have a friend who does some tests to show riding skills and I tried to copy her. It didn't work out so well.
159,"Very true, they treat it like it's the end of the world."
159,Oof! What a bummer. Hopefully your pride has recovered since then. :)
159,"Mostly recovered. I don't think I'll be trying to show off like that again, though!"
159,I don't blame you one bit. Do you have any other hobbies to take its place?
159,I agree.  Do you set any goals for yourself?
159,Yes absolutely. Sometimes I believe my goals are too strict or hard to reach.
159,I take time on the weekends to hike up in Canada. The views up there are great.
159,What kind of goals do you set? Like for work or what?
159,I set goals around my work and school. With school I force myself to shoot for the stars and I have to follow every regulation at work.
159,"Oh wow. I've never been, but I'd like to go one day. Friends who have traveled there absolutely love it."
160,"I do, but not much anymore. Do you?"
160,I wish I could draw tattoos!
160,"It's definitely an art to get good at tattooing, you can't exactly go back and erase a mistake when it's permanent! "
160,I know and that's why you need to find a really good artist to get your tattoo done
160,"I used to have a dirt bike, but don't anymore either. Some of my family ride in groups and events."
160,What would you say is your best way of finding a really good tattoo artist? I am a designer myself but I don't know anyone who tattoos professionally.
160,I have an artist who's been doing tattoos for me for years now
160,Why did you stop cycling?
160,"Cool! I really love how tattooing is becoming more acceptable recently, although I'm not brave enough to get one myself. Does it hurt getting one?"
160,Mountain biking accident. Couldn't afford to replace my bike afterwards.
160,"Yes, little bit but it's worth it!"
160,Have you ever tried designing one yourself? I have been considering it as there seems to be quite a lot of demand for original tattoo designs.
160,You're right! I never tried myself but I thing you should definitelly go for it!
160,Oh no! That's awful. Did you get hurt in the accident?
160,I'd love to but I'd be too worried that someone wouldn't like my design. Can you imagine if someone said they didn't like it after the tattoo was already finished?
160, Only my pride was hurt. I have a friend who does some tests to show riding skills and I tried to copy her. It didn't work out so well.
160,Oof! What a bummer. Hopefully your pride has recovered since then. :)
160,"Mostly recovered. I don't think I'll be trying to show off like that again, though!"
160,that would be hard!
160,I don't blame you one bit. Do you have any other hobbies to take its place?
160,I take time on the weekends to hike up in Canada. The views up there are great.
160,"Luckily I think tattoo removals have become pretty advanced these days, a bad drawing has to be better than getting another persons name tattooed on you though!"
161,I wish I could draw tattoos!
161,Cool that's nice I love dogs and want to get another A dobermin
161,"I love dobermans, they are good dogs. I have to go to work soon. What are you up to tonight?"
161,"It's definitely an art to get good at tattooing, you can't exactly go back and erase a mistake when it's permanent! "
161,I know and that's why you need to find a really good artist to get your tattoo done
161,What would you say is your best way of finding a really good tattoo artist? I am a designer myself but I don't know anyone who tattoos professionally.

161,"Black Mirror is My Fav show on NF I absoulutly love it, My fav ep Fifteen Million Merits have you seen it"
161,"Yes, little bit but it's worth it!"

161,No but i've been dying to check it out.
161,It's great and a cool thing is You can watch in any order as they are all diffrent
161,You're right! I never tried myself but I thing you should definitelly go for it!
161,Awesome. Id love to check it out I saw a clip of one where people had social ratings
161,I'd love to but I'd be too worried that someone wouldn't like my design. Can you imagine if someone said they didn't like it after the tattoo was already finished?
162,Cool that's nice I love dogs and want to get another A dobermin
162,"Well, my mother might be some that believes that... she has 500 pairs of shoes for crying out loud!"
162,Oh wow. What does she say she wants with all those shoes?
162,She just tells me that she can't give them up because he thinks that something awful will happen to me if she does.
162,"Are they her shoes, or did they used to be yours? That seems a little odd!"
162,"I love dobermans, they are good dogs. I have to go to work soon. What are you up to tonight?"
162,I am just relaxing going to make dinner in a little some pork chops have You ate?
162,"No i havent, Im starving lol pork chops sound yummy"

162,"Yep I think I'm going to go to the beach the weekend so that should be relaxing I hope I love to travel, any plans this weekend?"
162,"Huh, interesting. But she thinks something bad will happen to you if she gives up the shoes? Bad like what?"
162,"I'm allergic to a lot of different things like shellfish, cats, etc. So something like I'll get scratched by a cat and die. Who knows!"
162,I am probably gonna stay home this weekend and take it easy. Me and my collie will go get some doggy biscuits
162,Sounds good any upcoming Tv shows you like coming up
162,"Well, I guess moms will mom as they want! Hahaha. Is her house really cluttered with all those shoes?"
162,"No, I have ""left the nest"" as they say. My father and mother both live in the town I grew up in."
162,"Good for you. :) Life happened to me in a pretty rough way, so I'm currently in my folks' basement...but it's a place!"
162,"Yeah, I like stranger things, I've really been wanting to watch Black Mirror. Have you seen it?"
162,Hey at least you have your family close by! What happened if you don't mind me asking?
162,"Black Mirror is My Fav show on NF I absoulutly love it, My fav ep Fifteen Million Merits have you seen it"
163,"Well, my mother might be some that believes that... she has 500 pairs of shoes for crying out loud!"
163,That's so great you can be there for them I have found that having family and friends near can really help

163,What do you mean by controls? and I mainly just have my pets
163,She just tells me that she can't give them up because he thinks that something awful will happen to me if she does.
163,"Are they her shoes, or did they used to be yours? That seems a little odd!"
163,They're shoes that she sees and buys. There are some that used to be mine or my fathers but most are just shoes that she sees at stores.

189,It might not be easy at first but there are many interesting veggie options out there. 
189,What interests me is veggie versions of meat products. I really want to try the impossible whopper.
189,I've never tried that one but it sounds yummy
189,"I've heard good things about it. I love the taste of meat so I am really interested in things like that, would make going vegetarian easier."
189,"Yes I had an amazing time, since they're my favorite band, Best concert ever "
189,For sure. Going vegetarian is so much easier than vegan. I couldn't leave without cheese!
189,"I agree, I would give up if I couldn't have any cheese."
189,Me too! And what do you think about gluten-free diet?
189,"It's good to hear they were good live, that can't be said about every group."
189,"Well, I don't think it's necessary if you don't have a gluten allergy or celiac's disease. I've heard it can lower blood sugar for diabetics though."
189,"Unfortunately, Metallica is great but live they're not that good"
190,"Yes! I LOVE under the bridge, and i also love it when they improvise they make it even better "
190,Parrots are really friendly.
190,They are friendly and cute!

190,Indeed.
190,Most parrots seem to be concentrated in the continents of South America and the islands between Australia and Asia.
190,"I see, it's a personal preference thing I guess"
190,"Yes, but those are the wild ones. The domesticated ones tend to live with humans."
190,"yes indeed, but do the domesticated ones hibernate during winter?"
190,"yes , of course ! have you ever been to a concert ?"
190,"eh, depends on the breed"
190,Really? I personally hibernate in every season haha

190,"Yes I had an amazing time, since they're my favorite band, Best concert ever "
191,Parrots are really friendly.
191,It is a movie that takes place in California. I like it cause I live on the coast like in the movie.

191,"How nice! I am on a see food diet :/, but i always text my mom and apparently they're starting a plant based diet"
191,"Yes, but those are the wild ones. The domesticated ones tend to live with humans."
191,"yes indeed, but do the domesticated ones hibernate during winter?"
191,Switching to a plant based diet could greatly help reduce an individual's carbon footprint.
191,"eh, depends on the breed"
192,It is a movie that takes place in California. I like it cause I live on the coast like in the movie.
192,What is your favorite fruit?

192,"Yes, me too. I haven't met a pie that I didn't like. "
192,That is nice of her. My mom does the same. My grandmother has health issues and switched to a Vegan diet. I went vegan in support of her health.
192,"How nice! I am on a see food diet :/, but i always text my mom and apparently they're starting a plant based diet"
192,"Anything that includes fruit I like, In my mind its healthy even if its pie "
192,Switching to a plant based diet could greatly help reduce an individual's carbon footprint.
192,So true! I have that same mindset. Do you bake your pies?
192,"Yes, since the top producer of CO2 is cow farm and the 6th i think are chicken farms"

193,Music is my everything. I fantasize about having a soundtrack playing to my life. How long have you played violin?
193,"When not studying, I train for marathons. Running really clears my head. What branch of law do you want to work in?"
193,"I have only began learning, so I'm still picking it up. I love music too!"
193,Criminal law. What about you?
193,Criminal Law also. I believe there are too many people incarcerated unjustly due to our societal injustices. Will you defend or prosecute? 
193,My siblings played instruments.They both went to college for free because of their band accomplishments. I prefer to sing. :)
193,What kind of songs do you like to sing?

194,"Haha, Mr.Pickles is not a typical cat, I was given him by a gypsy fortune teller! It's a crazy story"

194,I think he might be the oldest cat in the UK! He's already 35... he's older than my brother! 
194,Wait? Your cat is 35...how is that possible?
194,"I think you might be right, the Mr.Pickles might truly be a possessed demon cat haha"

194,Criminal law. What about you?
194,Criminal Law also. I believe there are too many people incarcerated unjustly due to our societal injustices. Will you defend or prosecute? 
194,"I do, I have two dogs...but they are only 3 and 4 years old and would DEFINITELY not eat pickles."
195,"No clue, I'm still not sure If I'm going to cash it or not. What do you think?"
195,I had it for 4 years. I was given it by my older sister for my birthday. It's a sad day... Do you have any pets?
195,Yeah I have one dog called cody.
195,"Aw, that's cute name for a dog. And how long have you had him?"
195,for three years this winter. We got him for the kids but it turns out I needed him more than them when they left for university haha.
195,I would get in touch with your bank and let them know about it! You don't want to get in any trouble by spending it.
195,"Kids move on very quickly when they go to university, but it's great that Cody can keep you company! After 3 years, he must be like family now"
195,"True, I really need the money though. Do you think I can get in legal trouble?"
195,"He definitly is! He's my baby now, along with the children I teach at school :) What od"
195,You're a teacher? And what do you teach? :) I don't know if I would be able to become a teacher haha
195,"Yeah you probably would do, and that would make your situation worse. I don't think it's worth the risk! Are you working currently?"
195,"Yeah, I think so....one of my sisters ( I have 4) told me to take the risk, Do you have any debt?"
195,"I do yeah, I just got a new job though at an elementary school so I'm moving back to my hometown, so that will help ease the burden."
195,"Oh wow, What grade are you going to be teaching? I teach too."
195,"I teach year two students, so it's not that difficult because they're just learning to count haha. You could! It's not difficult, you just need patience :)"
195,5th grade! Yeah I'm excited. Just moved into an apartment really close to work. What grade do you teach?
196,I had it for 4 years. I was given it by my older sister for my birthday. It's a sad day... Do you have any pets?
196,"Sometimes the best part of Halloween is staying in and watching some horror flicks, that's what I like to do!"
196,Yeah I have one dog called cody.
196,"Aw, that's cute name for a dog. And how long have you had him?"
196,"Horror flicks? Don't you ever get too scared? Haha! I'm not a fan of horrors, much prefer old British comedy tv shows"
196,for three years this winter. We got him for the kids but it turns out I needed him more than them when they left for university haha.
196,"I do, but that's the fun of it! Have you ever seen Only Fools and Horses?"
196,"Kids move on very quickly when they go to university, but it's great that Cody can keep you company! After 3 years, he must be like family now"
196,"But when the movies finish, are you not scared that some of the horror things may happen to you?? Haha! But yes, I love only fools and horses!"
196,"He definitly is! He's my baby now, along with the children I teach at school :) What od"
196,You're a teacher? And what do you teach? :) I don't know if I would be able to become a teacher haha
196,"Nope, I've made it so far in one piece! Who is your favorite character?"
196,"I watched a bit of paranormal activity and I just got too scared, it was too real haha! Rodney was my favourite. Who's your favourite?"
196,"Del Boy! Such a good show, I love the theme music. Do you like music?"
196,"I teach year two students, so it's not that difficult because they're just learning to count haha. You could! It's not difficult, you just need patience :)"
196,"Ahh, year two students definitely don't sound as bad as year 9 haha! But that's the thing, patience is necessary, and it's exhausting!"
196,It is exhausting! But at least I get a lot of holiday time to recover haha! Do you have a job?
196,"Yes, I love music! I used to play guitar and piano when I was younger (used to be pretty good haha). Do you like music?"

197,"I do, but that's the fun of it! Have you ever seen Only Fools and Horses?"
197,"I've got a fear of rodents, I don't like them in general. But why do you think that mice aren't as bad?"
197,"But when the movies finish, are you not scared that some of the horror things may happen to you?? Haha! But yes, I love only fools and horses!"
197,"Nope, I've made it so far in one piece! Who is your favorite character?"
197,They help keep other pests like insects away
197,"Okay, I agree here. To keep the biodiversity, mice are necessary. But keeping them as pets isn't the necessary"
197,"That's true its not, mine are kids to me. We watch Dr.Who together."
197,"I watched a bit of paranormal activity and I just got too scared, it was too real haha! Rodney was my favourite. Who's your favourite?"
197,"You watch Dr.Who with mice? Haha, interesting. And have you read Dr.Who books?"
197,"I can't have books, the mice eat the pages."
197,"That's a shame. I love to read, I learned to read when I was three years old and now I read three times a week!"
197,"Del Boy! Such a good show, I love the theme music. Do you like music?"
197,"Reading is a fun way to take an adventure, before I got my mice I would read. What are your favorite types of books?"
198,Mice aren't as bad as everyone thinks they are.
198,"That's nice, how long have they been married?"
198,"I've got a fear of rodents, I don't like them in general. But why do you think that mice aren't as bad?"
198,"Ten years, my parents will celebrate their fifty anniversary next month. The younger generation could learn from them"
198,"Wow, I hope one day I can be with someone that long. Yes they can to many young marriages end in divorce."
198,They help keep other pests like insects away
198,"Okay, I agree here. To keep the biodiversity, mice are necessary. But keeping them as pets isn't the necessary"
198,"That's true its not, mine are kids to me. We watch Dr.Who together."
198,"I have several children and I will have to teach them life, so that their marriages can last a long time"
198,That is a very good idea. I've yet to be married but hope to teach my children the same thing.
198,"You watch Dr.Who with mice? Haha, interesting. And have you read Dr.Who books?"
198,"I can't have books, the mice eat the pages."
198,"That's a shame. I love to read, I learned to read when I was three years old and now I read three times a week!"
198,"Reading is a fun way to take an adventure, before I got my mice I would read. What are your favorite types of books?"

198,"I love reading academic books and books about history! Books about Chinese, Russian and French history are fascinating!"
198,I won't my boyfriend and I want to be in a more stable enviroment and financially be able to do so before we go there.
199,"That's nice, how long have they been married?"
199,"Wow, I didn't know that. I think Bacon should be it's own food group."
199,"Ten years, my parents will celebrate their fifty anniversary next month. The younger generation could learn from them"
199,"Wow, I hope one day I can be with someone that long. Yes they can to many young marriages end in divorce."
199,"I have several children and I will have to teach them life, so that their marriages can last a long time"
199,That is a very good idea. I've yet to be married but hope to teach my children the same thing.
199,"Bacon should be, and if you think about it, it's meat candy. It's so versatile as well. "
199,"I've never thought of it like that but it is. My favorite is using bacon with veggies, makes them taste better."
199,"Agreed, bacon with green beans is a great side dish."
199,I like to wrap it around asparagus topped with cheese.
199,"If you're not married yet, don't rush into marriage. It's an important life event!"
199,Now that sounds really good! I may have to try that some time. Have you ever used bacon mixed with ground beef for a burger?
199,I won't my boyfriend and I want to be in a more stable enviroment and financially be able to do so before we go there.
199,Yes I have I add peppers into the mix as well to give it a kick.
199,"Good trick, what type of bacon do you normally use? I prefer peppered bacon or thick cut."
199,"That is the best approach to take, slow and steady! Especially today, financial stability is key"
199,I like applewood smoked.
199,Yes it is always better to be financially stable before than to just jump in without swimmies on so to speak.
199,"That's a good type too, perfect on a BLT"
200,"Wow, I didn't know that. I think Bacon should be it's own food group."
200,my sister also doing that

200,i am a single
200,I like to wrap it around asparagus topped with cheese.
200,Are you happy in life?
200,Now that sounds really good! I may have to try that some time. Have you ever used bacon mixed with ground beef for a burger?

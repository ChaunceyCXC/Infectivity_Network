1,that's funny. No. I let him roam around the house.
1,Can't believe he grew up so quick
1,"Yeah, kids grow up so quickly "
1,What do you usually do when he visits?
1,"We will probably just spend most of the time here at home, no big plans really."
1,I understand. I think we will do the same. I hope he brings a few of his friends. I am not that old... if you know what I mean :)
1,You're only as old as you feel is what I say.
1,What does your turtle eat?  Is it hard to take care of a turtle?
1,"He eats insects, leaves and sun flower seeds. It's easy. They don't need walking and cleanup is simple. Do you have any pets?"
1,"No, not at the moment.  I have 3 girls and they are enough trouble! LOL"
1,"Yes, that's exactly right! If you don't mind me asking, have you ever considered any of your son's friends? ^_^"
1,Congratulations. Do you come from a big family?
1,"I don't, just 2 siblings.  But my wife wanted a lot of kids. So, there you go."
1,Wow. cool. How often do you use computers?
1,I use a Mac for my work - I'm a music teacher.  I find it really helpful.  How about you?  Are you on the computer a lot?
1,"Not really since I am usually spending my time alone in my studio painting, but I might give it some thought."
1,Often. I use them at work for editing. I head about a way to stream videos or movies from the local library.
1,"Stream from the library - now, that sounds interesting. My wife and I do some scuba diving and want to begin filming underwater. Ever tried that?"
1,"You should. I am not really a blond, but I would say cute and the kids dig me. :) And you know, sometimes I let them play with me"
2,Can't believe he grew up so quick
2,Canning is great for storing food. Sometimes I can food before my marathons to calm my anxiety.
2,"Yeah, kids grow up so quickly "
2,"Wow, you've done a marathon?  I run a bit, but never tried anything long"
2,Yeah it's a great way to keep your heart healthy! I wish the marathons were in the evening though. Are you a morning or night person?
2,What do you usually do when he visits?
2,"We will probably just spend most of the time here at home, no big plans really."
2,I'm totally a morning person.  I wake naturally around 6 a.m. And you?
2,I understand. I think we will do the same. I hope he brings a few of his friends. I am not that old... if you know what I mean :)
2,You're only as old as you feel is what I say.
2,"I wake up at 6 a.m.when I have work, sometimes I'll get up at 5 a.m. though for a morning run."
2,"Yes, that's exactly right! If you don't mind me asking, have you ever considered any of your son's friends? ^_^"
2,"Not really since I am usually spending my time alone in my studio painting, but I might give it some thought."
2,"So, how long and how far is your morning run?  And when you prepare for a marathon?"
2,"You should. I am not really a blond, but I would say cute and the kids dig me. :) And you know, sometimes I let them play with me"
2,"Well everyone is an adult so who am I to judge, sounds like a good bit of fun to me."
2,"What are you up to now, girl?"
2,"Generally I'll run about 3 miles, but when a marathon is coming up I'll build my way up to 5 or 7 miles every morning."
3,Canning is great for storing food. Sometimes I can food before my marathons to calm my anxiety.
3,How would I start rock climbing?
3,"Wow, you've done a marathon?  I run a bit, but never tried anything long"
3,I would suggest a fitness place with a rock wall.  Try that out in a safe environment
3,Yeah it's a great way to keep your heart healthy! I wish the marathons were in the evening though. Are you a morning or night person?
3,I'm totally a morning person.  I wake naturally around 6 a.m. And you?
3,"I wake up at 6 a.m.when I have work, sometimes I'll get up at 5 a.m. though for a morning run."
3,"So, how long and how far is your morning run?  And when you prepare for a marathon?"
3,I will do that. I will take my mom with me since she is my best friend.
3,"Generally I'll run about 3 miles, but when a marathon is coming up I'll build my way up to 5 or 7 miles every morning."
3,That's impressive.  I would like to try but I just don't have the stamina! Do you ever run with a dog?
3,"It's good to have a spotter! Also, get in overall good shape with an emphasis on balance"
3,"I don't have a dog, I just don't have the time to dedicate to a pet! Do you have any pets?"
3,Where should be go after the fitnes place? Would the ocean be a good spot?
3,Ha ha - not for rock climbing.  Maybe you are thinking of diving?
3,I was thinking about diving. I would love to see some real life mermaids.
3,"No pets, just a crowd of feral cats from the neighborhood that roam through the yard. Fun to watch."
3,You may need to limit yourself to Disneyland for mermaids.  They're not actually real.
3,"Oh that sounds funny, I like seeing cats roaming about the neighborhood. Cats are quiet creatures that really know how to take it easy!"
3,"We've had to step in a few times when one was injured, or a mama cat died. But they are timid creatures."
3,Thats not true. My mother told me they really exist.
4,How would I start rock climbing?
4,I am excited. I just hope they can get through today then the rest of the week will be easy.
4,I would suggest a fitness place with a rock wall.  Try that out in a safe environment
4,"I'm sure you'll do great. In second grade, that's where the kiddos will begin learning mathematics and science and social studies among other subjects"
4,I will do that. I will take my mom with me since she is my best friend.
4,"It's good to have a spotter! Also, get in overall good shape with an emphasis on balance"
4," I really don't know anyone around, but most of this neighborhood is young. What do you do for work?"
4,Where should be go after the fitnes place? Would the ocean be a good spot?
4,I work for a Mexican cartel that kidnaps 1st graders and sells them into slavery... ;) Just kidding
4,Ha ha - not for rock climbing.  Maybe you are thinking of diving?
4,haaa. well no one works if they don't have to. I took a year off traveling last year.
4,I'm only kidding lol. I am a veterinarian. I love dogs and cats! Well and children too :)
4,"cool. the only dogs and cats I see are dead, embalmed and on display. Guess where I work?"
4,I was thinking about diving. I would love to see some real life mermaids.
4,The morgue! ROFL
4,"haaa, a museum."
4,"That was my second guess :) but it was too late, I pressed the Send button"
4,You may need to limit yourself to Disneyland for mermaids.  They're not actually real.
4,Thats not true. My mother told me they really exist.
4,It's amazing. but it's the only people I know here. recommend any restaurants?
4,I see.  I wonder where she has seen them?
4,She saw them when she was younger. I will believe my best friend since I know my mother well.
4,"McDonald's? :) Just kidding... Well I don't even know where you live, but I'd say SoHo Sushi is my fave"
4,Far be it to argue with anyone's mother!  Do you have siblings?
5,I am excited. I just hope they can get through today then the rest of the week will be easy.
5,It's really great to have the memories.
5,"I'm sure you'll do great. In second grade, that's where the kiddos will begin learning mathematics and science and social studies among other subjects"
5,What do your kids look back at the pictures you kept of theme over the years
5,Usually pictures of their families and their pets that they love so much.
5," I really don't know anyone around, but most of this neighborhood is young. What do you do for work?"
5,"Pets are part of the family like humans, what typ of pets do you have if any"
5,I have one cat but I want to get another! Do you have any pets?
5,"I have 2 dogs, oreo and cupcake, they are goldendoodles"
5,I work for a Mexican cartel that kidnaps 1st graders and sells them into slavery... ;) Just kidding
5,haaa. well no one works if they don't have to. I took a year off traveling last year.
5,I'm only kidding lol. I am a veterinarian. I love dogs and cats! Well and children too :)
5,"Wow, I've never heard of goldendoodles before. That's a bit hard to pronounce with my accent!"
5,"cool. the only dogs and cats I see are dead, embalmed and on display. Guess where I work?"
5,The morgue! ROFL
5,"They are a cross of a poodle and golden retreiver, they make great family dogs, kids love them"
6,It's really great to have the memories.
6,Mine is green.
6,"Thats cool, most shades of green are named after plants."
6,What do your kids look back at the pictures you kept of theme over the years
6,Do you like this time of year? I like the change in seasons but not very fond of the cold weather that comes in winter
6,I like it. I wish the weather was a nicer. Winter lasts too long?
6,Usually pictures of their families and their pets that they love so much.
6,"Winter does feel like it can drag on, I just try to remember the next season is spring, I like spring the weather is great late spring"
6,"Pets are part of the family like humans, what typ of pets do you have if any"
6,I have one cat but I want to get another! Do you have any pets?
6,"I have 2 dogs, oreo and cupcake, they are goldendoodles"
6,"Wow, I've never heard of goldendoodles before. That's a bit hard to pronounce with my accent!"
6,"They are a cross of a poodle and golden retreiver, they make great family dogs, kids love them"
6,"That sounds so cute. My kitty could really use a friend, maybe I'll get a goldendoodle!"
6,Have you ever visited any other cities? I may go on a trip this winter.
6,Cats can be picky if you do get one get a puppy so they get along
6,"That's a smart idea, I want my kitty to feel at home. Do you like cats?"
6,"I have been to many cities around the world, try to avoid cities that have rainy seasons or get too cold in winter"
7,"Ok that's interesting, how do you know about that?"
7,Wow that is a lot. I've definitely seen plenty when I holiday at Lake Michigan
7,Hershey's is the pinnacle of chocolate and have been relevant for years and years.
7,That is a nice place to holiday. Lake Michigan is so big!
7,"I don't eat much chocolate, I try to keep in shape for Cross Country"
7,Everything is good in moderation. I personally believe eating too much of something is the issue here.
7,"I agree, how much Hersheys do you eat?"
7,Yeah it really is! Where do you go on holidays?
7,We like to explore around New England but our favorite holiday spot is in the Virgin Islands National Park.
7,"Being from Georgia, I developed quite the sweet tooth in my younger days. However now I tend to have a Hershey's once in a while."
7,"Oh cool, i've always wanted to go to the Virgin islands, I love seafood so think it would be a great place to try some"

10,"I like the outdoors type, the ones based in Alaska are interesting"
10,"i have seen cop shows based in alaska, there's a lot of socioeconomic issues up there"
10,I think like many reality shows they exaggerate how bad things are for ratings
10,"yeah, for sure. they make their own narrative to make a more interesting watching experience"
10,Do you have any other siblings besides your sister?
10,An older brother was well. What about yourself?
10,I do have a younger sister as well.
10,Some of the home improvement reality shows are interesting but they make their job look easier than it is
10,Nice! Are you an aunt or uncle yet?
10,Yes I am.
10,That's exciting! Do you have a niece or nephew?
10,"As a matter of fact, both!"
10,it looks easy when they can condense months of work into 30 minute - 1 hour episodes
10,"that's true, I wish they would show more of the work it takes to get a project started and completed"
10,That's awesome. Any tips?
11,"I am surprised how many reality tv shows are on air, what's your favorite type"
11,Really? That has been around for awhile then.
11,Yeah isn't that crazy. I love geysers. Have you ever seen one in person?
11,i like ones that aren't too scripted. there's one from japan called terrace house that is nice
11,One time I was in a large group of people but couldn't get a very good look because of all the tall people in front of me.
11,Oh no! I am pretty tall so I don't have that problem. Except everyone looks at me funny in public.
11,"I like the outdoors type, the ones based in Alaska are interesting"
11,"But, you can always grab things off the top shelf. That is a challenge for me!"
11,That's true. It has lots of advantages! Do you like hiking?
11,"i have seen cop shows based in alaska, there's a lot of socioeconomic issues up there"

11,"that's true, I wish they would show more of the work it takes to get a project started and completed"
11,i do understand that it makes for better watching to have a really drastic before and after shot without all the gritty work details
11,I love it when the leaves turn colors.
12,Really? That has been around for awhile then.
12,I do enjoy a good horror movie and then humor after.
12,Yeah isn't that crazy. I love geysers. Have you ever seen one in person?
12,One time I was in a large group of people but couldn't get a very good look because of all the tall people in front of me.
12,I like to watch dark comedies like Barry on HBO starring Bill Hader. It's funny and has some dramatic parts to it.
12,Oh no! I am pretty tall so I don't have that problem. Except everyone looks at me funny in public.
12,"But, you can always grab things off the top shelf. That is a challenge for me!"

12,Yeah gotta love Bill Hader. Have you seen his series of mockumentaries called Documentary Now?
12,I would love to go to New England to see the leaves in the fall sometime. I hear it is very pretty. 
12,"No I have not, do you recommend to watch?"
12,"It's hilarious, just wish I had more time to watch his stuff"
12,I went there once about 4 years ago in the fall. It's so beautiful!
12,Guess I will have to binge watch the series to get caught up with everything.
13,I do enjoy a good horror movie and then humor after.
13,"lol i cant even do it with the quad kind, i just fall over anyway"
13,I fall from time to time as well

13,for some reason tho the time i went ice skating i was totally fine 
13,Guess I will have to binge watch the series to get caught up with everything.
13,I prefer ice skating rings with rails just in case I fall I can grab on to something
13,if they don't have those you can always use your friends 
13,"Yes that's true, I just wouldn't want them to fall with me either"
13,"yea i feel that. tho i think when i was younger i wouldn't think of that at all, since falling over is not as big a deal lol"
13,"Yes, me and my friends took more risks when we were younger, not taking that chance now"
13,What are you fave shows to binge watch?
13,The Office and Breaking Bad!
13,Nice. The Office is one of my favorite shows. I do enjoy Steve Carrell's character.
13,it would feel real bad to have to deal with a like serious injury over something as silly as that 
14,"lol i cant even do it with the quad kind, i just fall over anyway"
14,"No not at all, I have plenty of male friends"
14,I think that is a good thing.
14,"Yeah, although now you have me thinking about it, I don't think I am very comfortable about how much time he spends with her..."
14,I fall from time to time as well
14,for some reason tho the time i went ice skating i was totally fine 
14,I can see why that would bother you.
14,I prefer ice skating rings with rails just in case I fall I can grab on to something
14,"haha yeah, so how about you, do you have a partner?"
14,Yes I do have a partner and I am comfortable with him having females friends.
14,if they don't have those you can always use your friends 
14,That's great to hear. What's your favorite activity to do with him?
14,We both love riding motorcycles and playing put-put.
14,"Oh cool, i have played put-put a few times but I'm really bad at it"
14,"Yes that's true, I just wouldn't want them to fall with me either"
14,"yea i feel that. tho i think when i was younger i wouldn't think of that at all, since falling over is not as big a deal lol"
14,"Well maybe you can become better at it, if it's something that you enjoyed"
14,"Yes, me and my friends took more risks when we were younger, not taking that chance now"
14,it would feel real bad to have to deal with a like serious injury over something as silly as that 
14,"Yes, even moving large furniture, I would rather have professionals move it than risk hurting my back"
14,"back injuries are really the worst, those will mess you up for life. even lighter stuff you can wrench it the wrong way and get messed up"
14,Yeah I would like to try again
14,"you should give it a go , what do you do for work ?"
14,"That's why I stick to easier activities like skating instead of rock climbing, lol"
15,"No not at all, I have plenty of male friends"
15,My coworker decided to pay for the lunch and I will repay once back at the office.
15,I think that is a good thing.
15,That was nice of him!
15,"Yeah, although now you have me thinking about it, I don't think I am very comfortable about how much time he spends with her..."
15,I can see why that would bother you.
15,Next time I will make sure not to forget my wallet again.
15,"haha yeah, so how about you, do you have a partner?"
15,Yes I do have a partner and I am comfortable with him having females friends.
15,That's great to hear. What's your favorite activity to do with him?
15,We both love riding motorcycles and playing put-put.
15,"Oh cool, i have played put-put a few times but I'm really bad at it"
15,I bet it was a pretty embarassing situation! I've forgotten my wallet before.
15,"Yes it was!, but it was a lesson learned  to not forget again."
15,"Well maybe you can become better at it, if it's something that you enjoyed"
15,Definitely. Where did you go to lunch?
15,Yeah I would like to try again
15,"you should give it a go , what do you do for work ?"
15,Went to a nice sushi spot around down town.
16,My coworker decided to pay for the lunch and I will repay once back at the office.
16,it is harder some days than others. but it is good you get along with your mom so well
16,It is.  How was your relationship with your parents?
16,That was nice of him!
16,Next time I will make sure not to forget my wallet again.
16,"it was good, this happened in my adult life so we all had work and stuff and maybe did not socialize as often as we could have"
16,I understand.  I guess I tend to socialize with my cat the most.  He is almost like family.
16,I bet it was a pretty embarassing situation! I've forgotten my wallet before.
16,"Yes it was!, but it was a lesson learned  to not forget again."
16,Definitely. Where did you go to lunch?
16,Went to a nice sushi spot around down town.
16,i think pets can be family for sure. just hanging out with them and petting them can be really calming
16,I love sushi! We should go sometime!
16,"Most definitely, except when he knocks stuff off of tables.  Do you have any pets?"
16,"i used to have a cat that was really bad about that, couldn't have anything on tables at all. but now i have a dog and a couple cats"
16,How does your dog get along with the cats?
16,they mostly just ignore each other. the cats are actually bigger than him so they never really seem worried about his presence
16,That would be a good idea to meet up and enjoy some lovely sushi.
17,it is harder some days than others. but it is good you get along with your mom so well
17,Haha I wish! My ex texted me the other day. She apparently still loves me.
17,"Huh, but why did you break up in the first place?"
17,We wanted different things in the future. She wanted kids and I didn't. Stuff like that.
17,It is.  How was your relationship with your parents?
17,Do you think either of you have changed your minds on that stuff?
17,I have. I think I want kids now.
17,Maybe you guys could try hanging out again before jumping back into dating. Did you stay friends after breaking up?
17,"it was good, this happened in my adult life so we all had work and stuff and maybe did not socialize as often as we could have"
17,"Somewhat. We have both dated a couple other people, but we see each other at parties and stuff. Hanging out before dating is a good idea."
17,I understand.  I guess I tend to socialize with my cat the most.  He is almost like family.
17,"I think it'd be fine if you guys tried angling towards dating again then, if you are also into it. Just don't feel pressured by her feelings!"
17,Maybe I'll ask her to go on a walk with me at a park this weekend. 
17,"That could be nice, it'd be a good chance to talk and get caught up."
17,i think pets can be family for sure. just hanging out with them and petting them can be really calming
17,"Definitely. And see if we are on the same page, possibly, for the future. No need to rush into things."
17,"Most definitely, except when he knocks stuff off of tables.  Do you have any pets?"
17,"i used to have a cat that was really bad about that, couldn't have anything on tables at all. but now i have a dog and a couple cats"
17,How does your dog get along with the cats?
17,Definitely. Going from being exes to dating and definitely having kids would be way too fast.
18,Haha I wish! My ex texted me the other day. She apparently still loves me.
18,Do you have a favorite game?
18,Yes I do and that is playing Sudoka.
18,"Huh, but why did you break up in the first place?"
18,We wanted different things in the future. She wanted kids and I didn't. Stuff like that.
18,Do you think either of you have changed your minds on that stuff?
18,Sudoka? Is that similar to sudoku?
18,I have. I think I want kids now.
18,Maybe you guys could try hanging out again before jumping back into dating. Did you stay friends after breaking up?
18,"This one is the ultimate version of it, it is worth checking out"
18,"Somewhat. We have both dated a couple other people, but we see each other at parties and stuff. Hanging out before dating is a good idea."
18,I'll definitely check it out! Where do you play?
18,I just at home when I have the chance.
18,"Nice! Do you have a book of sudoka, or do you play on a computer?"
18,I do have several books that I like to play through.
18,"I think it'd be fine if you guys tried angling towards dating again then, if you are also into it. Just don't feel pressured by her feelings!"
18,Maybe I'll ask her to go on a walk with me at a park this weekend. 
18,Nice! I am heading to the mall in Chicago tomorrow. I will have to pick up a book!
18,"That could be nice, it'd be a good chance to talk and get caught up."
18,"That sounds nice, I have never been to Chicago, but pics of the place seems so nice."
18,"Definitely. And see if we are on the same page, possibly, for the future. No need to rush into things."
18,"It is a little too crowded for my tastes, but it is a decent place to live. "
18,I'm sure it is. Maybe I'll visit too
18,Definitely. Going from being exes to dating and definitely having kids would be way too fast.
19,Do you have a favorite game?
19,Interesting. I've never played billiards.
19,Yes I do and that is playing Sudoka.
19,In the past the umbrella term was billiards
19,Sudoka? Is that similar to sudoku?
19,Is it similar to snooker?
19,I have never heard of this before.
19,I think snooker is another cue sport. Not sure how similar it is to billiards.
19,"That information is very interesting, will have to check that out."
19,"This one is the ultimate version of it, it is worth checking out"
19,Look up Ronnie O'Sullivan sometime. I've heard he is pretty good at snooker.
19,I'll definitely check it out! Where do you play?
19,thanks i will have to look into it .
19,I just at home when I have the chance.
19,"Nice! Do you have a book of sudoka, or do you play on a computer?"

28,Yeah. Do you ever use the blue light filter feature on your devices? 
28,No what is that?
28,I learned on my own by just watching youtube videos of other people playing.

31,Did you used to feel it?
31,"Well, it being your birthday and autumn, how about I treat you to a pumpkin spice latte at the local cafe while we study?"
31,Maybe when I was younger. I have been a chronic cappuccino consumer for decades now. 
31,Are cappuccinos expensive?
31,Not really. They average about $4.00 per large serving. 
31,Sounds great! I need to go back to the dorm and get my books tho.

32,You should totally be an equine veterinarian and work with horses every day
32,I would love to do that for a living.
32,"horses are so cool. My parents are doctors, it's a good life whether for people or for animals"
32,Do you want to become a doctor?
32,Not sure if I could live up to the standard of my parents.

32,oh boy. they are. some of that could really make one's day 
32,Any big plans for your weekend?
32,What do you want to do for work?
32,I haven't planned anything yet. What about you? 
33,I need to learn as much as I can about horses because I want my  own stable.

34,That's funny...maybe it was the type of cheese that they used.
34,How awesome! My father loved to cook for my family as well when he was home from deployment.
34,What is your favorite thing he made for you?
34,He made the absolute best chicken parmesan!

34,Ohh I love me some chicken parme Reminds me of that Peyton Manning commercial!
34,Yes! I am actually currently analyzing that commercial for my television production class! Its the last class I need before receiving my Bachelors degree.
34,Do you know what kind of cheese they used? Like usually we use cheddar now.
34,"I don't, but whatever it was I bet it was delicious. Imagine how it was just from the same cow"
34,"Back then they could of made it with goat milk, but whatever animal they milked it was definitely fresh? And the pasta...I love fresh pasta."
34,That is great! I have a BA in IT that I received last year.

35,whoa. it does take a lot. well me and my wife are a team . our daughter needs us. i hope you can find someone to help out 
35,We definitely have a lazy lifestyle at home since I just like to relax after work. Sometimes I think i should get out and exercise more.
35,well i do make time to go outdoors with my kids. so that's where i get in some physical activity
35,I used to love the outdoors before I became a CEO and now the most outdoors I get is walking from my corvette to the office building.
35,You don't think so?
35,its really hard to keep up a schedule. but hey i tend to feel better when i eat better. do you watch your diet?
35,"I don't consider her a rapper, she's an okay rapper for a singer."
35,Why isn't she a rapper?
35,Because she is a singer. She doesn't make rap songs.
35,I try to eat at higher quality restaurants but being on the road for business doesn't always allow that. I stay at hotels and order out a lot.
35, when do you go on the road again
35,But rap songs were on her last couple of albums.
35,I go on the road when I have to check on other franchises for my company.
35,"Ok, so give me an example of why you think she is a better rapper than Jay-Z..."
36,That's all important. He's okay. Who else do you like?

36,its really heart breaking. i'm so glad to have made good memories. it would be tragic if i had regrets

36,Jay-Z
36,Tbh I think his wife is a better rapper than he is ;)
36,lol
36,"Absolutely, it's a chapter of your life and as long as you have those memories they live on through those memories."
36,You don't think so?
36,That is a really good way of looking at it. And you can share those memories with new people in your life and breathe life into them.
36,You are so right. It can make all the difference.
36,"I don't consider her a rapper, she's an okay rapper for a singer."
36,Why isn't she a rapper?
36,Do you have other family members to help you after your loss?
37,I'm really sorry to hear that. Losing two family members in such a short timespan is really heartbreaking. 
37,Not that I wanted to take... maybe I'll just take the semester off...

37,I love New Orleans. I bet you'd fit right in!
37,"I practice my act with my parrot named Parrot. I'm Polly Pirate so she asks me if ""Polly want a cracker?"" It's a comedy act."
37,"We keep in touch, but all my immediate family lives rather far. So it is just me and my dogs at home."
37,Sounds like you have some real talent there.  Keep up the good work.  I bet you'll be famous one day!
37,I guess all my classes that I wanted to take being full is a true sign! Maybe I'll even take this to America's Got Talent one day! 
37,so how do you feel about cancer...
37,"You're right, perhaps it's divine intervention!"
37,Is there any other sort of intervention in life that puts you on the right track in life?!
37,"It is really hard to watch people go through it, whether they decide to get treatment or just accept it."
38,Not that I wanted to take... maybe I'll just take the semester off...

39,"Extremely nervous, actually. But I haven't had that big of an issue since my speech course in college. Lucky for me I passed."
39,there is a course for anything isnt there
39,Honestly yes. You didn't take a recommended speech course in college? I swear it was mandatory
39,i didnt take it that seriously. honestly hate speeches
39,authentic american cuisine.. we're pretty much going for the bar and wine selection
39,Do they ever have a wine tasting?
39,"I get that. Even though it was mandatory, I'm glad I took it since I obviously needed it due to me running for political office back in 2004"
39,well you see. i know i would never go for a career where i would have to be that out there. its good that its mandatory though
39,"not sure , there may be many during the week. seeing that they're new in town "
39,Sounds like something my wife would drag me to.
39,that might be a good idea ! you should take her out to dinner too. dont wait on her to drag you
39,Maybe for our anniversary.
39,Yeah that's why I went to school for computer hardware in case the political thing flopped. I build my own computers and run my own store now
39,well i'll have to let you know if that restaurant is a go!
40,anything i do i try to do great at it. i'd say i gave it my best. i was satisfied 
40,It's amazing how a little kindness from strangers can go such a long way.
40,"I understand, but at least you were prepared and you feel accomplished."
40,"He thought I was cute and old fashioned since I wore a locket. I still love to line dry my clothes! Nothing better, I say!"
40,I agree with you! The way linens smell after being air dried is way better than any dryer sheet
40,you dont get nervous to speak infront of crowds?
40,"A word of advice, always hang your clothes higher than your goats can reach! I learned that early on living on a homestead! Explains the missing socks!"
40,"Extremely nervous, actually. But I haven't had that big of an issue since my speech course in college. Lucky for me I passed."
40,Oh wow yeah! I never thought about that. I don't raise animals but my neighbor does. I do like to hunt deer from time to time.
40,there is a course for anything isnt there
40,"We've had so many animals but their all for slaughter or use on the farm, chickens for eggs, goats for milk, ya know.... we hunt a lot as well."
40,Honestly yes. You didn't take a recommended speech course in college? I swear it was mandatory
40,"That's great. I love animals, but I also love the thrill of the hunt. I use a bow to make it more interesting."
40,"Wow! A bow! You're a true hunter! Ya know, all these animals I've owned but I've never had a true indoor pet?"
40,"Really? Man, pets are great too. I am lost without my dog."
40,i didnt take it that seriously. honestly hate speeches
40,I'll one day own a ferret. I've been selling our extra eggs at the market to save up for one!
40,Keep at it! Ferrets are cute little things. Where would you put it?
40,I'd cage it at night but take it with me during the day. Ferrets are canines so you can train them like dogs.
40,"I get that. Even though it was mandatory, I'm glad I took it since I obviously needed it due to me running for political office back in 2004"
41,It's amazing how a little kindness from strangers can go such a long way.

45,I always look for mountains and snow when I am going somewhere new so that I can use my snowboard
46,"Yes, finally. Do you enjoy long drives?"
46,"i work as a personal trainer , 5 days a week so i had enough strength to pull myself out of the window before the engine exploded."
46,Wow! That is amazing! You are so lucky. I am not that strong. It must have been scary.
46,Yes they are great. I love just getting in the car and stoppingonly when I am in another place.
46,I agree. One time I drove for 10 hours in one direction and had no idea where I was going
46,"I live n Las Vegas, Nevada so I was bound to encounter a drunk driver one day. I thank God for saving my life that night."
46,"Yes, God is good! I have never been to Vegas. How long have you lived there?"
46,Was this before GPS or did you just leave it off
46,My whole life. Born and raised! I'm thankful I found Jesus before I found out about the sins of Sin City.
46,"Ha! So true! I am from Tennessee, the Bible Belt. We sure know Jesus!"
46,"I love tennessee! I have property in the small town of 5000, Ashland City that I visit often. Gets me away from the city."

46,Wow what a nice coincidence!
46,I always look for mountains and snow when I am going somewhere new so that I can use my snowboard
46,About 40 minutes west of Nashville. They have a wildlife refuge area which is where my property is. It's like being in a backwards zoo!
46,That sounds like a lot of fun! Which mountains?
47,"i work as a personal trainer , 5 days a week so i had enough strength to pull myself out of the window before the engine exploded."
47,Wow. is there repercussions 
47,"Yes, if a whistleblower tells, the company can get in trouble. They can get big fines for exploitation of workers."
47,Wow! That is amazing! You are so lucky. I am not that strong. It must have been scary.
47,Thats terrible have you ever witnessed this personally
47,"I live n Las Vegas, Nevada so I was bound to encounter a drunk driver one day. I thank God for saving my life that night."
47,"Yes, God is good! I have never been to Vegas. How long have you lived there?"
47,"No, I own a small business. I can only afford to pay my workers minimum wage, but I treat them well. I have heard stories about horrible working conditions."
47,I work night shift at a hotel. I hate my job
47,My whole life. Born and raised! I'm thankful I found Jesus before I found out about the sins of Sin City.
47,I am so sorry to hear that. Why do you hate your job?
47,I dont enjoy working nights. I would rather work during the day
47,"Ha! So true! I am from Tennessee, the Bible Belt. We sure know Jesus!"
47,"I love tennessee! I have property in the small town of 5000, Ashland City that I visit often. Gets me away from the city."
47,"Yes, that is hard to work the night shift. Is there a reason your boss won't let you work days?"
47,That is awesome! Where is Ashland City? 
47,There is no openings and I was the last to start
48,Wow. is there repercussions 
48,"No, I work with chemicals. Did you always want to be an engineer?"
48,Yes I have wanted to be an engineer for many years.
48,Likewise. My parents were scientist and it inspired me to follow in that field. Why are you in this field?
48,"Yes, if a whistleblower tells, the company can get in trouble. They can get big fines for exploitation of workers."
48,I want to innovate for future generations.
48,Very nice. Any ideas so far?
48,Thats terrible have you ever witnessed this personally
48,"No, I own a small business. I can only afford to pay my workers minimum wage, but I treat them well. I have heard stories about horrible working conditions."
48,I work night shift at a hotel. I hate my job
48,"Yeah, we need to reduce emissions right now."
48,I am so sorry to hear that. Why do you hate your job?
48,I dont enjoy working nights. I would rather work during the day
48,I agree. Currently at my workplace we have a team working on reducing emissions. Are you currently working anywhere?
48,"Yes, that is hard to work the night shift. Is there a reason your boss won't let you work days?"
48,"Yes, I work in a medium sized firm in Portland. Where are you from?"
48,There is no openings and I was the last to start
48,I currently reside in a small town near Illinois. Have you ever been to Illinois?
48,"Yes, that is usually how it works. Are there any other hotels hiring for a day shift near you?"
49,"No, I work with chemicals. Did you always want to be an engineer?"
49,Netflix original shows are the best in my opinon 
49,I do like the Netflix originals. I also love the British shows as I am from London. You will love Netflix. There are so many choices!

49,4 boys and 2 girls. I have a huge family!
49,Wow! That is wonderful! They will get so much use out of Netflix. The selection for kids is terrific.
49,We have watched every show on there I think!
49,"Yeah, we need to reduce emissions right now."
49,I can believe it. It is quite addictive. We have binged quite a few shows. Do you have a favorite show?
49,I agree. Currently at my workplace we have a team working on reducing emissions. Are you currently working anywhere?
49,Bojack horeseman yours?
49,"Yes, I work in a medium sized firm in Portland. Where are you from?"
50,Netflix original shows are the best in my opinon 
50,Does your mom get scared?
50,Not really! It's mostly myself who gets scared.
50,Im not a big fan of heights myselg!
50,I do like the Netflix originals. I also love the British shows as I am from London. You will love Netflix. There are so many choices!
50,Me and my family all really enjoy Netflix!
50,"My sister is the opposite of you. She has a passion for heights - she could dance along a cliff edge, it wouldn't bother her a bit."
50,Do you have children?
50,4 boys and 2 girls. I have a huge family!
50,Wow! That is wonderful! They will get so much use out of Netflix. The selection for kids is terrific.
50,Wow that sounds awful to me! I would much rather be in a casino lol
50,Yeah I don't have the best luck in casinos either.
50,We have watched every show on there I think!
50,I still like to gamble though
50,"One time I went on a casino cruise and met a mermaid. Now I know for sure, they are real. I believe."
50,I have never seen one in real life 
50,I can believe it. It is quite addictive. We have binged quite a few shows. Do you have a favorite show?
51,I am 22. I also love science
51,"I have trouble remembering, I just think about how they taste"
51,"Yeah, it's hard remembering anything if you're like myself, working the same job for 8 whole years. "
51,"I love eating barbeque sandwiches. We served them at my birthday party, along with pizza puffs. I love science too, but not as much as pizza puffs."
51,I am a scientist for a living
51,i am 19 and still in school. Scientist sounds interesting!
51,Oh wow that't a long time to be in one job! What do you do?
51,"I work in marketing. It's kinda cut throat sometimes. When I get home, I put some rolling stones on and it all melts away."
51,Mmm what a way to relax!
51,It is the best. That and the beatles haha!
51,It certainly does put me in a good emotional state. They're my favorite band after all.
51,oh yes the beatles are the best of the best. but are they better than barbeque sandwiches? 
51,Oh yeah
51,"Cool, I prefer opera myself, there's just something about it that soothes me"
51,"Honestly, opera can be so cool."
51,too bad the beatles are not around anymore. Sometimes I like to imagine John Lennon is right here with me.
51,He is in spirit
51,"Yes, he was the best musician ever."
51,"I'm glad you think so, most people just don't appreciate it at all"
51,They all were great
51,Most people don't appreciate anything worthwhile.
52,"I have trouble remembering, I just think about how they taste"
52,Thanks for your support! Hopefully I will make it as an actor!
52,"You're welcome. Well, an actor in the background is still a very important actor. Maybe you'll be in a lead role someday!"
52,"Yeah, it's hard remembering anything if you're like myself, working the same job for 8 whole years. "
52,Oh wow that't a long time to be in one job! What do you do?
52,"Thanks, you're right! How about you? What do you want to do?"
52,"I work in marketing. It's kinda cut throat sometimes. When I get home, I put some rolling stones on and it all melts away."
52,Make more money! It totally blows working at scrubway. 
52,I can imagine. What do you think you would be good at?
52,"Not too sure, but I never want to disappoint my family. That's why I'm in college for engineering."
52,Mmm what a way to relax!
52,It certainly does put me in a good emotional state. They're my favorite band after all.
52,"Nice, well engineering can definitely get you a high paying job"
52,"Cool, I prefer opera myself, there's just something about it that soothes me"
52,"It totally can. Anyway enough about me, you got any cool hobbies?"
52,"Theatre pretty much consumes my life at the moment, but I love it"
52,Any favorite actors?
52,"Honestly, opera can be so cool."
52,Can I say myself? Haha
53,Thanks for your support! Hopefully I will make it as an actor!
53,"Nah, we never could afford the fancy things. Best I had was out of a can!"
53,"You're welcome. Well, an actor in the background is still a very important actor. Maybe you'll be in a lead role someday!"
53,"Thanks, you're right! How about you? What do you want to do?"
53,"Well, you get experience points on that. Hopefully, the next dish is better."
53,I'm sure it would be if I could find a way to heat it up! Usually that makes it better.
53,"You ate the dish cold?! That sounds vile, it really needs to be hot."
53,Make more money! It totally blows working at scrubway. 
53,I can imagine. What do you think you would be good at?
53,Yeah I did. But I was on my boat fishing at the time. I was in the middle of the lake and got hungry. That can was all I had.
53,I suppose if you're starving you wouldn't really care if its hot or cold. Why didn't you eat one of the fish that you caught?
53,Hadn't caught any yet. Plus they are hard to cook on a little boat. Do you eat raw fish?
53,"Not too sure, but I never want to disappoint my family. That's why I'm in college for engineering."
53,"Yes I suppose it would be hard to cook. I've had sushi which is raw, is it not?"
53,"Nice, well engineering can definitely get you a high paying job"
54,"Nah, we never could afford the fancy things. Best I had was out of a can!"
54,I gave the cash I had to a homeless guy by the art gallery.
54,is he still there maybe? hope so. Remember the movie Groundhog Day. It was the homeless guys last day
54,"Well, you get experience points on that. Hopefully, the next dish is better."
54,I'm sure it would be if I could find a way to heat it up! Usually that makes it better.
54,"You ate the dish cold?! That sounds vile, it really needs to be hot."
54,I don't watch much TV. I spend most days painting. 
54,Yeah I did. But I was on my boat fishing at the time. I was in the middle of the lake and got hungry. That can was all I had.
54,I suppose if you're starving you wouldn't really care if its hot or cold. Why didn't you eat one of the fish that you caught?
54,Hadn't caught any yet. Plus they are hard to cook on a little boat. Do you eat raw fish?
54,"Yes I suppose it would be hard to cook. I've had sushi which is raw, is it not?"
54,"Yeah, but I'm sure that didn't include the head did it?"
54,"TV is good to fall asleep to, i've wanted to start painting but being a nurse keeps me busy"
54,"How do you handle being a nurse, working with so many people? I get so nervous around people."
54,I like being busy and helping people is fun.
54,"Don't think it did, what is wrong with eating the head?"
54,I guess I'll always be a shy person. I doubt that my date calls me back. I think you were right.
55,I gave the cash I had to a homeless guy by the art gallery.
55,"Awesome! I was so close to there when I was hiking one day, but I had to return home for it was getting dark."
55,"Haha, I don't like walking in the dark either."
55,is he still there maybe? hope so. Remember the movie Groundhog Day. It was the homeless guys last day
55,I don't watch much TV. I spend most days painting. 
55,"Indeed, speaking of dark, what type of chocolate do you prefer most? I prefer vegan 100 percent cocoa."
55,"TV is good to fall asleep to, i've wanted to start painting but being a nurse keeps me busy"
55,"How do you handle being a nurse, working with so many people? I get so nervous around people."
55,I like Almond milk chocolate.  I'm glad chocolate has health benefits as well.
55,"Me too! It contains so many antibiotics, no wonder it was used in medicine many years ago, and today as well."
55,I like being busy and helping people is fun.
55,"Chocolate is not just good for the body, but for the soul as well."
55,I guess I'll always be a shy person. I doubt that my date calls me back. I think you were right.
55,"Very true, the ancients used it very often as a treat. Also, I think I meant antioxidants, not antibiotics... "
55,no worries; I knew what you meant.
55,Thanks! I'm glad there's someone whom understands chocolate and me!
55,"Since you like it so much, you should visit Chocolate World if you get the chance. There are shops and restaurants there too."
55,"Cool, thanks! Perhaps I could hike there someday soon during the spring time."
55,Yeah you should go there!
55,Are you going to call your data back?
56,They're 6 and 9
56,"Indeed, but more nervous. Ironic for I teach yoga..."
56,That is so neat. Are they at the age that they like the Australian Band Hi-5? My kids love to binge watch their show!
56,Yes they absolutely love it!! They watch it on their tablets in the car!
56,That is so awesome. I hope it gets there before this weekend so you can binge it!
56,Oh absolutely! It's amazing.
56,"Hey, I bet that's an interesting job. I actually have never done yoga! I keeping meaning to, but sometimes I hear voices telling me that it's a bad idea!"
56,"Thanks, I teach yoga on weekdays, I work at the red cross other days. I hope this date day goes well."
56,My 5-year-old twins love it!
56,Oh I bet they do! Are they boys or girls?! What are there names?
56,A boy and a girl. Thomas and Abigale.
56,I've got my fingers crossed for you! Where are you going?
56,oh that's adorable. Are they well behaved?
56,"Thanks, I'm going to the gym where I used to do yoga a few times a week. I turned it into a living by recording my yoga and teaching."
56,They are most of the time; Thomas always seems to get into trouble when he comes with me to feed the horses.
56,Sounds awesome! We have a fitness center locally that offers tanning beds and massages.  i was thinking of joining just for that.
56,"That sounds great, I would love too. Also, talking to you has made me less nervous. Thanks."
56,definitely ! it was nice chatting with you too !
56,"Horses are exciting though, can you blame them?! Mine are just the same."
56,"Thanks, I'm almost getting ready to go now. I'm looking forward to that meeting you offered!"
56,Nope; can't blame them at all. Especially since my horses are very patient and good with kids.
56,Yes I am looking forward to the meeting too! What are you going to wear to your date?!
57,That's cool! What was the heaviest weight you lifted?
57,Do they have a car show associated with it? I like looking at suped up toyota cars.
57,"i only like toyota vehicles. I have a corolla and they drive amazingly,"
57,"My max is 180 lbs, but different days I target different muscle groups with different exercises."
57,I had a corolla for several years too. I want to get a Tacoma pickup soon.
57,Nice - They are very fun to drive. I love these music festivals though. Love the food too!
57,What kind of food do they have there?
57,"Excellent, thank's for letting me know. I remember taking protein supplements back in the day, they were sorta good. Do you take any?  "
57,Pretty much food you would find at a fair. All things fried...including cheese. I LOVE cheese.
57,Do you like fried cheese? That is one of my favorites.
57,"Yes, I enjoy the peanut butter protein powder a few times a week.  I also like to eat clean and meal prep. Do you meal prep?"
57,Cool. I enjoy cocoa and milk as a source of protein. I used to meal prep often before going to class. 
57,oh yes! Cheese is one of my favorite foods!
57,its almost the hollidays. You're combination reminds me of hot chocolate. I just drink the protein shake before working out. What did you study?
57,i love queso too.
57,especially white queso with some chips - yes! What is your favorite type of food?
57,"Thanks, I usually heat the combination, and thus the drink is a healthier 3 ingredient hot cocoa, water, milk cocoa. I studied math and art. "
57,That's awesome. I was terribel at math.
57,I like Mexican food a lot. We are doing a taco bar for dinner.
57,"I love that - Have you ever heard of ""Walking tacos""? This is where you take an individual bag of doritos or fritos, and have all of the fixings."
57,Thanks. I think I did a bit better in art than math.
58,Do they have a car show associated with it? I like looking at suped up toyota cars.
58,"It was great. I enjoyed eating it while listening to Bach,"
58,"i only like toyota vehicles. I have a corolla and they drive amazingly,"
58,cool ! i'm listening to bach now
58,Really. Do you enjoy other classical composers?
58,I had a corolla for several years too. I want to get a Tacoma pickup soon.
58,"Bach is very good, he is regarded as of of the greatest of all time."
58,I am aware. I like all things classical. I really enjoy going to museums to view art.
58,I enjoy museims too. They remind me of my mother who died when I was young.
58,Nice - They are very fun to drive. I love these music festivals though. Love the food too!
58,What kind of food do they have there?
58,Pretty much food you would find at a fair. All things fried...including cheese. I LOVE cheese.
58,Do you like fried cheese? That is one of my favorites.
58,oh yes! Cheese is one of my favorite foods!
58,i love queso too.
58,especially white queso with some chips - yes! What is your favorite type of food?
58,I bet that was hard. Do you still struggle with that loss?
59,"It was great. I enjoyed eating it while listening to Bach,"
59,why do you think depression isn't a mental illness? 
59,I think it falls under a mood disorder and has different characteristics from mental illnesses
59,cool ! i'm listening to bach now
59,Really. Do you enjoy other classical composers?
59,such as? 
59,"Well, sometimes my art students are depressed and it takes a few days but they snap out of it. "
59,"Bach is very good, he is regarded as of of the greatest of all time."
59,and sometimes someone stays in bed for 2 weeks. There is clearly something wrong 
59,I am aware. I like all things classical. I really enjoy going to museums to view art.
59,Mental Illness and depression are difficult to deal with when you are isolated
59,I enjoy museims too. They remind me of my mother who died when I was young.
59,I bet that was hard. Do you still struggle with that loss?
59,there are a lot of unknowns when it comes to mental health because for the longest time we as a society ignored it 
60,That is so cool. Was the work difficult?
60,You sound very mature for your age.
60,Yes I don't have many friends because I am congnitively ahead of my peers
60,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you spend much time with your family then?"
60,"No, it was just boring painting the sides of dice all day."
60,That does so sound boring. I would work during the night shifts.
60,What factory do you work in?
60,We make showers and sinks. I sleep all day after my shift.
60,That sounds like hard work. I am trying to make it as a magician in Las Vegas.
60,That sounds like a magical career. I would not fall asleep watching that!
60,Magic is my life. I can read minds!
60,I do but my dad is super strict so I keep to myself or spend time with my mom. They say that I'm gifted. 
60,"Okay, what am I thinking now?"
60,I sense....a presence. Have you recently lost a loved one? They are trying to contact you.
60,"Well, genius is two parts discipline and one part natural ability so you'll probably appreciate your dad's perspective when you're as old as I am"
60,Thats correct! You'll have no problem making it in Las Vegas.
60,I am just worried about getting into a great college and getting far away from here
60,What worries you about it? Do you think you'll make friends easier in college?
60,I do think I'll find people on the same wavelength on which I am. 
60,I understand. I met my wife in college
60,Wow - that's awesome. That gives me hope. Are you still together?
60,Thank you. Have you ever used a ouija board?
60,"Yes- as you said, we've always been on the same wavelength"
61,You sound very mature for your age.
61,"Yes, I spent my week lusting after the neighborhood pool boy. "
61,Yes I don't have many friends because I am congnitively ahead of my peers
61,Thats not right. I think you should find better things to do.
61,Well I am very bothered by the voices I hear in my head. They told me to.
61,I have problems too. I am really afraid of heights. 
61,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you spend much time with your family then?"
61,So is the neighborhood pool boy! It is so hard having that problem.
61,I do but my dad is super strict so I keep to myself or spend time with my mom. They say that I'm gifted. 
61,"Well, genius is two parts discipline and one part natural ability so you'll probably appreciate your dad's perspective when you're as old as I am"
61,People tell me that my belief in mermaids being real is a problem. 
61,Mermaids are real! I have seen one in Mexico. She had red hair 
61,Thank you for saying that. I am as crazy as people say.
61,When I am trying to get the pool boy's attention I pretend to be a mermaid. Do you like going to the pool?
61,I am just worried about getting into a great college and getting far away from here
61,I do like going when the weather is nice.
61,What worries you about it? Do you think you'll make friends easier in college?
61,Can you dive ?
62,"My internet is really fast, so I can play all kinds of games. I like interacting with others online."

62,"Oh, how so?"
62,Asa Butterfield is a nice actor
62,"I don't know them, what else have they been in?"
62,I don't know. Harrison Ford is my favorite actor 
62,"I loved that movie 'The Fugitive', he was really good in that"
62,He was Han Solo in Star Wars. The bad boy of the galaxy
62,"yeah, that's good. Online gaming can have so many applications to help people as well as have fun"
62,"Do you play any games? If so, which ones?"
62,"Yes, the real break-out character"
62,mostly just people online . multiplayer . maybe i should make some real friends huh ?
62,that's my guy ! so i take it you like sci fi ?
62,"Haha, I do the same."
62,I always thought about recording the games i play and streaming it live 
62,"Well, my favorite book is 'Enders Game' but I do like Sci-fi in general. A lot of great sci-fi works entered public domain and I'm listening to them on audiobook"
62,That's a great idea! I like to listen to live streams when I walk.
63,Do you read much sci-fi?
63,"ah that sounds nice, you should though meditate. You'll find after a few sessions you'll be more at ease "
63,"I like to draw to relax, you know? Something about focus and giving my hands something to do just is very zen to me"
63,you ever do those adult coloring books? those can be relaxing 
63,I thought Ender was so cute.
63,"Yeah, although I tend to cut out portions and paste them into my bullet journal"
63,"Oh, how so?"
63,Asa Butterfield is a nice actor
63,oh? that's a clever idea I have an app on my phone thats semi adult coloring book. I can't find my color pencils anymore
63,"I don't know them, what else have they been in?"
63,"It's just not the same, I think there's a texture thing when coloring in real life"
63,I don't know. Harrison Ford is my favorite actor 
63,"Oh i fully agree, plus it gives you more creative control "
63,"I loved that movie 'The Fugitive', he was really good in that"
63,He was Han Solo in Star Wars. The bad boy of the galaxy
63,Yes that is definitely a plus!
63,I have to use color books cause I can't draw / scetch anything myself zero art skills
63,"You should try following a Bob Ross tutorial, you might surprise yourself"
63,haha I love bob ross / maybe someday I will try 
63,"Yes, the real break-out character"
63,Do you have any other hobbies?
63,that's my guy ! so i take it you like sci fi ?

64,"yes, I've heard of Radioactive.listen to music while running"
64,I really like listening to Imagine Dragons while I work in the garden. It's my favorite thing to do.

64,"I like to draw to relax, you know? Something about focus and giving my hands something to do just is very zen to me"
64,you ever do those adult coloring books? those can be relaxing 
64,"haaa, nice. how did you first hear about Imagine Dragons?"
64,"It was an accident, actually. I'm a big fantasy novel reader and was Googling dragons to find a new book and they came up on my search!"
64,"Yeah, although I tend to cut out portions and paste them into my bullet journal"
64,cool. I'm a big fan of Sci-fi. how many grand children do you have?
64,oh? that's a clever idea I have an app on my phone thats semi adult coloring book. I can't find my color pencils anymore
64,"It's just not the same, I think there's a texture thing when coloring in real life"
64,"I have 4, all boys! The eldest got married last spring and are expecting! This old man is about to be a great grandpa!"
64,awesome. Have you thought about buying a RV to visit all of them?
64,"Oh i fully agree, plus it gives you more creative control "
64,Yes that is definitely a plus!
64,I have. I'd go travel in winter when I don't have the garden to tend to.
65,"yes, I've heard of Radioactive.listen to music while running"
65,what would your channel be on?
65,"i think i would either make tutorials or maybe music reviews, but i haven't thought it through yet"

65,"Haha, that would be great. why do you have a greenhouse?"
65,They are awesome! I took my grandkids to a live concert of theirs. They laughed when they saw their old Pops getting down to their generation's music!
65,"You know I like gardening, the reason I bought my house was to have a backyard for my greenhouse"
65,"That makes sense. I mean, I bought a house, just so I could have somewhere to park my truck."
65,"haaa, nice. how did you first hear about Imagine Dragons?"
65,"It was an accident, actually. I'm a big fantasy novel reader and was Googling dragons to find a new book and they came up on my search!"

66,about 1 hour in the morning but it varies depending on if i am planting a fruit or something
66,"Interesting, perhaps I will check out a book on gardening soon. Do you see a doctor about your knees?"
66,I think the dinosaur exhibit is a permanent exhibit...

69,You need to learn some day. Do you drink beer? I like Coors.

70,Say sorry to her and develop your love!!

70,"it's decent, but honestly our bikes are overpriced"
70,so there are better places to buy bikes in the area?
70,"nah we've got the best quality around here, and I can probably get you a discount"
70,"i basically a fairly unhealthy eater.  What can I say, I love snacks."
70,We all love snacks. Why would we eat anything else.
70,Exactly! I try to eat healthy sometimes. but it's so easy to just grab junk food on the go and keep it moving.
70,that would be awesome. i'm glad I know a great biker mechanic!
70,Are you worried about your long term health?
70,It's just that it would be cheaper to fix a bike yourself than to pay us to do it
70,"I understand, I do repairs on my own car to save money sometimes."
70,"Yes, but I am not overweight and still a young guy.  I have many more years to be worried about my health."

76,"You know what, i have always secretly wanted to date red hair as a partner and I hope I will one day"
76,That would be fantastic! Thank you so much!
76,I know a lot of people who you might like. Maybe I can set you up with one of my friends
76,"no problem, are you familiar with his music?"
76,That is very nice of you. I prefer someone who travels often like i do
76,"Not really, but I can spend the next few days doing some research"
76,"He's a great guy and makes awesome music if it fits your taste. I recommend ""on my level""."
76,where would you like to take them once you start dating?
77,do you wanna know my singer name?

77,sure
77,I call myself bubblegum because i have red hair 
77,"You know what, i have always secretly wanted to date red hair as a partner and I hope I will one day"

77,"preferably, Japan and Switzerland. "
77,I would love to go to Japan too
77,"Haha, that's a good one! I love humor."
78,that's really hard for me right now
78,"Indeed, the cat must of followed me during my jog session."
78,"Hah, that reminds me of Sylvester & Tweety. Cats are also valued for their companionship."
78,"Thanks. I think we would be a good match, we both like to run."
78,sometimes you just need to take a break and go find a peaceful place to sit and think.
78,"I know that, but whenever I get to thinking, I just can't figure out who I am"
78,"well, I used to run. now I just sit on the couch most of the time."
78,"Interesting, you can still run with those foot peddle machines if you like."
78,"some people never achieve that, don't get down on yourself."
78,"I used to know, but now I just feel lost and disconnected from everything"
78,"yes, good idea. I sometimes walk with my golden retriever dog."
78,That's how i felt when my dog died. maybe you could get a pet
78,My husband and I are afraid of the responsibility
78,that's true they are a lot of responsibility. maybe a snake?
78,What if I forget to feed it?
78,"Thanks, also, I meant foot ""pedal"". Also, that's very cool that you walk with your dog, its good for bonding."
78,snakes can go weeks without eating.
78,Then that might be the perfect pet for me. Is it true that they eat live rats?
78,I even use my Golden Retriever to go on hunting trips. He is able to retrieve shot down waterfowl like ducks.
78,"oh yes, snakes are better than cats against mice."
78,That's interesting. I guess the mind of dogs is more complex than we think.
79,"Indeed, the cat must of followed me during my jog session."
79,I mainly do it to reduce emissions.
79,"Hah, that reminds me of Sylvester & Tweety. Cats are also valued for their companionship."

87,"At least is good for the cold season!!  and talking abut healthy, do you exercise?"

98,I don't know how Christmas is gonna go with my family this year either... it's hard to be divorced when there's two kids mixed in.
98,Yeah.  This summer was so hot!!!!!!!!!  I am hoping for a chilly fall and frigid winter!!!
98,"Divorce is the WORST.  I, too, am divorced.  Worst experience of my life.  I don't speak to my ex."
98,I agree! I'm excited to see what winter brings into the area.
98,I'm sorry to hear that. It's very hard. I'm just ready to be done with the process.
98,It will get better over time.  Focus on your kids if you can.  It's gotta be rough.  Oh and get another partner!
98,I'm sure we are going to get pounded with snow.  Gotta watch out for the black ice!!!
99,Yes. I can't believe he would do this knowing what I'm going through with the divorce!
99,Corky is adorbs! His little tail! He loves to go to the mall!
99,"It's the most cute, it's so small"
99,They snore so much. I like having an excuse to shop at the mall and everyone loves him
99,"Do you have dogs? I have two, they love being in the yard"
99,"I have 2 as well, we have a backyard too. They must bring you joy!"
99,"Yeah, well, my big brother once hit me in the head with the claw end of a hammer."
99,"Yes, I did not have dogs when I was a kid, and now I love dogs."
99,"What a jerk! If I was there I could've helped you, since I'm in my second year of medical school."
99,"I grew up with them, I couldn't see my life without one"
99,"Ha-ha.  Yeah, no doubt.  I was just a kid and kind of indestructible.  We fought a lot."
99,I have a german shepherd and a pug. The always love to play. I am working on a painting of them.
99,That's very unfortunate. I hope my two kids never fight that way. Are you on good terms with your brother now?
99,Wow you paint? Those are great breeds.
99,We are great friends now.  I don't get to see him so much since I'm on tour with my band.
99,"Yes, I love to paint and also many other kinds of art. What about you?"
99,"I'm happy to hear that, I hope you get to seem him soon. Maybe he can come to see one of your shows."

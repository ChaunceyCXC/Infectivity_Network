1,and why is that?
1,"I think it's because in my head, I think everyone is judging me. I just start to sweat and I get sick in my stomach."
1,interesting but I know how you feel especially the whole people telling that it in your head 
1,"I don't really have people telling me in my head, more like behind my back"
1,Dang that's though. But I also understand that. I have people some who talks behind my back because of certain things that I believe in 
1,"Me too! What do you believe in? I believe in dragons... Just finished watching Game of Thrones. Man, those things are dope"
2,that's funny. No. I let him roam around the house.
2,What does your turtle eat?  Is it hard to take care of a turtle?
2,"He eats insects, leaves and sun flower seeds. It's easy. They don't need walking and cleanup is simple. Do you have any pets?"
2,"No, not at the moment.  I have 3 girls and they are enough trouble! LOL"
2,Congratulations. Do you come from a big family?
2,"I don't, just 2 siblings.  But my wife wanted a lot of kids. So, there you go."
2,Wow. cool. How often do you use computers?
2,I use a Mac for my work - I'm a music teacher.  I find it really helpful.  How about you?  Are you on the computer a lot?
2,Often. I use them at work for editing. I head about a way to stream videos or movies from the local library.
2,"Stream from the library - now, that sounds interesting. My wife and I do some scuba diving and want to begin filming underwater. Ever tried that?"
2,"No, but I have snorkled."
2,That's cool too. That's how we began.  Seen lots of Turtles!  LOL
3,Can't believe he grew up so quick
3,"Yeah, kids grow up so quickly "
3,What do you usually do when he visits?
3,"We will probably just spend most of the time here at home, no big plans really."
3,I understand. I think we will do the same. I hope he brings a few of his friends. I am not that old... if you know what I mean :)
3,You're only as old as you feel is what I say.
3,"Yes, that's exactly right! If you don't mind me asking, have you ever considered any of your son's friends? ^_^"
3,"Not really since I am usually spending my time alone in my studio painting, but I might give it some thought."
3,"You should. I am not really a blond, but I would say cute and the kids dig me. :) And you know, sometimes I let them play with me"
3,"Well everyone is an adult so who am I to judge, sounds like a good bit of fun to me."
3,"What are you up to now, girl?"
3,Just about to clean up my paints and and put them away for the day.
3,Well it was nice chatting with you. Have a good day
4,Canning is great for storing food. Sometimes I can food before my marathons to calm my anxiety.
4,"Wow, you've done a marathon?  I run a bit, but never tried anything long"
4,Yeah it's a great way to keep your heart healthy! I wish the marathons were in the evening though. Are you a morning or night person?
4,I'm totally a morning person.  I wake naturally around 6 a.m. And you?
4,"I wake up at 6 a.m.when I have work, sometimes I'll get up at 5 a.m. though for a morning run."
4,"So, how long and how far is your morning run?  And when you prepare for a marathon?"
4,"Generally I'll run about 3 miles, but when a marathon is coming up I'll build my way up to 5 or 7 miles every morning."
4,That's impressive.  I would like to try but I just don't have the stamina! Do you ever run with a dog?
4,"I don't have a dog, I just don't have the time to dedicate to a pet! Do you have any pets?"
4,"No pets, just a crowd of feral cats from the neighborhood that roam through the yard. Fun to watch."
4,"Oh that sounds funny, I like seeing cats roaming about the neighborhood. Cats are quiet creatures that really know how to take it easy!"
4,"We've had to step in a few times when one was injured, or a mama cat died. But they are timid creatures."
4,They really are timid. It's very special when a feral cat trusts you enough to approach you.
5,How would I start rock climbing?
5,I would suggest a fitness place with a rock wall.  Try that out in a safe environment
5,I will do that. I will take my mom with me since she is my best friend.
5,"It's good to have a spotter! Also, get in overall good shape with an emphasis on balance"
5,Where should be go after the fitnes place? Would the ocean be a good spot?
5,Ha ha - not for rock climbing.  Maybe you are thinking of diving?
5,I was thinking about diving. I would love to see some real life mermaids.
5,You may need to limit yourself to Disneyland for mermaids.  They're not actually real.
5,Thats not true. My mother told me they really exist.
5,I see.  I wonder where she has seen them?
5,She saw them when she was younger. I will believe my best friend since I know my mother well.
5,Far be it to argue with anyone's mother!  Do you have siblings?
6,I am excited. I just hope they can get through today then the rest of the week will be easy.
6,"I'm sure you'll do great. In second grade, that's where the kiddos will begin learning mathematics and science and social studies among other subjects"
6," I really don't know anyone around, but most of this neighborhood is young. What do you do for work?"
6,I work for a Mexican cartel that kidnaps 1st graders and sells them into slavery... ;) Just kidding
6,haaa. well no one works if they don't have to. I took a year off traveling last year.
6,I'm only kidding lol. I am a veterinarian. I love dogs and cats! Well and children too :)
6,"cool. the only dogs and cats I see are dead, embalmed and on display. Guess where I work?"
6,The morgue! ROFL
6,"haaa, a museum."
6,"That was my second guess :) but it was too late, I pressed the Send button"
6,It's amazing. but it's the only people I know here. recommend any restaurants?
6,"McDonald's? :) Just kidding... Well I don't even know where you live, but I'd say SoHo Sushi is my fave"
7,It's really great to have the memories.
7,What do your kids look back at the pictures you kept of theme over the years
7,Usually pictures of their families and their pets that they love so much.
7,"Pets are part of the family like humans, what typ of pets do you have if any"
7,I have one cat but I want to get another! Do you have any pets?
7,"I have 2 dogs, oreo and cupcake, they are goldendoodles"
7,"Wow, I've never heard of goldendoodles before. That's a bit hard to pronounce with my accent!"
7,"They are a cross of a poodle and golden retreiver, they make great family dogs, kids love them"
7,"That sounds so cute. My kitty could really use a friend, maybe I'll get a goldendoodle!"
7,Cats can be picky if you do get one get a puppy so they get along
7,"That's a smart idea, I want my kitty to feel at home. Do you like cats?"
7,"I do, I have a family member who has an adorable ragdoll cat name Max"
8,If Trump was a giant tree I would love cut it done.
8,"I get your feelings, but it's done and you must live with the consequences."
8,I dont think so. He always take the boots I love to wear too.
8,I have three pairs of boots.  How many do you have?
9,I have atleast twenty pairs. I really love to wear boots. I am a country person.
9,"i've tall boots , that rock whether i like country or not !"
9,Well do you also like eating meat. I am tough and love eating meat too.
9,"I do eat beef cuts like beef jerky and beef trimmings sometimes, but not very often."
10,Mine is green.
10,"Thats cool, most shades of green are named after plants."
10,Do you like this time of year? I like the change in seasons but not very fond of the cold weather that comes in winter
10,I like it. I wish the weather was a nicer. Winter lasts too long?
10,"Winter does feel like it can drag on, I just try to remember the next season is spring, I like spring the weather is great late spring"
10,Have you ever visited any other cities? I may go on a trip this winter.
10,"I have been to many cities around the world, try to avoid cities that have rainy seasons or get too cold in winter"
10,right. the rain can ruin a whole day if trying to explore a city.
10,"Yes some cities, get flooded like Venice in winter or get too cold like northern ctiies in Europe, America and Canada"
10,i know what you mean . flooding is not something i like to deal with .
10,It's a good way to get a cheap flight or hotel but it's not for me either
10,"yes, I use a few apps to check flights, but Priceline or Expedia still have the best deals."
11,"Ok that's interesting, how do you know about that?"
11,Hershey's is the pinnacle of chocolate and have been relevant for years and years.
11,"I don't eat much chocolate, I try to keep in shape for Cross Country"
11,Everything is good in moderation. I personally believe eating too much of something is the issue here.
11,"I agree, how much Hersheys do you eat?"
11,"Being from Georgia, I developed quite the sweet tooth in my younger days. However now I tend to have a Hershey's once in a while."
11,Sounds like you had a great childhood then!
11,You could say that. What was your childhood like?
11,"I can't really remember a lot, but I did play a lot of basketball with my friends"
11,I love basketball! I took part in many basketball tournaments and played in high school as well. What position do you play?
11,"I still practice basketball regularly, not a particular position thought"
11,That is awesome. My dream as a child was to play in the NBA.
12,Wow that is a lot. I've definitely seen plenty when I holiday at Lake Michigan
12,That is a nice place to holiday. Lake Michigan is so big!
12,Yeah it really is! Where do you go on holidays?
12,We like to explore around New England but our favorite holiday spot is in the Virgin Islands National Park.
12,"Oh cool, i've always wanted to go to the Virgin islands, I love seafood so think it would be a great place to try some"
12,I love seafood too! What are your favorite types of seafood?
12,lobster and shrimp definitely!
12,Yum! I LOVE shrimp so much.
12,How do you cook them?
12,I'm not a great cook. But I love to order shrimp dishes at restaurants. 
12,Yeah restaurants do them better than I ever could
12,Are there any other types of seafood that you like?
13,long time
13,It is impressive.
13,Thank you!
13,Do you take any mediciation?
13,I like the color purple
13,I love the color blue.
13,Blue is nice! What is your favorite animal?
13,My favorite animal is dog and some other animals as well.
13,I love dogs. We have one his name is Charlie.
13,that's amazing he's a family pet and a guard dog
13,Yes he is a Golden Retriever so he can bark loud
13,Mine only barks when he hears the UPS truck drive up.
14,Thank you! She's going to name him Cameron.
14,Do you have any other siblings besides your sister?
14,An older brother was well. What about yourself?
14,I do have a younger sister as well.
14,Nice! Are you an aunt or uncle yet?
14,Yes I am.
14,That's exciting! Do you have a niece or nephew?
14,"As a matter of fact, both!"
14,That's awesome. Any tips?
14,"the most i can say is , budget . i know it isn't much advice ."
14,Anything helps I appreciate it. Have you been keeping up with politics lately?
14,Yes I have kept up with politics and all the issues that are going on today.
15,"I am surprised how many reality tv shows are on air, what's your favorite type"
15,i like ones that aren't too scripted. there's one from japan called terrace house that is nice
15,"I like the outdoors type, the ones based in Alaska are interesting"
15,"i have seen cop shows based in alaska, there's a lot of socioeconomic issues up there"
15,I think like many reality shows they exaggerate how bad things are for ratings
15,"yeah, for sure. they make their own narrative to make a more interesting watching experience"
15,Some of the home improvement reality shows are interesting but they make their job look easier than it is
15,it looks easy when they can condense months of work into 30 minute - 1 hour episodes
15,"that's true, I wish they would show more of the work it takes to get a project started and completed"
15,i do understand that it makes for better watching to have a really drastic before and after shot without all the gritty work details
16,Really? That has been around for awhile then.
16,Yeah isn't that crazy. I love geysers. Have you ever seen one in person?
16,One time I was in a large group of people but couldn't get a very good look because of all the tall people in front of me.
16,Oh no! I am pretty tall so I don't have that problem. Except everyone looks at me funny in public.
16,"But, you can always grab things off the top shelf. That is a challenge for me!"
16,That's true. It has lots of advantages! Do you like hiking?
16,I do right now especially. The trees are all so pretty. I love the red leaves.
16,I love it when the leaves turn colors.
16,I would love to go to New England to see the leaves in the fall sometime. I hear it is very pretty. 
16,I went there once about 4 years ago in the fall. It's so beautiful!
16,Did you hike there?
16,I did yes! It was spectacular.
17,I do enjoy a good horror movie and then humor after.
17,I like to watch dark comedies like Barry on HBO starring Bill Hader. It's funny and has some dramatic parts to it.
17,He is very humorous and make good stand up points.
17,Yeah gotta love Bill Hader. Have you seen his series of mockumentaries called Documentary Now?
17,"No I have not, do you recommend to watch?"
17,"It's hilarious, just wish I had more time to watch his stuff"
17,Guess I will have to binge watch the series to get caught up with everything.
17,What are you fave shows to binge watch?
17,The Office and Breaking Bad!
17,Nice. The Office is one of my favorite shows. I do enjoy Steve Carrell's character.
17,I wish he did not leave the show after all those years.
17,Very true. I wonder what he will do next?
18,"lol i cant even do it with the quad kind, i just fall over anyway"
18,I fall from time to time as well
18,for some reason tho the time i went ice skating i was totally fine 
18,I prefer ice skating rings with rails just in case I fall I can grab on to something
18,if they don't have those you can always use your friends 
18,"Yes that's true, I just wouldn't want them to fall with me either"
18,"yea i feel that. tho i think when i was younger i wouldn't think of that at all, since falling over is not as big a deal lol"
18,"Yes, me and my friends took more risks when we were younger, not taking that chance now"
18,it would feel real bad to have to deal with a like serious injury over something as silly as that 
18,"Yes, even moving large furniture, I would rather have professionals move it than risk hurting my back"
18,"back injuries are really the worst, those will mess you up for life. even lighter stuff you can wrench it the wrong way and get messed up"
18,"That's why I stick to easier activities like skating instead of rock climbing, lol"
19,"No not at all, I have plenty of male friends"
19,I think that is a good thing.
19,"Yeah, although now you have me thinking about it, I don't think I am very comfortable about how much time he spends with her..."
19,I can see why that would bother you.
19,"haha yeah, so how about you, do you have a partner?"
19,Yes I do have a partner and I am comfortable with him having females friends.
19,That's great to hear. What's your favorite activity to do with him?
19,We both love riding motorcycles and playing put-put.
19,"Oh cool, i have played put-put a few times but I'm really bad at it"
19,"Well maybe you can become better at it, if it's something that you enjoyed"
19,Yeah I would like to try again
19,"you should give it a go , what do you do for work ?"
20,My coworker decided to pay for the lunch and I will repay once back at the office.
20,That was nice of him!
20,Next time I will make sure not to forget my wallet again.
20,I bet it was a pretty embarassing situation! I've forgotten my wallet before.
20,"Yes it was!, but it was a lesson learned  to not forget again."
20,Definitely. Where did you go to lunch?
20,Went to a nice sushi spot around down town.
20,I love sushi! We should go sometime!
20,That would be a good idea to meet up and enjoy some lovely sushi.
20,I am free on Saturday for dinner. I think there is a place downtown that has an all-you-can eat sushi option. Interested?
20,You talked me into it and I can not wait!
20,Let's do it. Meet at your place around 7?
21,it is harder some days than others. but it is good you get along with your mom so well
21,It is.  How was your relationship with your parents?
21,"it was good, this happened in my adult life so we all had work and stuff and maybe did not socialize as often as we could have"
21,I understand.  I guess I tend to socialize with my cat the most.  He is almost like family.
21,i think pets can be family for sure. just hanging out with them and petting them can be really calming
21,"Most definitely, except when he knocks stuff off of tables.  Do you have any pets?"
21,"i used to have a cat that was really bad about that, couldn't have anything on tables at all. but now i have a dog and a couple cats"
21,How does your dog get along with the cats?
21,they mostly just ignore each other. the cats are actually bigger than him so they never really seem worried about his presence
21,What kind of dog is it?
21,"a mix but mostly chihuahua, so he is tiny"
21,I heard Chihuhuas are evil.  Any truth to that?
21,"nooo, he is super sweet and lazy because he's an old man"
22,Haha I wish! My ex texted me the other day. She apparently still loves me.
22,"Huh, but why did you break up in the first place?"
22,We wanted different things in the future. She wanted kids and I didn't. Stuff like that.
22,Do you think either of you have changed your minds on that stuff?
22,I have. I think I want kids now.
22,Maybe you guys could try hanging out again before jumping back into dating. Did you stay friends after breaking up?
22,"Somewhat. We have both dated a couple other people, but we see each other at parties and stuff. Hanging out before dating is a good idea."
22,"I think it'd be fine if you guys tried angling towards dating again then, if you are also into it. Just don't feel pressured by her feelings!"
22,Maybe I'll ask her to go on a walk with me at a park this weekend. 
22,"That could be nice, it'd be a good chance to talk and get caught up."
22,"Definitely. And see if we are on the same page, possibly, for the future. No need to rush into things."
22,Definitely. Going from being exes to dating and definitely having kids would be way too fast.
22,"Indeed. Well, talk to you later!"
22,"Yep, see ya!"
23,Do you have a favorite game?
23,Yes I do and that is playing Sudoka.
23,Sudoka? Is that similar to sudoku?
23,"This one is the ultimate version of it, it is worth checking out"
23,I'll definitely check it out! Where do you play?
23,I just at home when I have the chance.
23,"Nice! Do you have a book of sudoka, or do you play on a computer?"
23,I do have several books that I like to play through.
23,Nice! I am heading to the mall in Chicago tomorrow. I will have to pick up a book!
23,"That sounds nice, I have never been to Chicago, but pics of the place seems so nice."
23,"It is a little too crowded for my tastes, but it is a decent place to live. "
23,I'm sure it is. Maybe I'll visit too
24,Interesting. I've never played billiards.
24,In the past the umbrella term was billiards
24,Is it similar to snooker?
24,I have never heard of this before.
24,I think snooker is another cue sport. Not sure how similar it is to billiards.
24,"That information is very interesting, will have to check that out."
24,Look up Ronnie O'Sullivan sometime. I've heard he is pretty good at snooker.
24,thanks i will have to look into it .
24,Have you ever played billiards?
24,No I have not? I think it might be fun though. Have you?
24,Not yet. Want to go play someday?
24,If I have spare time then maybe I will give it a try.
25,"i have to kick my cats out of bed, they never let me get any sleep"
25,ok good. cats can see in near darkness. I scared about dark so my pet is useful for me
25,that is good then. do they sleep with you all night?
25,yes i do . depending on them
25,what pets do you have?
25,I have just one and it is a good companion animal
25,it sounds like it does a good job. is it a cat?
25,"Yes, it is a cat that I rescued. "
25,"rescuing is good, i have never had a pet that wasn't rescued."
25,"It's good to have a pet in your life, makes you happy."
25,definitely. it is nice to take care of something and get attention sometimes
25,Yea pets are so cute and provide great emotional support
26,"Definitely! Hot dogs, brats, hamburgers, everything!"
26,That sounds like fun! What are you planning to do at the lake.
26,"Fish, hang out, play some games, swim, and relax"
26,I like going out to the lake to watch the water and other folks enjoying themselves.
26,"It is going to be a blast! I have to remember to bring my fishing pole, though. I forgot it the last time."
26,Do you catch any fish out at the lake?
26,Lots of bass and northern. Loads of fun. Do you fish?
26,"No! I have never fished, but would love to someday."
26,You should come out to the lake with my family! 
26,I would love to if I have the time.
26,"My family owns the lake, so we could go up whenever you're free"
26,Oh that is so awesome!!
27,Yes! Time especially goes by fast when I'm working at my job. I'm constantly busy.
27,"So true! We just had a baby, and work just flies by! I usually can't wait to get back home."
27,I understand that. I have a 5 year old so I'm anxious to get back home and enjoy time with him.
27,Do you just have the one kid? This is my first.
27,"Yes, I just have one kid. I'm hoping to start trying for another within the next year or two. "
27,My wife want to start trying now. Seems like so much is happening quickly.
27,Oh that's exciting! How many more do you all want? I want just 1 more. I'd love to have a girl this time.
27,"We want to have at least 6 kids. We are from Italy, and we love having big families!"
27,"Oh, that is awesome! Do you and your wife come from a big family?"
27,"My wife does, I am an only child. My mom is in the medical field and did not really have time for kids."
27,I'm an only child as well. I wish that I had siblings growing up but it did allow me special moments with my parents.
27,"I do not see my mom much, but I have a great relationship with my dad."
28,How about earphones?
28,I like to have a deep bass with my earphones. Beats are my favorite brand. 
28,I do agree about that!
28,Have you ever used a set of wireless Beats?
28,"No! I have not, but I do find it very interesting."
28,Yeah they are nice. They are perfect to help me get into the zone while I am out mountain biking! What kind of music do you like?
28,I like of type of genres that gets me through a rigid work out as well.
28,My favorite is heavy metal but I will listen to anything. What is your favorite music genre?
28,Definitely anything from the 80's.
28,Yeah. You like the hair bands like Poison?
28,"Poison, Micheal Jackson, Metallic, you name it."
28,Nice. Metallica is one of those ageless bands. They bring together many generations of rockers!
29,What other games do you like?
29,I love the new mario kart! It is so much fun.
29,My dad has this program that has all kinds of games from when he was a kid.Ever heard of pong or donkey kong?
30,Same here. I tend to buy in bulk.
30,oh wow do you like to visit thrift shops ?
30,I love to visit thrift stores. 
30,awesome i like thrift stores too you can find some great items there .
30,Definitely! I once found a signed jacob sartorius record.
30,That is amazing. I would love to have something like that in my collection. Any idea what the value is for it?
30,Probably at least a couple hundred. 
30,"man , you have got an all around good deal !"
30,I know! Have you ever found any worth a lot of money at a thrift store?
30,I have found some furniture for my friend's apartment. It was a great deal to come across. 
30,Nice! Vintage furniture is the best!
30,The old ones are always better aren't they??
30,"Of course. Way more solid than Ikea stuff, usually."
31,i am alone but i'm not lonely.i have a dog who's great company.
31,What kind of dog do you have?
31,"It's an attack chihuahua.It'll attack anything- shoes,socks,laundry, anything that fight back.LOL"
31,I am not a fan of chihuahuas. I prefer labs or german shepherds.
31,I meant to say anything that won't fight back.big dogs are cool but they need a lot of exercise and they eat a lot. 
31,"Very true. I run a lot, so I think I could handle a big dog. "
31,yeah.take him running with you.how much do you run and how far usually?
31,Every day. Anywhere from 3 miles to 20 miles. And the occassional marathon
31,i very much respect that.i've got bad knees.i can't run  but i walk 30-60  minutes every day 
31,"Walking is good exercise. I get shin splints often, so running hurts. I walk often too."
31,shin splints .oh that's bad.i used to get them occasionally years ago when i ran.
31,"Yeah, they are rough. Usually I try to just run through them. Some days they are so bad I can barely walk."
32,I'm a thrill seaker. Do you like extreme sports?
32,I usually don't. But this one was very impressive.
32,What do you like most about it?
32,I really like just being able to escape to a different world.
32,"Yeah, like everything fades away. Do you ever watch the olympics?"
32,"I usually don't, but I do enjoy watching it during the summer Olympics!"
32,What is your favorite olympic sport?
32,I like swimming. What's yours?
32,"Summer sport would be skateboarding, and winter would be ice cross. "
32,That's cool. What got you into watching sports?
32,"Acess to the tv, lol. Just kidding. I love to participate so watching was a way to learn more about the sports I like. What about you."
32,"Mostly just lack of anything else to do around here, and all my friends were into sports at the time"
33,Yes early detection improves the odds to beating it. 
33,The symptoms shown by my mom was a chronic fever for more than 10 days

33,Interesting. How long ago did she have the surgery?
33,For more than six months.
33,She hasn't had any re-occurence of the cancer?
33,"Not yet any re-occurence of the cancer cells, though I'm single and not looking, I'm taking care of her."

34,"My son dressed up as a storm trooper, and my daughers as Ewoks"
34,"That is adorable. Did you dress up as well, or just chaperone? "
34,"I put on a flannel shirt, jeans, and some suspenders, and carried around a fake axe. A lumberjack."

35,How old are they?
35,4 years old.they're brothers from the same litter. do you have any pets?
35,"Yes, I have a pet rattlesnake named Monte. "
36,"He is so good at playing the piano, I have been playing myself for three years."
36,Did you find it hard to learn the piano?
36,"No, It was fairly easy learning how to play, however I did have to practice a lot."
36,"Did you decide to learn it on your own, or did you get lessons?"
36,I learned on my own by just watching youtube videos of other people playing. 
36,It's awesome that we live in an age where you can learn just about anything from Youtube
36,"It really is, have you ever played the piano?"
36,Not at length. I have tried an electric keyboard and a regular piano before.
36,Did you like playing them?
36,"The keyboard was fun with all the different sound fonts. The piano was fine, but could definitely feel I didn't know what I was doing."
36,Have you played any other instruments? 
36,I took drum lessons at one point but they never really went anywhere.
37,Wow! I would love to have the space to adopt some kids of my own.
37,Do you have kids of  your own?
37,I don't we are waiting to pay off the house before we have kids. What about you?
37,We have two boys.
37,Are they still children or are they grown?
37,"They are my wife's children from her previous marriage. The eldest is disabled, and my wife cares for him. The younger is in high school."
37,I can't immagine how hard it would be to take care of a disabled child. Do you help out a lot?
37,"It is hard. I do what I can, but I am out of town on work a lot. The child attends a day program and has visiting nurses."
37,"Wow, that is a lot of care. What do you do for a living that takes you out of town so much?"
37,I'm out on the oil rigs. Where do you work?
38,My phone died and I could not find the charger for my phone so I wanted to get a newspaper.
38,So you normally view the newspaper on your phone?
38,I usually do it is just the most convenient place for me to get caught up with the news.
38,I prefer to read a newspaper. I guess I am old school like that. 
38,Why do you like getting news from a newspaper more?
38,I find it easier to read words printed in ink. Plus I can clean windows with the newspaper when I am done reading it!
38,Yeah sometimes my eyes start to hurt after looking at a screen too long.
38,Yeah. Do you ever use the blue light filter feature on your devices? 
38,No what is that?
38,It filters out blue light from your electronic devices. This keeps your eyes from straining while viewing your device. 
38,I will definitely look into that because I work a lot on my computer.
38,I know Galaxy phones have the feature built in and it works great!
39,i ride in my spare time as much as i can.
39,cool ! do you find much time for riding ?
39,i make time.i plan ahead.that's what you do when something's important to you. 
39,i agree. It's also hard to make time for hobbies.
39,what are your main hobbies?what do you most enjoy?
39,Recently I have been playing the piano. I try to practise whenever I got time free from college
39,"far more than the piano,i love the harpsichord.i hate that it fell out of style"
39,I have never heard of a harpsichord. Is it similar to a piano?
39,"it was the predecessor to the piano.it looks quite similar but sounds much different.next time you're on youtube,type it in and give it a listen"
39,I definitely will. I love learning about the history of musical instruments. Do you play an instrument?
39,i play guitar and i have fooled around a little bit on the piano.how long have you been playing piano?
39,"I started a few weeks ago. I'm a slow learner, but it's fun. "
40,Yeah I served twenty years in the navy.
40,Thank you for your service! What was your rating?
40,I was a warrant officer CW03.
40,That's cool. When did you retire from the Navy?
40,I retired in 2011 it is weird being retired but I do enjoy it.
40,I bet. Do you ever miss serving?
40,"Not really, I do miss all the friends that I made throughout my time in the navy."
40,Yeah. Do you stay in contact with any of your old Navy buddies?
40,Yes I still talk to seven of the guys that were in my company.
41,Have you ever ran a mile?
41,Yeah i usually run about 3 miles every day. 
41,I try to run a good bit as well but I do it every other day.
41,That is good. I usually try to run in the mornings to help clear my head for the day. 
41,I always go in the evening or at night I am not a morning person.
41,I have always been a morning person. I enjoy the fresh crisp morning air!
41,I tend to have trouble sleeping so I never have been one.
41,That is tough. Have you ever talked to a doctor about your trouble sleeping?
41,"No, I do not go to the doctor for any thing really they are expensive."
41,Yes without insurance they can be extremely expensive. 
41,Do you run competitively? 
41,No I only do it to help stay in shape and to keep my mind clear. 
42,I am more nervous about losing my hear
42,"I also have some toothache right now, dental pain, and I am afraid to go. lol"
42,Hmm... you sound like a bot... Are you? Please be honest
42, a coward is what i am when anyone says dentist
42,"Alright, you are bot, you just won't admit. But OK, that's fine, I am game. Wadda-u-do for life?"
42,what i'd like to do is perform.make it as a musician.been studying music since i was a kid
42,You realize you haven't answered a single question I've asked?...
42,you asked me what do i do for life.i told you what i'd like to do.what do you do or wish you were doing?
42,I hate talking to you. Ima freakin' chef. What do you do? (not wish to do)
42,you're a chef.i'm a waiter.
42,that wasn't that hard was it? Now I like you more :)
42,"you have the better ,more respected job.everyone loves the chef.everyone hates the waiter, judging by the tips i get"
43,I do not drink coffee much.
43,I can drink coffee all day long. Even on days that are hot!
43,"I have never felt the supposed energy boost that it gives people, have you?"
43,No. I use caffeine so much it just makes me feel normal. 
43,Did you used to feel it?
43,Maybe when I was younger. I have been a chronic cappuccino consumer for decades now. 
43,Are cappuccinos expensive?
43,Not really. They average about $4.00 per large serving. 
43,What is your favorite brand?
43,I love Starbucks and not just because I work there!
43,I have been there one time I got a Mocha!
43,Those are pretty good! You should get one with a triple shot!
44,always. this city is not gonna build it self 
44,Don't you have something better to do with your time? Those meetings must be boring
44,i enjoy being active on the council. but when i do get away from meetings i  spend free time checking on my alpacas
44,What the hell is alpacas? Did you make it up?
44,"its an animal, that i keep on my ranch. have 10 of them in total. why would i make this up"
45,We all have a test tomorrow and they hadn't studied enough.
45,That's such a bummer! They could have studied at your birthday dinner...
45,"Yes, we all could have studied together, that would have been more fun than them canceling."
45,wish i could go . . . i've a test tomorrow to study for too...
45,That's nice of you to say. :)
45,Maybe we could get together and celebrate. I don't have a boyfriend so I'm always available ;-)
45,That would be fun. Not sure where I want to go tho.
45,"Well, it being your birthday and autumn, how about I treat you to a pumpkin spice latte at the local cafe while we study?"
45,Sounds great! I need to go back to the dorm and get my books tho.
45,My favorite season is spring so I wear spring wardrobe much too late in the year so I'm underdressed and need to go to my dorm to get a jacket.
45,Ok well let's head that way first. I love this weather!
45,"I do love the autumn colors and comfy sweaters, and of course pumpkin spice lattes! Should we meet there in say, 30 minutes?"
46,What do you do for work?
46,I work with children!
46,Really? Me too! 
46,yeah. .i like kids but they never run out of energy. that's where it gets challenging 
46,That's definitely true! They can be a handful but they're pretty hilarious
46,oh boy. they are. some of that could really make one's day 
46,Any big plans for your weekend?
46,I haven't planned anything yet. What about you? 
46,It's my partner's birthday so I think we'll end up going to dinner! Should be fun!
46,sounds like fun ! where are you going out to ?  might catch a new movie that's out
46,"Sounds good! I've heard the new Korean Thriller, Parasite, is quite good"
46,i might have to check that out . is it a comedy ?
47,I need to learn as much as I can about horses because I want my  own stable.
47,They are so graceful and powerful. I would love to have horses.
47,They are beautiful animals I have ridden horses my whole life.
47,Have you thought about becoming a veterinarian?
47,Yes I have I would like to go to school and become one.
47,You should totally be an equine veterinarian and work with horses every day
47,I would love to do that for a living.
47,"horses are so cool. My parents are doctors, it's a good life whether for people or for animals"
47,Do you want to become a doctor?
47,Not sure if I could live up to the standard of my parents. 
47,What do you want to do for work?
47,I'm more interested in the arts and theater.
48,Its okay. That tragedy occurred 20 years ago. 
48,That is so sad to hear. It is good that you know what your father loved though! Do you know much about your mother?
48,Yes. She was a 4th grade teacher that loved art and cooking! She made the best meatloaf ever!
48,How awesome! My father loved to cook for my family as well when he was home from deployment.
48,What is your favorite thing he made for you?
48,He made the absolute best chicken parmesan! 
48,Ohh I love me some chicken parme Reminds me of that Peyton Manning commercial!
48,Yes! I am actually currently analyzing that commercial for my television production class! Its the last class I need before receiving my Bachelors degree.
48,That is great! I have a BA in IT that I received last year. 
48,"Awesome!  I bet that's a really versatile degree, you should be really successful!"
48,Yeah. What career are you hoping to have upon completion of your degree?
48,Im hoping to work in film production. I would like to become a director!
49,Wow my favorite band is Metallica and they are still performing too 
49,Awesome!  So glad they're still rocking after all these years!
49,"Me too, i grew up listening to them. "
49,"Do you have a favorite Metallica album? Mine is Master of Puppets, even though that's kind of cliche to say! third time is a charm! (Its their third album) haha."
49,I love that one but my favorite has to be ride the lightning.
50,Was it as popular as it is now?
50,"Actually not! It used to be called ""makerouns"" though I""m not sure why."
50,That's funny...maybe it was the type of cheese that they used.
50,I read that it was made with fresh hand-cut pasta and then slathered with butter and cheese. So it sounds exactly like what we make today!
50,Do you know what kind of cheese they used? Like usually we use cheddar now.
50,"I don't, but whatever it was I bet it was delicious. Imagine how it was just from the same cow"
50,"Back then they could of made it with goat milk, but whatever animal they milked it was definitely fresh? And the pasta...I love fresh pasta."
50,Yeah! And pasta dates back to the 4th century B.C.!
50,Have you ever made fresh macaroni and cheese?
50,"I haven't, but maybe I'll give it a try!"
50,It's much better then the boxed stuff...it's not too hard either. 
50,How long does it take?
51,yeah. anything interesting? 
51,it was a lot of school but i like it . hope my daughter does follows .
51,yeah. there's a lot of good advice in her actual teachings. ive learnt to be way more patient 
51,I work 60 hours a week so it's hard to find time to do the montessori lifestyle
51,whoa. it does take a lot. well me and my wife are a team . our daughter needs us. i hope you can find someone to help out 
51,We definitely have a lazy lifestyle at home since I just like to relax after work. Sometimes I think i should get out and exercise more.
51,well i do make time to go outdoors with my kids. so that's where i get in some physical activity
51,I used to love the outdoors before I became a CEO and now the most outdoors I get is walking from my corvette to the office building.
51,its really hard to keep up a schedule. but hey i tend to feel better when i eat better. do you watch your diet?
51,I try to eat at higher quality restaurants but being on the road for business doesn't always allow that. I stay at hotels and order out a lot.
51, when do you go on the road again
51,I go on the road when I have to check on other franchises for my company.
52,That's all important. He's okay. Who else do you like?
52,Jay-Z
52,Tbh I think his wife is a better rapper than he is ;)
52,lol
52,You don't think so?
52,"I don't consider her a rapper, she's an okay rapper for a singer."
52,Why isn't she a rapper?
52,Because she is a singer. She doesn't make rap songs.
52,But rap songs were on her last couple of albums.
52,"Ok, so give me an example of why you think she is a better rapper than Jay-Z..."
52,Her flow and delivery are much better.
52,"Well, we both know who wrote it anyway."
52,That's sexist.
52,If you actually look at the credits on her album you will clearly see his name.
53,I'm really sorry to hear that. Losing two family members in such a short timespan is really heartbreaking. 
53,its really heart breaking. i'm so glad to have made good memories. it would be tragic if i had regrets
53,I completely agree. It makes you realize how important it is to spend time with people while they are here.
53,"Absolutely, it's a chapter of your life and as long as you have those memories they live on through those memories."
53,That is a really good way of looking at it. And you can share those memories with new people in your life and breathe life into them.
53,You are so right. It can make all the difference.
53,Do you have other family members to help you after your loss?
53,yeah we have a large close knit family. how bout you?
53,"We keep in touch, but all my immediate family lives rather far. So it is just me and my dogs at home."
53,so how do you feel about cancer...
53,"It is really hard to watch people go through it, whether they decide to get treatment or just accept it."
53,same here . i just know a lot of people that actually is going through it .
54,Not that I wanted to take... maybe I'll just take the semester off...
54,"No, that may throw you off by a whole semester!  I would be really mad if I were you!"
54,"I have a secret. Being born in Baton Rouge, I've always wanted to be a street performer in New Orleans!"
54,That sounds like so much fun. How long have you been performing?
54,I never have but I've had an idea to be a pirate performer. That would be appropriate in New Orleans since it's off the coast. 
54,I love New Orleans. I bet you'd fit right in!
54,"I practice my act with my parrot named Parrot. I'm Polly Pirate so she asks me if ""Polly want a cracker?"" It's a comedy act."
54,Sounds like you have some real talent there.  Keep up the good work.  I bet you'll be famous one day!
54,I guess all my classes that I wanted to take being full is a true sign! Maybe I'll even take this to America's Got Talent one day! 
54,"You're right, perhaps it's divine intervention!"
54,Is there any other sort of intervention in life that puts you on the right track in life?!
54,Not without a lot of help!
55,Just decided to watch the Saints game
55,sounds great ! my friends and i are heading out for lunch later !
55,"That's cool, what's the plan."
55,well there's a new restaurant that we'd like to try out. they have a wine bar
55,What's the menu look like?
55,authentic american cuisine.. we're pretty much going for the bar and wine selection
55,Do they ever have a wine tasting?
55,"not sure , there may be many during the week. seeing that they're new in town "
55,Sounds like something my wife would drag me to.
55,that might be a good idea ! you should take her out to dinner too. dont wait on her to drag you
55,Maybe for our anniversary.
55,well i'll have to let you know if that restaurant is a go!
56,anything i do i try to do great at it. i'd say i gave it my best. i was satisfied 
56,"I understand, but at least you were prepared and you feel accomplished."
56,you dont get nervous to speak infront of crowds?
56,"Extremely nervous, actually. But I haven't had that big of an issue since my speech course in college. Lucky for me I passed."
56,there is a course for anything isnt there
56,Honestly yes. You didn't take a recommended speech course in college? I swear it was mandatory
56,i didnt take it that seriously. honestly hate speeches
56,"I get that. Even though it was mandatory, I'm glad I took it since I obviously needed it due to me running for political office back in 2004"
56,well you see. i know i would never go for a career where i would have to be that out there. its good that its mandatory though
56,Yeah that's why I went to school for computer hardware in case the political thing flopped. I build my own computers and run my own store now
56,so you had no success in politics?
56,"Oh but I did, I'm actually the Vice President of this made up country"
56,lmao 
56,"It's called Ligma, I make like 800k a week"
57,It's amazing how a little kindness from strangers can go such a long way.
57,"He thought I was cute and old fashioned since I wore a locket. I still love to line dry my clothes! Nothing better, I say!"
57,I agree with you! The way linens smell after being air dried is way better than any dryer sheet
57,"A word of advice, always hang your clothes higher than your goats can reach! I learned that early on living on a homestead! Explains the missing socks!"
57,Oh wow yeah! I never thought about that. I don't raise animals but my neighbor does. I do like to hunt deer from time to time.
57,"We've had so many animals but their all for slaughter or use on the farm, chickens for eggs, goats for milk, ya know.... we hunt a lot as well."
57,"That's great. I love animals, but I also love the thrill of the hunt. I use a bow to make it more interesting."
57,"Wow! A bow! You're a true hunter! Ya know, all these animals I've owned but I've never had a true indoor pet?"
57,"Really? Man, pets are great too. I am lost without my dog."
57,I'll one day own a ferret. I've been selling our extra eggs at the market to save up for one!
57,Keep at it! Ferrets are cute little things. Where would you put it?
57,I'd cage it at night but take it with me during the day. Ferrets are canines so you can train them like dogs.
58,led zepelin. they are legendary

59,"Oh yes I do. I'm like Chip Skylark. And my girlfriend is a famous Youtuber, you might of heard of her?"

61,i havent had a bad day yet
62,"Yes, finally. Do you enjoy long drives?"
62,Yes they are great. I love just getting in the car and stoppingonly when I am in another place.
62,I agree. One time I drove for 10 hours in one direction and had no idea where I was going
62,Was this before GPS or did you just leave it off
62,I turned the GPS off and just drove and drove. Thats how I found the house I am moving too
62,Wow what a nice coincidence!
62,I always look for mountains and snow when I am going somewhere new so that I can use my snowboard
62,That sounds like a lot of fun! Which mountains?
62,The rockies are my favorite but I love them all! What are your hobbies
62,"I like movies, especially emotional ones."
62,Emotional like sad or happy?
62,"It depends, but usually sappy"
63,"i work as a personal trainer , 5 days a week so i had enough strength to pull myself out of the window before the engine exploded."
63,Wow! That is amazing! You are so lucky. I am not that strong. It must have been scary.
63,"I live n Las Vegas, Nevada so I was bound to encounter a drunk driver one day. I thank God for saving my life that night."
63,"Yes, God is good! I have never been to Vegas. How long have you lived there?"
63,My whole life. Born and raised! I'm thankful I found Jesus before I found out about the sins of Sin City.
63,"Ha! So true! I am from Tennessee, the Bible Belt. We sure know Jesus!"
63,"I love tennessee! I have property in the small town of 5000, Ashland City that I visit often. Gets me away from the city."
63,That is awesome! Where is Ashland City? 
63,About 40 minutes west of Nashville. They have a wildlife refuge area which is where my property is. It's like being in a backwards zoo!
63,Is that by the Elephant sanctuary? 
63,I haven't heard of an Elephant sanctuary around there but if so I would love to visit! They are a favorite animal!
63,"Yes, there is one by Nashville. I believe it is only 1 of 2 in the United States. That is so neat that you live by a wildlife refuge"
63,"I'm seriously going to check this out now, thank you so much!!!"
63,"Yes, you need to check it out. I follow them online. It was nice talking to you. "
63,Already on their website! Nice talking to you too!
64,Wow. is there repercussions 
64,"Yes, if a whistleblower tells, the company can get in trouble. They can get big fines for exploitation of workers."
64,Thats terrible have you ever witnessed this personally
64,"No, I own a small business. I can only afford to pay my workers minimum wage, but I treat them well. I have heard stories about horrible working conditions."
64,I work night shift at a hotel. I hate my job
64,I am so sorry to hear that. Why do you hate your job?
64,I dont enjoy working nights. I would rather work during the day
64,"Yes, that is hard to work the night shift. Is there a reason your boss won't let you work days?"
64,There is no openings and I was the last to start
64,"Yes, that is usually how it works. Are there any other hotels hiring for a day shift near you?"
64,Im not sure I have not been looking. I would prefer to do something involving snow if possible
64,What kind of work involving snow? You have peaked my curiosity.
65,"No, I work with chemicals. Did you always want to be an engineer?"
65,Yes I have wanted to be an engineer for many years.
65,Likewise. My parents were scientist and it inspired me to follow in that field. Why are you in this field?
65,I want to innovate for future generations.
65,Very nice. Any ideas so far?
65,"Yeah, we need to reduce emissions right now."
65,I agree. Currently at my workplace we have a team working on reducing emissions. Are you currently working anywhere?
65,"Yes, I work in a medium sized firm in Portland. Where are you from?"
65,I currently reside in a small town near Illinois. Have you ever been to Illinois?
65,"Yes, I have a few times, but not recently. Do you live alone, or with family?"
65,I currently live alone. Do you live in the city?
65,"No, I live just out the city in a small house. I prefer the peace and quiet. What about you?"
66,Netflix original shows are the best in my opinon 
66,I do like the Netflix originals. I also love the British shows as I am from London. You will love Netflix. There are so many choices!
66,Me and my family all really enjoy Netflix!
66,Do you have children?
66,4 boys and 2 girls. I have a huge family!
66,Wow! That is wonderful! They will get so much use out of Netflix. The selection for kids is terrific.
66,We have watched every show on there I think!
66,I can believe it. It is quite addictive. We have binged quite a few shows. Do you have a favorite show?
66,Bojack horeseman yours?
66,"I haven't tried that one, but I heard it is great. I think I it is a toss up between, ""Making a Murderer"" and  ""The Crown""."
66,What are the generes of those shows?
66,"""Making a Murderer"" is a documentary. ""The Crown"" is a drama based on the queen. "
67,It definitely is. What do you like to do?
67,I enjoy training to rock climb
67,Me too! It gives great upper-body strength
67,i bet that it does . it takes a lot of coordination .
68,i speak english only
68,"Oh ok, where is your family from?"
69,Does your mom get scared?
69,Not really! It's mostly myself who gets scared.
69,Im not a big fan of heights myselg!
69,"My sister is the opposite of you. She has a passion for heights - she could dance along a cliff edge, it wouldn't bother her a bit."
69,Wow that sounds awful to me! I would much rather be in a casino lol
69,Yeah I don't have the best luck in casinos either.
69,I still like to gamble though
69,"One time I went on a casino cruise and met a mermaid. Now I know for sure, they are real. I believe."
69,I have never seen one in real life 
69,That's because they're real.
69,Well I guess that makes sense
69,There are a lot of misconceptions about them but they're definitely real. I'll never forget that night.
70,Oh ok well I hope to see you later for karate
70,I can't wait!
70,Me either. What belt do you have?
70,White belt. I've just started.
70,Well you need to start somewhere! I've been doing it for years now
71,I am 22. I also love science
71,"I love eating barbeque sandwiches. We served them at my birthday party, along with pizza puffs. I love science too, but not as much as pizza puffs."
71,I am a scientist for a living
71,i am 19 and still in school. Scientist sounds interesting!
71,It is the best. That and the beatles haha!
71,oh yes the beatles are the best of the best. but are they better than barbeque sandwiches? 
71,Oh yeah
71,too bad the beatles are not around anymore. Sometimes I like to imagine John Lennon is right here with me.
71,He is in spirit
71,"Yes, he was the best musician ever."
71,They all were great
71,Absolutely. How about Paul McCartney's Christmas time classic?
72,"I have trouble remembering, I just think about how they taste"
72,"Yeah, it's hard remembering anything if you're like myself, working the same job for 8 whole years. "
72,Oh wow that't a long time to be in one job! What do you do?
72,"I work in marketing. It's kinda cut throat sometimes. When I get home, I put some rolling stones on and it all melts away."
72,Mmm what a way to relax!
72,It certainly does put me in a good emotional state. They're my favorite band after all.
72,"Cool, I prefer opera myself, there's just something about it that soothes me"
72,"Honestly, opera can be so cool."
72,"I'm glad you think so, most people just don't appreciate it at all"
72,Most people don't appreciate anything worthwhile.
72,Haha so true. It can be hard to find common ground
72,I'm with you there for sure .
73,Thanks for your support! Hopefully I will make it as an actor!
73,"You're welcome. Well, an actor in the background is still a very important actor. Maybe you'll be in a lead role someday!"
73,"Thanks, you're right! How about you? What do you want to do?"
73,Make more money! It totally blows working at scrubway. 
73,I can imagine. What do you think you would be good at?
73,"Not too sure, but I never want to disappoint my family. That's why I'm in college for engineering."
73,"Nice, well engineering can definitely get you a high paying job"
73,"It totally can. Anyway enough about me, you got any cool hobbies?"
73,"Theatre pretty much consumes my life at the moment, but I love it"
73,Any favorite actors?
73,Can I say myself? Haha
73,Of course! But who is #2?
74,"Nah, we never could afford the fancy things. Best I had was out of a can!"
74,"Well, you get experience points on that. Hopefully, the next dish is better."
74,I'm sure it would be if I could find a way to heat it up! Usually that makes it better.
74,"You ate the dish cold?! That sounds vile, it really needs to be hot."
74,Yeah I did. But I was on my boat fishing at the time. I was in the middle of the lake and got hungry. That can was all I had.
74,I suppose if you're starving you wouldn't really care if its hot or cold. Why didn't you eat one of the fish that you caught?
74,Hadn't caught any yet. Plus they are hard to cook on a little boat. Do you eat raw fish?
74,"Yes I suppose it would be hard to cook. I've had sushi which is raw, is it not?"
74,"Yeah, but I'm sure that didn't include the head did it?"
74,"Don't think it did, what is wrong with eating the head?"
74,Not much if that's your thing. Never had the desire to try that myself!
74,"I really like sushi, but I know a lot of people that aren't a fan. You could try vegetarian sushi which doesn't contain fish"
75,I gave the cash I had to a homeless guy by the art gallery.
75,is he still there maybe? hope so. Remember the movie Groundhog Day. It was the homeless guys last day
75,I don't watch much TV. I spend most days painting. 
75,"TV is good to fall asleep to, i've wanted to start painting but being a nurse keeps me busy"
75,"How do you handle being a nurse, working with so many people? I get so nervous around people."
75,I like being busy and helping people is fun.
75,I guess I'll always be a shy person. I doubt that my date calls me back. I think you were right.
75,Are you going to call your data back?
76,I do
76,"That's excellent, what's your favorite, I have tons of favorites."
76,Probably Nike tennis shoes.
76,"I love nike designs, their footwear is some of the most comfortable and stylish stuff I've ever worn."
76,Indeed it is. The children at the school I teach at always love to see my new shoes.
76,"That's good. Speaking of good, do you like discovering new restaurants to eat at? "
76,mhm. I always try out a new restraunt once a month after work.
76,I enjoy dining out as well . what is your favorite restaurant so far?
76,El Chico is my favorite restraunt.
76,I love eating there as well. The food is always amazing and always up to quality.
77,"Awesome! I was so close to there when I was hiking one day, but I had to return home for it was getting dark."
77,"Haha, I don't like walking in the dark either."
77,"Indeed, speaking of dark, what type of chocolate do you prefer most? I prefer vegan 100 percent cocoa."
77,I like Almond milk chocolate.  I'm glad chocolate has health benefits as well.
77,"Me too! It contains so many antibiotics, no wonder it was used in medicine many years ago, and today as well."
77,"Chocolate is not just good for the body, but for the soul as well."
77,"Very true, the ancients used it very often as a treat. Also, I think I meant antioxidants, not antibiotics... "
77,no worries; I knew what you meant.
77,Thanks! I'm glad there's someone whom understands chocolate and me!
77,"Since you like it so much, you should visit Chocolate World if you get the chance. There are shops and restaurants there too."
77,"Cool, thanks! Perhaps I could hike there someday soon during the spring time."
77,Yeah you should go there!
78,They're 6 and 9
78,That is so neat. Are they at the age that they like the Australian Band Hi-5? My kids love to binge watch their show!
78,Yes they absolutely love it!! They watch it on their tablets in the car!
78,That is so awesome. I hope it gets there before this weekend so you can binge it!
78,Oh absolutely! It's amazing.
78,My 5-year-old twins love it!
78,Oh I bet they do! Are they boys or girls?! What are there names?
78,A boy and a girl. Thomas and Abigale.
78,oh that's adorable. Are they well behaved?
78,They are most of the time; Thomas always seems to get into trouble when he comes with me to feed the horses.
78,"Horses are exciting though, can you blame them?! Mine are just the same."
78,Nope; can't blame them at all. Especially since my horses are very patient and good with kids.
79,"Thank's for the info, it would be cool if they make a super kayak with a roof, and motor power."
79,it could be like a self paddling pod boat with elaborate comforts . .
79,"Indeed, and it would sure save on flight and automobile traffic, if more could use the oceans and lakes for travel."
79,"wouldn't the exhaust fumes pollute more rivers and the ocean, it isn't really helping with cutting down on pollution created by combustion engines."
79,"True and good point, however, if the engine can run off of solar, and water currents, then there would be less pollution."
79,I also know they have another way of storing power by use of pressurized fluid that's in hydraulic hybrids. They are also coming up with newer technologies.
79,"That's very interesting, thanks. Imagine what the world could look like 10 years from now, phones under our skin, maybe. "
80,"Indeed, but more nervous. Ironic for I teach yoga..."
80,"Hey, I bet that's an interesting job. I actually have never done yoga! I keeping meaning to, but sometimes I hear voices telling me that it's a bad idea!"
80,"Thanks, I teach yoga on weekdays, I work at the red cross other days. I hope this date day goes well."
80,I've got my fingers crossed for you! Where are you going?
80,"Thanks, I'm going to the gym where I used to do yoga a few times a week. I turned it into a living by recording my yoga and teaching."
80,Sounds awesome! We have a fitness center locally that offers tanning beds and massages.  i was thinking of joining just for that.
80,"That sounds great, I would love too. Also, talking to you has made me less nervous. Thanks."
80,definitely ! it was nice chatting with you too !
80,"Thanks, I'm almost getting ready to go now. I'm looking forward to that meeting you offered!"
80,Yes I am looking forward to the meeting too! What are you going to wear to your date?!
80,"Just casual pants and a shirt, I don't want to feel too awkward too soon."
80,Yes good idea!
81,That's cool! What was the heaviest weight you lifted?
81,"My max is 180 lbs, but different days I target different muscle groups with different exercises."
81,"Excellent, thank's for letting me know. I remember taking protein supplements back in the day, they were sorta good. Do you take any?  "
81,"Yes, I enjoy the peanut butter protein powder a few times a week.  I also like to eat clean and meal prep. Do you meal prep?"
81,Cool. I enjoy cocoa and milk as a source of protein. I used to meal prep often before going to class. 
81,its almost the hollidays. You're combination reminds me of hot chocolate. I just drink the protein shake before working out. What did you study?
81,"Thanks, I usually heat the combination, and thus the drink is a healthier 3 ingredient hot cocoa, water, milk cocoa. I studied math and art. "
81,That's awesome. I was terribel at math.
81,Thanks. I think I did a bit better in art than math.
81,Nice. I always did pretty well in art.  How long were you in school?
81,"Thanks! I was in school for about 2 years, almost..."
81,That is a while. Do you work now?
81,"Yes, and its very fun. Thanks!"
82,Do they have a car show associated with it? I like looking at suped up toyota cars.
82,"i only like toyota vehicles. I have a corolla and they drive amazingly,"
82,I had a corolla for several years too. I want to get a Tacoma pickup soon.
82,Nice - They are very fun to drive. I love these music festivals though. Love the food too!
82,What kind of food do they have there?
82,Pretty much food you would find at a fair. All things fried...including cheese. I LOVE cheese.
82,Do you like fried cheese? That is one of my favorites.
82,oh yes! Cheese is one of my favorite foods!
82,i love queso too.
82,especially white queso with some chips - yes! What is your favorite type of food?
82,I like Mexican food a lot. We are doing a taco bar for dinner.
82,"I love that - Have you ever heard of ""Walking tacos""? This is where you take an individual bag of doritos or fritos, and have all of the fixings."
83,"It was great. I enjoyed eating it while listening to Bach,"
83,cool ! i'm listening to bach now
83,Really. Do you enjoy other classical composers?
83,"Bach is very good, he is regarded as of of the greatest of all time."
83,I am aware. I like all things classical. I really enjoy going to museums to view art.
83,I enjoy museims too. They remind me of my mother who died when I was young.
83,I bet that was hard. Do you still struggle with that loss?
83,I do stuggle. Her favorite color was blue so that is now my favorite as well. 
83,That makes perfect sense.  What a lovely way to keep her memory alive.
83,Thank you so much. Is your mother alive too?
84,why do you think depression isn't a mental illness? 
84,I think it falls under a mood disorder and has different characteristics from mental illnesses
84,such as? 
84,"Well, sometimes my art students are depressed and it takes a few days but they snap out of it. "
84,and sometimes someone stays in bed for 2 weeks. There is clearly something wrong 
84,Mental Illness and depression are difficult to deal with when you are isolated
84,there are a lot of unknowns when it comes to mental health because for the longest time we as a society ignored it 
84,Recognizing the reality of mental illness has made life better for many people as they now have access to the proper medication and therapy.
85,"Yes, I defaulted on my son's car payment. "
85,"Oh, no, that's terrible. Do you have any loans that are in danger of going into foreclosure if you stop making payments?"
85,I may lose my house unfortunately. However my husband works in the government and he can help.
85,I'm really sorry to hear that. I hope everything works out.
85,Thanks. Do you have any children?
85,"No, I have no children and am single , but I hope some day to have some."
85,I should never have taken out the loan for my son's car. He can't afford to pay it and neither can I. But I still love him. 
85,"Well, bad things happen to everybody. You just have to learn from your mistakes and look towards the future."
85,Thank you for being sympathetic. I will go back into the workforce and pay it down.
85,That sounds like a good decision. I wish the best of luck to you and your son!
85,Thanks. How is your credit score?
86,That is so cool. Was the work difficult?
86,"No, it was just boring painting the sides of dice all day."
86,That does so sound boring. I would work during the night shifts.
86,What factory do you work in?
86,We make showers and sinks. I sleep all day after my shift.
86,That sounds like hard work. I am trying to make it as a magician in Las Vegas.
86,That sounds like a magical career. I would not fall asleep watching that!
86,Magic is my life. I can read minds!
86,"Okay, what am I thinking now?"
86,I sense....a presence. Have you recently lost a loved one? They are trying to contact you.
86,Thats correct! You'll have no problem making it in Las Vegas.
86,Thank you. Have you ever used a ouija board?
86,I am scared of those.
87,You sound very mature for your age.
87,Yes I don't have many friends because I am congnitively ahead of my peers
87,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you spend much time with your family then?"
87,I do but my dad is super strict so I keep to myself or spend time with my mom. They say that I'm gifted. 
87,"Well, genius is two parts discipline and one part natural ability so you'll probably appreciate your dad's perspective when you're as old as I am"
87,I am just worried about getting into a great college and getting far away from here
87,What worries you about it? Do you think you'll make friends easier in college?
87,I do think I'll find people on the same wavelength on which I am. 
87,I understand. I met my wife in college
87,Wow - that's awesome. That gives me hope. Are you still together?
87,"Yes- as you said, we've always been on the same wavelength"
87,So great - well I hope to truly start my life and find out who I am in college. I am trying to get a full scholarship 
88,Marriage is very good. 
88,"I agree, but in some cultures, marriage is recommended and unmarried folks are frowned upon!"
88,I agree
88,"Then again if you consider having multiple spouses, that could make things easier on a family. A tribe right there at home"
88,We also consider
88,I think people though are naturally jealous so having a family union of 4+ consenting adults can be near impossible 
88,Yes that is correct
89,"Yes, I spent my week lusting after the neighborhood pool boy. "
89,Thats not right. I think you should find better things to do.
89,Well I am very bothered by the voices I hear in my head. They told me to.
89,I have problems too. I am really afraid of heights. 
89,So is the neighborhood pool boy! It is so hard having that problem.
89,People tell me that my belief in mermaids being real is a problem. 
89,Mermaids are real! I have seen one in Mexico. She had red hair 
89,Thank you for saying that. I am as crazy as people say.
89,When I am trying to get the pool boy's attention I pretend to be a mermaid. Do you like going to the pool?
89,I do like going when the weather is nice.
89,Can you dive ?
89,I am not very good at diving. Not like the mermaids.
90,"My internet is really fast, so I can play all kinds of games. I like interacting with others online."
90,"yeah, that's good. Online gaming can have so many applications to help people as well as have fun"
90,"Do you play any games? If so, which ones?"
90,mostly just people online . multiplayer . maybe i should make some real friends huh ?
90,"Haha, I do the same."
90,I always thought about recording the games i play and streaming it live 
90,That's a great idea! I like to listen to live streams when I walk.
90,I'd probably walk into things not paying enough attention 
90,"That's part of the fun, I like being surprised with new places."
90,I also like to play games with friends wile picnicing
90,I haven't gone on a picnic in years.
90,Picnic meals at the park are the best with family in my opinion
91,Do you read much sci-fi?
91,I thought Ender was so cute.
91,"Oh, how so?"
91,Asa Butterfield is a nice actor
91,"I don't know them, what else have they been in?"
91,I don't know. Harrison Ford is my favorite actor 
91,"I loved that movie 'The Fugitive', he was really good in that"
91,He was Han Solo in Star Wars. The bad boy of the galaxy
91,"Yes, the real break-out character"
91,that's my guy ! so i take it you like sci fi ?
91,"Well, my favorite book is 'Enders Game' but I do like Sci-fi in general. A lot of great sci-fi works entered public domain and I'm listening to them on audiobook"
91,i like star trek
92,"ah that sounds nice, you should though meditate. You'll find after a few sessions you'll be more at ease "
92,"I like to draw to relax, you know? Something about focus and giving my hands something to do just is very zen to me"
92,you ever do those adult coloring books? those can be relaxing 
92,"Yeah, although I tend to cut out portions and paste them into my bullet journal"
92,oh? that's a clever idea I have an app on my phone thats semi adult coloring book. I can't find my color pencils anymore
92,"It's just not the same, I think there's a texture thing when coloring in real life"
92,"Oh i fully agree, plus it gives you more creative control "
92,Yes that is definitely a plus!
92,I have to use color books cause I can't draw / scetch anything myself zero art skills
92,"You should try following a Bob Ross tutorial, you might surprise yourself"
92,haha I love bob ross / maybe someday I will try 
92,Do you have any other hobbies?
93,"yes, I've heard of Radioactive.listen to music while running"
93,I really like listening to Imagine Dragons while I work in the garden. It's my favorite thing to do.
93,I will try and see them on tour.
93,They are awesome! I took my grandkids to a live concert of theirs. They laughed when they saw their old Pops getting down to their generation's music!
93,"haaa, nice. how did you first hear about Imagine Dragons?"
93,"It was an accident, actually. I'm a big fantasy novel reader and was Googling dragons to find a new book and they came up on my search!"
93,cool. I'm a big fan of Sci-fi. how many grand children do you have?
93,"I have 4, all boys! The eldest got married last spring and are expecting! This old man is about to be a great grandpa!"
93,awesome. Have you thought about buying a RV to visit all of them?
93,I have. I'd go travel in winter when I don't have the garden to tend to.
93,"nice. Yes, I am considering buying a Van."
93,You can get some awesome vans now that you can practically live in. The minimalist movement has really paved a way for that lifestyle!
94,at the same point it's only a car and as long as there isn't any damage to the metal itself I wont worry about rust
94,It's still the principle though
94,"of course, I agree. it's a shame people are negligent like that "
95,what would your channel be on?
95,"i think i would either make tutorials or maybe music reviews, but i haven't thought it through yet"
95,If you ever want to use my greenhouse as a backdrop let me know
95,"Haha, that would be great. why do you have a greenhouse?"
95,"You know I like gardening, the reason I bought my house was to have a backyard for my greenhouse"
95,"That makes sense. I mean, I bought a house, just so I could have somewhere to park my truck."
95,Yeah I remember you always worrying about it being parked on the street
95,Definitely. It is was a good choice for me
95,How are you finding your neighbors?
95,I haven't gotten a chance to meet them yet. Any advice?
95,Going over and introducing yourself is probably the easiest way
95,yea thats probably a smart move
96,8 full course load 
96,Wow thats alot. I dont like college at all.
96,"I understand, i don't fully agree with the process. I am a firm believer of apprenticeships "
96,College is during the winter and I like the summer time better.
97,how was it?
97,I had no trouble doing it and it was really fun.
97,"That's good. I've been reading a book about professional sports, have you been reading anything recently?"
97,"not really, All i usually do is plant stuff in my garden and make food with it. Tell me more about what kind of sports are you reading about"
97,I am reading about professional cycling to prepare myself for hopefully competing in an upcoming cycling event.
97,goodluck!!! I always wanted to do some kind of sport but my knees wont allow it
97,"Ah, that's unfortunate. How long do you usually spend gardening every day?"
97,about 1 hour in the morning but it varies depending on if i am planting a fruit or something
97,"Interesting, perhaps I will check out a book on gardening soon. Do you see a doctor about your knees?"
97,yeah they can't seem to figure out the reason behind it. They think its all the gardening that is causing it. Does cycling cause you pain in the knees?
97,"I'm sorry about that. No, I've never had any physical difficulties with cycling. Whenever I'm feeling sore, I just stay home and read instead."
97,I should probably rest too. do you like cycling because it allows you to travel more?
98,That's awesome! I used to do volunteer work at an animal rescue too while I studied at Princeton! I loved helping those furry faces!
98,right. I've just started. I was doing IT. And I like working on my feet.
98,I just saw and interesting exhibit about how we domesticated dogs from wolves at the local museum! You should check it out! I bet you'd enjoy it.
98,that sounds very interesting . i'll have to see that .
98,I have memberships to all the museums in town. I'd love to take you as my plus one sometime! I go to a museum every weekend.
98,I really enjoy going to museums to look at historic artifacts.  But I have never been to one in Chicago.  Which museum is your favorite?
98,"To be honest, the children's museum. I take my son there and together we play and it makes me feel like a little kid again too! "
98,"wow, awesome. Yes, I'd love to go sometime."
98,The museum of natural history has a mummy exhibit next month. You might like that since you mentioned you like historic artifacts.
98,I love fossils! thanks.
98,I think the dinosaur exhibit is a permanent exhibit...
98,its on my to do list for sure . i want to see the dinosaurs .
98,The pterodactyl is my favorite!
99,"i really like reading, but nothing ever happens here"
99,I love nothing happening. Thats why i prefer to live in the country.
99,Do you grow flowers? What's it like living in the country?
99,I do grow flower next my home. 
99,Lilies are my favorite
99,I love those too. They remind me of my horse named Beauty. 
99,"Wow, have you read the book Black Beauty? It's about a horse"
99,Thats what inspired my name. I love that book!
99,"cool, what do you do for work?"
99,I raise livestock in the country.
99,I'm a receptionist. I mostly check people in and fill out paperwork
99,That sounds like a boring job.
100,"yeah thankfully, the car was just a little banged up"
100,"Oh, that's good to hear. Did he get arrested?"
100,"I am not sure, the cops took him away though "
100,Hopefully he gets charged with something. No one should be out driving drunk!
100,you'd hope. Cops should offer free car rides or cities should do something like that in cases like that
101,what kind of music do you like?
101,i love all kinds of music! what about you?
101,"I like mostly hip hop but if anything sounds good, I have no problem with it."
101,"last night, i was listening to a band play 70s music at the nursing home i volunteer at"
101,That is very kind of you to volunteer at a nursing home
101,Thank you! I like spending time with the residents
101,I usually like spending time in my garden and creating art
101,I hope to have a garden someday. What sort of art do you do?
101,I like painting and making statues
101,That's really cool. You ought to teach a few classes at nursing homes. I know they'd really like it
101,I think they would too. It might be relaxing for them too. 
101,I know I would love learning how to paint too
102,I like burgers. Do you like vegetarian food?
102,"No, not really, but my wife is all over that stuff."
102,Does she want to be a vegan eventually?
102,"I think she probably will be at some point, maybe I will too, but I really like a nice steak."
102,I do too. Do you like swimming?
102,"Yes, I do, but I do it mostly just to get some exercise. What about you?"
102,I don't know how to swim.....I never learned.
102,You need to learn some day. Do you drink beer? I like Coors.
102,I like Sam Adams lager. it goes well with steak
102,"That's a good one, I like to drink those when I am feeling fancy."
102,I also like Narragansett. Good for the beach
102,"Nice, what do you do for work? I am involved in the car business."
103,She still wont like me im afraid.
103,Say sorry to her and develop your love!!
103,My wife said its because of my love of eating cheetos.
103,"Cheetos really are a good snack, they are super cheesy!"
103,That is why they are my favorite.
103,"I love salty snacks like chips, pretzels, and peanuts!"
103,Those are my wife favorites. I used to buy those for her before she hated me.
103,"i basically a fairly unhealthy eater.  What can I say, I love snacks."
103,We all love snacks. Why would we eat anything else.
103,Exactly! I try to eat healthy sometimes. but it's so easy to just grab junk food on the go and keep it moving.
103,Are you worried about your long term health?
103,"Yes, but I am not overweight and still a young guy.  I have many more years to be worried about my health."
104,I do repairs at the local bike shop
104,sounds like a sweet gig. is the pay well?
104,"it's decent, but honestly our bikes are overpriced"
104,so there are better places to buy bikes in the area?
104,"nah we've got the best quality around here, and I can probably get you a discount"
104,that would be awesome. i'm glad I know a great biker mechanic!
104,It's just that it would be cheaper to fix a bike yourself than to pay us to do it
104,"I understand, I do repairs on my own car to save money sometimes."
104,"What model of car do you have? I got a Yamaha motorcycle. It's not Harley, but it works"
104,I have a 2006 BMW M3 with low miles and it's awesome. I want a motorcycle too.
104,"I like the feel of the wind, it's less constricting"
104,cars are just a little better in the winter haha.

106,yes. I also like Toyota. So where have you traveled?
106,"Theme parks and national parks on fun days, work and school on usual days."
106,nice. Houston's theme park closed. Had a full 360 degree loop ride. Ever been?
106,"no but I have visited and have went to the theme parks, it was fun."
106,nice. Where do you like to buy cars? I've always bought red cars. I think they are more safe also.
106,Thanks. I like to search online then pick up the car at the dealer. Red cars are classic and are safer for they are noticed more.
106,"I used to ride motorcycles. Drivers are safer now, but also the mobile phone use is up."
106,"Interesting, thanks for letting me know. Also, perhaps they can have the phone auto-turn-off during driving somehow."
106,"yeah, makes sense. reminds me of a book I read about Google, and their push into self driving cars. Do you like to read?"
106,"Interesting, I'll check it out! I've always found AI so cool as to how it works. I think self driving would make work life easier."

107,"Oh yes, that was a great movie. Very funny!"

107,"not really, I watch them every now and then but I try not to play with that supernatural stuff"
107,I can understand that! What other genres do you like?
107,I am into just about all movies I have been on a kung fu kick lately 
107,Oh really? Like Kung Fu Panda? ;P

108,Do you like spicy food?
108, Yes. Sriracha goes on everything i eat. Do you like Sriracha or other spices?
108,"Yes I love Sirracha, especially Sirracha mayo."
108,That's delicious. It goes well on poke bowls. Do you like sushi or sashimi
108,Yes I do. My girlfriend got me into it a few years ago. I love Philadelphia rolls the most.
108,Those are very good. The avocado and fish and spice combo is my favorite
108,Avocado goes great with anything sushi.
108,It does! sushi and burgers may be my two favorite foods. Call me basic
108,Have you ever tried making a burger by putting the cheese inside the meat before grilling it? It's great.
109,I'm more of an audience person than a performer myself
109,"nothing wrong with that, sometimes I like being in the audience too!"
109,"I'm actually looking for a job right now, do you know anyone (possibly famous?) looking for an assistant?"
109,"I believe wiz khalifa is looking for an assistant, I could set you up with him."
109,That would be fantastic! Thank you so much!
109,"no problem, are you familiar with his music?"
109,"Not really, but I can spend the next few days doing some research"
109,"He's a great guy and makes awesome music if it fits your taste. I recommend ""on my level""."
109,"Sweet, I'll check it out"
109,Of course. Good luck with the associate job. I'm rooting for you.
109,Thanks again! Do you think he will mind that I'm colorblind?
109,"Shouldn't be an issue, I think Wiz is also colorblind!"
110,do you wanna know my singer name?
110,sure
110,I call myself bubblegum because i have red hair 
110,"You know what, i have always secretly wanted to date red hair as a partner and I hope I will one day"
110,I know a lot of people who you might like. Maybe I can set you up with one of my friends
110,That is very nice of you. I prefer someone who travels often like i do
110,where would you like to take them once you start dating?
110,"preferably, Japan and Switzerland. "
110,I would love to go to Japan too
110,Japan has a very impressive apple store. They always stock up with the newest iphones first
110,ohh really!! I never knew that.
110,"yes, I love new gadgets.Specially from the Apple store. do you use iphone"
111,Do you think you could point me to a couple?
111,"I can't think of any offhand in the area, and I don't get around very much.  Do you have any hobbies?"
111,"I do, I enjoy walking my dog"
111,That's a great way to walk!  It's so motivating walking with a dog.
112,You sound very talented. Do you sing while you do karate?
112,"I sing in my head while I am breaking boards, but I have never done it out loud before."
112,You should try it. I'm sure people would be entertained. I love entertaining
112,What kind of entertaining do you like to do?
112,I tell jokes.
112,Would you like to tell me one of them?
112,Q: Why don’t pirates take a shower before they walk the plank?  A: They just wash up on shore.
112,"Haha, that's a good one! I love humor."
112,I do too. What is your job?
112,"I don't have a job yet, I live with my grandparents."
112,That's nice. I am always early to work because I like to be the first to sit down
112,What is your profession?
113,that's really hard for me right now
113,sometimes you just need to take a break and go find a peaceful place to sit and think.
113,"I know that, but whenever I get to thinking, I just can't figure out who I am"
113,"some people never achieve that, don't get down on yourself."
113,"I used to know, but now I just feel lost and disconnected from everything"
113,That's how i felt when my dog died. maybe you could get a pet
113,My husband and I are afraid of the responsibility
113,that's true they are a lot of responsibility. maybe a snake?
113,What if I forget to feed it?
113,snakes can go weeks without eating.
113,Then that might be the perfect pet for me. Is it true that they eat live rats?
113,"oh yes, snakes are better than cats against mice."
114,"Indeed, the cat must of followed me during my jog session."
114,"Hah, that reminds me of Sylvester & Tweety. Cats are also valued for their companionship."
114,"Thanks. I think we would be a good match, we both like to run."
114,"well, I used to run. now I just sit on the couch most of the time."
114,"Interesting, you can still run with those foot peddle machines if you like."
114,"yes, good idea. I sometimes walk with my golden retriever dog."
114,"Thanks, also, I meant foot ""pedal"". Also, that's very cool that you walk with your dog, its good for bonding."
114,I even use my Golden Retriever to go on hunting trips. He is able to retrieve shot down waterfowl like ducks.
114,That's interesting. I guess the mind of dogs is more complex than we think.
114,Indeed. My son called our dog his cousin for a little while...weird I know.
114,"Perhaps, it could be reincarnation of some kind... I guess we would never know."
114,do you enter races or marathons?
114,"I mostly do jogging for a hobby, but I did run some marathons in school, just half-mile ones. Thanks."
115,i am a very experienced rider since i went to a school that made the sport mandatory
115,"Wow, were you a very successful equestrian while in school?"
115,"i was but I did nto continue it in college. Instead, I completed a degree in education and specialzed in early childhood education. What did you study?"
115,"Fashion, I moved out here to try and break into modeling. "
116,I mainly do it to reduce emissions.
116,I think health related reasons for being a vegetarian is the best
116,"Yes, it can be really healthy! You just have to make sure that you are eating healthy foods when doing it."
116,I mean all vegetarian food are healthy or is there any other plant related food that is not healthy for human consumption.
116,"Well I mean, some people say they are vegetarian, and they just eat french fries and oreos all day."
116,"really! that's something, because French fries is no good food for good health."
116,"Exactly, people should be eating a diet heavy in plants!"
116,"there you go, it's the best and I get your point perfectly well."
116,What kind of music do you listen to?
116,Gospel. 
116,"Cool, I like country, mostly."

118,I love chicken wings! Do you ever bet on any sports games?
118,yes I have. Not in a while though. What about you?
118,I bet on American football mostly. 
118,Nice.  I like the Kansas City Chiefs.
118,"Awesome, I do enjoy a good gamble.  I haven't done too well betting on the Chiefs this year. "
118,Yes they are a little unpredictable with Mahomes injured.
118,Maybe things will turn around.  Do you ever go to the games?
119,can you put your bike on the bus and ride part way?
119,"I could do that, I could listen to another episode on the way over aswell."
119,yeah i don't mind the bus. just have to remember to bring a book or download a podcast. some buses have wifi now too.

119,You as well. Have a great day.
119,what kind of bike are you bringing lol
119,I have a mountain bike so I can use the gears to make the ride less cumbersome but it still takes a long time to get there
120,Absolutely! I usually like to break my fast when I get home from my morning run. 
120,What do you like in breakfast?
120,I usually enjoy oatmeal.  What about you?
120,I love eggs and Bacon
120,I love a good omelet with bacon but it takes me so long to do my hair in the morning that I barely have time to cook. 
120,Well I live on a farm so i get enough time in the morning
120,My favorite time to run is at night so I have time for a cooked breakfast in the morning!
120,I hate running and farming has a lot of work anyways
120,Definitely! I bet you get a good workout. 
120,Yeah!! what do you do for a living?
120,I am actually a professional athlete.
120,wow!!! what sport?
121,no i was not able to take any pics because my boyfrined picked up a fight again
121,Why did he get into a fight?
121,he is in an open relationship and I do not believe in them. 
121,"Same, they just give people an excuse to find someone more compatible instead of working on their current relationship."
121,i absolutely agree. My goal in life is to get married again but I am not able to have a marriage if he is in an open relationship. 
121,"I have never been married myself, but I am still relatively young, and I would like to be someday."
121,you are young. what are you goals in life?
121,"To be successful, professionally, and have a positive impact on the lives of the people that matter to me. Basic stuff. You?"
121,i am a professor at the University of Boston. I want to extend my research and have my research papers published.
121,"That sounds great! I was in the Army, but I got out several years ago."
121,That is a tough choice of career. Thank you for your service. 
121,"I appreciate that. It's funny though, I was in combat, but now I drive a Prius, not a typical army vet car, according to some."
122,That is true. All my family loves eggs. I have at least two daily.
122,I love eggs as well. I don't eat them a lot because the smell sometimes makes me sick though.
122,In my case I do not like the smell of dairy products and I have not consume dairy for a while.
123,I Love sweet tarts
123,Me too! They are so good!
123,Yes they are! Do you love to hike?
123,Not really but I love driving in the mountains.  
123,That sounds like fun. Have you every saw a mountain lion?
123,No I haven't! Have you?
123,"No, I think that would be very exciting!"
123,me too! what animal are you most afraid of?
123,I would say a bear!
123,Oh definitely! Bears are terrifying. I have seen a bear but it was when I was driving!
123,O wow!!!! What did you do with a bear in you eye sight?
123,I drove my Honda in the opposite direction as fast as I could!
124,"Yeah, I actually don't watch a lot of baseball, but I try to follow the world series a little."
124,I watch a lot of baseball but i play basketball more often. in fact I am currently training with my personal coach
124,"Cool, do you play professionally? Or are you trying to make a career out of it?"
124,I was an avid runner in high school and found my interest in basketball in college. I am training to make it a career now. How about you? 
124,I am in the automotive sales business. I source cars for a large business.
124,"i see, how did you find your interest in auto?"
124,"I have just always loved cars since a young age. I love talking about cars with people, and advising them on which ones are good to buy."
124,I am looking for a vehicle currently. Any suggestions?
124,"Toyota and Honda makes the most reliable cars, hands down. Corollas and Camrys run forever. Stay away from German cars."
124,why do you say that
124,"I very consistently see Toyotas with over 200k miles. I see a lot of German cars that have issues before they even hit 100k, plus they depreciate heavily."
124,ohhhh okay that makes more sense
125,oh that would be fun! Do you do a lot of photography?
125,"Yes, I use a digital camera or digicam. It is really fun!"
125,I like to take photos as well.  I have four siblings so I do a lot of family shots for them. 
125,Did you every watch moonlighting with Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis. They were private detectives. You should try to watch it if you ever have a chance
125,I have never watched it but I will look into it.  I'm only 5'3 so I am always a scaredy cat!
125,cool . i'm not biased about size . my dog is smaller than the cat
125,I am the shortest person in my family so my height has always been brought up.  
125,i am the shortest too . haha if only i could grow an inch or 2.
125,that would definitely be nice.  do you have any siblings?
125,I do! I have a younger brother and sister!
125,"oh wow, the shortest and the oldest. I am the youngest of five.  "
125,5 eh? Good - that's my favourite number!
126,We could never have to many registered nurses
126,There will always be sick people. 
126,Aren't you worried about getting sick yourself?
126,"Not really. we take precausions to prevent that. Besides, sick people need someone who wants to be with them no matter what they have."
126,Does that require you to be away from your spouse for long periods of time?
126,Yes. Espeacially if you work at a hospital
126,How would one try to become an RN
126,"There are courses for it at most colleges. Takes two to four years to get, but if you love helping people, then it is worth it."
126,"I would really love to join a part of the medical field, all it takes is dedication and hard work to achieve anything!"
126,That is so true. If more people would realize their potential the world would be so much better
126,I couldn't agree with you more.
126,Too many people are lazy and look for the easy way though
127,I did not eat them much either. This year I changed my diet and that feels better.
127,I should probably change mine too because i have become round and my cheeks are getting bigger
127,And It  is hard to loose that weight. I was even working in improving my appearance because I did not pay attention to that at all. 
127,Yeah I tried it earlier but it is harder than it seems
127,"That is true, I even grew a beard for the fist time. I looked different."
127,really!!! how old are you?
127,"I am already a mature person, more than forty but I like to keep a young spirit.  I love sports and music. What about you?"
127,i just 31 this year . feeling like i need to get my life moving
127,That is always a good attitude. Trying always something different and positive. About the beard I might have it for a few months and then shave it off. 
127,don't shave!! keep it!! it is healthy for you
127,"At least is good for the cold season!!  and talking abut healthy, do you exercise?"
127,yea mostly but I have been slacking off lately
128,I'm sorry to hear that.  Why are you insecure?
128,I am not insecure. 
128,"Which do you prefer, selling houses or waitressing?"
128,I like selling houses more because I don't have to interact with lots of people.
128,You prefer the one on one relationships.  I can understand that.  Have you been selling houses a long time?
128,Exactly. I have been selling houses since I was 12 years old!
128,Really!  That is impressive.  What kinds of houses?
128,mostly larger houses that celebrities buy. I sold one once for $10 million.
128,How were you able to sell houses when you ere 12?
128,"Well it wasn't just me, my parents helped me through the process. But my name was on the sign!"
128,That's impressive.  How many years have you been selling houses?
128,Well I'm 100 now so about 88 years!
128,I think you are Joking but it's been fun chatting
128,I was hehe. great chatting with you
129,How do you know stuff like that?
129,Both of my parents are optometrist... let's just say I have 20/20 vision.
129,"That's a good one! I am a waitress, personally."
129,I was a waitress in college.  My height gave a lot of looks as I am over six foot tall. Everyone mentioned it.
129,I bet you have a lot of people at the grocery store asking for you to reach for things on the top shelf.
129,Every time I walk in the store I am ready for someone to ask for help.  Both of my parents were over six foot as well. 
129,"Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. My parents are average height and so am I, haha."
129,I got my height and my eyesight from my parents!
129,Have you ever been out of the country? I am probably going to be moving to Australia to marry my partner soon.
129,oh wow thats exciting! I have never been out of the country
129,"I have not either. I am excited, but also very nervous. "
129,Australia sounds amazing.  I bet it will be really nice once you are there and settled. 
130,I didn't know that but i've been a youtuber for 5 years now
130,5 years is a long time.You have a lot to catch-up.
130,Like what?
130,Google bought YouTube in November 2006 for $1.65 Billion. Imagine what you could do with that much money.
130,I would buy more pink cars. maybe a thousand of them!
130,"I would travel, buying cars sound great, that would be awesome. But I would prefer traveling."
130,you can travel with all your cars. think about it! 
130,"Yeah, depending on the destination travel could be really easy or really hard."
130,how hard would it be to drive to Antarctica?
130,"I think nearly impossible, but I wold be happy to take a flight even though it would not be cheap and then take a boat."
130,That's true. Can I come with?
130,It would be cool to plan. But for now I have to get ready for my first day as a safety patrol tomorrow!
131,I ran into cobwebs and there were ghosts that jumped out at us
131,That is really spooky. I once saw a guy that I SWEAR was a vampire.
131,I don't like to be touched so it was very scary for me
131,"I go on hikes sometimes, and the thing I hate the most is when a spider web that I don't see catches on my face. I hate that."
131,I wouldn't like that either.  I like to listen to linkin park it helped calm me down
131,I listened to a lot of Linkin Park as a teenager. Very sad that the singer passed away.
131,I think music is a great comfort
131,I agree. I love that music is so easy to access these days. You can find almost everything you'd ever want through YouTube and Spotify.
131,yes it goes with you whereever you want to go and can change your mood so easily
131,What is your favorite band or artist?
131,Linkin park of course. How about you?
131,A Finnish rock band called Nightwish.
132,"You can actually count cards to make an informed guess, but it is usually frowned upon in casinos."
132,I don't have the best of luck at casinos.
132,"Yes, I am a dealer in a casino, and I can say that it takes tons of practice."
132,Do you have to have a special talent to be a dealer?
132,"No, not really. You can generally learn the skills on the job while being trained, but it helps to be outgoing."
132,Is it fun learning to become a dealer?
132,"Yes, I love it. Plus you can make really good tip money if you like to talk to people."
132,Do dealers encounter many issues with players?
132,"Sometimes. It usually is due to people being intoxicated, but security is usually pretty good about taking over in those issues."
132,"It seem like becoming a dealer would be a fun job to pursue, I would love to learn to become a dealer."
132,"I would definitely recommend it. It is relatively easy, and a lot of fun."
132,Thanks so much for the information
133,Mostly pastas.  What do you like to do?
133,I am a model. I like doing photo shoots.
133,Oh that must be very interesting.  I am too short to model and too clumsy.  How did you get started?
133,A director approached me while they were making a movie. Short people can model as well.
133,Would I have seen your picture somewhere?
133,No. I just started. Where did you learn to cook?
133,"I learned from my mother mostly who was a very good cook.  If I were able to go to Italy, I would love to go there to learn more"
133,I would love to go to Italy. I love Italian foods and I have a lot of Italian friends.
133,Have you been anywhere in Europe?
133,"No. Just would love to visit. Your mom seems to have taught you well, then."
133,"Yes, she was a good teacher.  Where was your most exciting photo shoot?"
133,I do interior designing as well. I did some work for TLC and that included some modeling with my decor ideas.
134,I need to always carry a book with me.. and have a a good cup of coffee too.
134,I can't stand coffee. I usually prefer a nice cup of tea!
134,Tea works for me too. What kind of books do you like?
134,"I like auto-biographies mostly, which most people find boring. What about you?"
134,"I like those too, and also fiction. Some authors are good mixing fiction with real places and people, those are my favorite."
134,"Yeah, I definitely see the appeal with fiction. Reading is an escape for some people!"
134,"To me reading is a need. But is not my only hobby, I also love sports and music."
134,Oh I absolutely agree. What's your favorite sport?
134,"I love soccer and swimming, and things that you can do with a lot of friends, hiking too. And do you have a favorite sport?"
134,I love swimming and hiking as well. I don't know too much about soccer though.
134,"That is cool, the nice thing about swimming is that you can go to really nice places, like the ocean, a river or a lake. "
134,"I agree. I think besides a regular pool, the ocean is my favorite place to swim! Sometimes rivers and lakes are too mucky."
135,Oh I hate when there are things messing with my computer.  Do you have any plans for the day?
135,i've no plans . today is a rest day for me .
135,That's always nice.  What do you do on other days?
135,"I work and I have had been working in the same place for 8 years,  what about you?"
135,I have worked the same place for 6 years. What do you like to do when you aren't working? I like to watch movies
135,"I love music,  sometime i watch concerts on youtube, specially rock concerts. Do you like rock?"
135,"Yes, I do.  I also like jam bands.  i like live music the most"
135,"Live music is the best, weather is in a restaurant of a super big concert, I enjoy it a lot"
135,I also like open air concerts and amphitheaters.  
135,"That is right. I like summer concerts in an open field, I would like to go to a Rolling Stones concert one day."
136,yes i have a puppy
136,I have always wanted one. Especially because you can dress them up in purple!
136,i love dogs.what do you when you are free
136,"I do a little bit of both working and watching/listening to TV, I play games, how about you?"
136,i like walking at the park with my dog and sometimes go to the gym
136,That's great exercise. What's your favorite workout? Have you tried Kettlebells? You should try Spartan Racing!
136,i haven't tried those yet i will try them out. i love yoga
136,Interesting. What kind of Yoga? I do hatha
136,wow.thats my choice too
136,Very cool! I like the intense workout. I've done Kundalini too but hatha gives you that core. Bikram is way too HOT!
136,yeah..working out is fun
136,yes it is! extends your life
137,"Yes, there is a vegan section in the deli. It used to be small but not anymore."
137," It is really cool that the vegan section has expanded! I like to eat organic, and I am on alow carb diet. "
137,Good for you! I did the same for a month and felt great!
137,"Awesome!  It's so hard to find good vegal substitutes, but I think it's worth it."
137,"Yes, I takes a lot of effort. I think taking care of your health is a great goal."
137,And it takes a healthy diet to lead a healthy life! It also takes good music! So what is your favorite band?
137,"Music is health to me! I love U2, nirvana and many others, I am also learning to play the guitar. How about you?"
137,"I am a vocalist, and my favorite band is Bon Over.  I like all kinds of music!"
137,That is awesome! I also like different kinds of music like jazz and even classical
137,"Jazz is beautiful, do you ever get to go to jazz clubs?"
137,"I have not, I have gone to jazz festivals, but it would be cool to go to a nice jazz club."
137,Jazz music is seen my America's classical music. Should totally try it sometime
138,"I like both eggs and dairy, particularly dairy!"
138,I like them as well.  I could never be a vegan for that reason
138,"I try to limit meat consumption, but i have kids.  So I often cook what i know wont be wasted"
138,"Yes, having kids to feed throws a wrench in my meal planning as well.  How many kids do you have?"
138,I have 3 children and husband.  How about you?
138,I have three children as well and a husband
138,"I am a nurse, what do you do?"
138,i work at a children hospital . it was always a dream of mine
138,Wow we do have alot in common!  Which one do you work at?
138,Blank Children's. I have been there 6 years
138,Oh ok.  I don't think we have an exclusive Children's hospital around me.
138,Will you encourage your children to become nurses?
138,I would but none are interested as of yet
139,"Thanks! I'm also looking to learn how to write in cursive, do you know any local classes?"
139,"I haven't written in cursive since grade school.  However, my ex-wife knows Caligraphy.  I suggest taking an online class to practice up."
139,"Okay, I'll look online. Are there any concerts going on soon? I like to listen to some strange music."
139,Shpongle is a weird group.  I think they are touring this winter.
139,Great. What are you doing today?
139,"It is just starting to get cold, so I am going to put the roof on my Jeep Wrangler."
139,"That's a good idea, I should start preparing for winter as well."
139,Yeah.  This summer was so hot!!!!!!!!!  I am hoping for a chilly fall and frigid winter!!!
139,I agree! I'm excited to see what winter brings into the area.
139,I'm sure we are going to get pounded with snow.  Gotta watch out for the black ice!!!
139,Yes! I'd better get to the store soon to pick up some salt. When do you guys normally start seeing snow around here?
139,Usually in December but with climate change we could get a November blizzard!
140,Yes. I can't believe he would do this knowing what I'm going through with the divorce!
140,"Yeah, well, my big brother once hit me in the head with the claw end of a hammer."
140,"What a jerk! If I was there I could've helped you, since I'm in my second year of medical school."
140,"Ha-ha.  Yeah, no doubt.  I was just a kid and kind of indestructible.  We fought a lot."
140,That's very unfortunate. I hope my two kids never fight that way. Are you on good terms with your brother now?
140,We are great friends now.  I don't get to see him so much since I'm on tour with my band.
140,"I'm happy to hear that, I hope you get to seem him soon. Maybe he can come to see one of your shows."
140,"Yeah, he's been to a few.  I was hoping we could do X-mas with the whole family.  Maybe next year."
140,I don't know how Christmas is gonna go with my family this year either... it's hard to be divorced when there's two kids mixed in.
140,"Divorce is the WORST.  I, too, am divorced.  Worst experience of my life.  I don't speak to my ex."
140,I'm sorry to hear that. It's very hard. I'm just ready to be done with the process.
140,It will get better over time.  Focus on your kids if you can.  It's gotta be rough.  Oh and get another partner!
141,Corky is adorbs! His little tail! He loves to go to the mall!
141,"It's the most cute, it's so small"
141,They snore so much. I like having an excuse to shop at the mall and everyone loves him
141,"Do you have dogs? I have two, they love being in the yard"
141,"I have 2 as well, we have a backyard too. They must bring you joy!"
141,"Yes, I did not have dogs when I was a kid, and now I love dogs."
141,"I grew up with them, I couldn't see my life without one"
141,I have a german shepherd and a pug. The always love to play. I am working on a painting of them.
141,Wow you paint? Those are great breeds.
141,"Yes, I love to paint and also many other kinds of art. What about you?"
141,I like to paint wargame miniatures like warhammer but that's nothing compared to what you do
141,That is pretty cool. I am learning also some gardening because want to do something creative with my yard
142,Onee of my signature confection is Apricot Brandy pound cake
142,"Interesting. I love to play musical instruments as well, specifically the trumpet. Do you play anything?"
142,No I would rather sew than I would paly an instrment
142,"Besides sewing, what other crafts do you do? My wife does wood burning."
142,I quilt alot
142,Do you participate in any social groups? I love making friends and would love to join one.
142,"sounds lame, but a quilt guild..."
142,I think I'll look into it. Seriously.
142,Look into what?  quilting?
142,"Yup, I might make my own quilting club actually. Do you want to join?"
142,most likely not.  
142,"Hm, okay. I'll probably make a Facebook group to recruit members."
143,Do you like Metallica speaking of Iron (my fav band)? Try supplements!
143,I love Metallica!  I like to workout with their songs.  The documentary they did was interesting!
143,I thought so too! Rock on! I read autiobiographies before bed I keep hoping one day Lars will do one after retirement
143,"I went to see ""Monsters of Rock"" and I thought Metallica was the loudest band I ever heard.  Then came Guns n Roses."
143,That must have been awesome. Lol face melting loud huh?
143,Oh man
143,Do you go to live shows?
143,I went to a lot when I was younger.  Not so much anymore as I usually have family duties to tend to.  You?
143,Not as I get older but I remember the Dead live
143,I love the parking lot scene at Dead shows.  I was never a die hard fan but sure loved the trip.  Ha-ha!
143,Right on brotha man you know whats up
143,Probably the most insane festival I have ever been to was Burning Man.  Ever go?  It's crazy!
144,"Oh, that's the same year my son was born.  Do you have kids?"
144,Yes I have 3 and big kid (husband).
144,Ha that's funny.  Some men never grow up.
144,Yes do your kids still live at home?
144,No my kids are grown and have moved out.  Its kind of quiet sometimes but I like to get out and hike.
144,"Yes it is nice when they are independent, I didnt think I would adjust as well as I am."
144,Do they live close enough to see them when you want?
144,"Real close!  With me, LOL ;-) But they are in college and busy with work and school."
144,Oh that's an exciting time.  Two of my 3 live nearby but my oldest is 1800 miles away on the west coast
144,"My oldest is talking of a move to California, how do feel about the distance with a child?"
144,Well it is difficult but you just have to make time to go see them.  He lives in a gorgeous area and I can hike alot there.
144,Yes it is nice to have a common interest and that you enjoy vacation there.  Any grandkids yet?
144,yes 4 grandkids and that is very fun.  Be wary of California with all the wildfires
144,I KNOW!  We visited LA last November and brought masks
144,It's unfortunate.  My son is in Oregon and they struggle all summer long
144,"Oh gosh, the smoke is there too?  I didnt know that."
145,Fair enough. I don't think there is much need for that traditional view myself. 
145,Sometimes I think too much about that. when that happens I go out and run for a few minutes.
145,Me as well. Nothing like a run to help clear the mind. 
145,"Yes, that is why I love running and also try to be healthy. What about you?"
145,"Same here. I went for a run over my lunch break actually. Not far, just five miles. "
145,"lol , congrats . i've never done something like that . you sound brave"
145,It isn't a big deal. I try to run at least 5km about 5 times a week. 
145,"That is awesome, I think I might follow your example, and also I would keep eating healthy."
145,"I should eat better. I've had a lot of candy today, lol"
145,"I can relate to you. I love chocolate, but I have not had one in a year. "
145,Good for you. That's much better than I can do. 
145,I took healthy cooking lesson. When I get married I will cook for someone
146,do you play basketball?
146,Yes! I'm not very good at it though. I enjoy playing badminton more than basketball.
146,intresting one of my 4 siblings plays badmition
146,"Wow, that's a lot of siblings. I only have one. What is that like?"
146,Learned patience and how to share at a young age
146,"Cool, siblings can be like really good friends if they get along. I'd say me and my sister get along pretty well."
146,"That is true.  I have a fav sibling, but I love them all"
146,Do your siblings play sports as well?
146,"No, but thye have very odd jobs:  butcher, poll worker and turkey plucker"
146,Wow! You sure do have an interesting family.
146,I like to think so -- keeps things lively
146,I hope to have a large family like that someday.
147,I am not much of a rollerblader ot hockey player. I spent most of my tiem travelling so I don't really have tiem for that.
147,You sound fun! How often do you get to travel? Do you get to work out?
147,"My travel is my workout, getting around and always up and going. In fact, ill be going to the barbados next month "
147,You are so lucky! I love the Caribbean but I have never been there. I hope you have a great time
147,"thanks, carribeans are nice but Jamaica is my favorite."
147,You are so lucky! Jamaican culture is very vibrant. I hear the food is amazing
147,"yes it is, have you been?"
147,No but I would like to one day. Life goals.
147,I recommend attending their traditional ceremonies. They are so educational and interesting. 
147,"History is one my favorites as well and will check it out when I go, thank you"
147,let me be your tiur guide if you go
147,"That would be awesome, always helps to have an expert"
148,How many people die from skydiving each year?
148,I'm not sure but probably a lot.
148,I definitely want to try it before I finally give up the ghost.  It must be exciting your first time.
148,I need to work on fear first and then I will try it.
148,"Yes, sir!  I get chills just imagining stepping out onto the wing of the plane."
148,That's amazing. I have only been on a few planes in my life.
148,It would be great to fly through the air high above some beautiful Nevada desert.
148,"Agreed, that would be badass."
148,Could you imagine?  It would be like sky diving on Mars.
148,I don't think we could do that. NASA wouldn't let us.
148,Yeah but maybe Elon Musk can find a way to get around NASA's red tape.
148,"i dunno , i think we still gotta get on the moon for the first real time ."
149,Why doesn't it seem nice? I think it is ideal
149,"I was in a movie when I was young, played an individual who was married, marriage is hard!"
149,"I see, ok. Are you still acting?"
149,"On and off, I hope to be a star one day, just gotta keep plugging at it"
149,That is really cool! What made you want to be an actor?
149,I was in TV commericials when I was young and that got me started
149,That's great. I wish you luck with your career
149,"Thanks, I apprreciate that.  Hope your patential marriage foes well as well"
149,"Thank you! I love my gf a lot, and look forward to spending my life with her"
149,"that's amazing , commitment is great but marriage you definately have to work at ."
149,"I believe it! My brother is married, and he tells me that it's a lot of work, but worth it"
149,Agreed.  Lots of happy storeis out there
150,"I have to think about that, not sure yet. Any suggestions?"
150,i don't know . . . maybe pizza ?
150,Yeah! why not. It is not that hard and I have done it in the past. thanks
150,what kind of restaurant do you want ?
150,I want a place that has both outdoors and indoors option and with live music.
150,That is good to hear I would enjoy a night with some great music.
150,"Yes, I would be a very active place.Perfect for me because I like to be very active.  "
151,"I meant all of his books, yet.  He is my favorite writer.  I loved ""Longest Ride""."
151,Which one?  Was it good? As a school psychologist those might be good reads
151,"My wife really likes the book he wrote entitled ""See me"".  You ever read that one?"
151,"No I did not, what is it about? "
151,I haven't opened it up yet.  It was a birthday gift I gave to her over the summer. 
151,It is nice gift for bithday. I have 4 siblings lol maybe I'll give them the mass gift
151,Wow that's a big family.  I wish my brother and sister read more.  My wife is a voracious reader.
151,I do love to read as well. Have you read permanent record? eye opening stuff.
151,Is that the book about Edward Snowden?  He was just on Joe Rogan's podcast.  
151,Yes. That was a good JRE too. Joe was disappointed about the aliens >.<
151,Ha-ha.  Joe wants aliens or big foot more than he wants ganja during sober October.
151,"haha that's funny, he's a boss for doing it but no way for me. Watching him light up after sober october with the whiskey was great"
152,"Ah, that's interesting. I love reading, especially comics."
152,I like to read too. I do it everyday. /enjoy it while traveling even more.
152,Where do you like to travel?
152,Everywhere. I love to teach people from other cultures and help them improve their lives.
152,Fascinating. I tend to travel close to home because I only travel by train. Where are you traveling to next?
152,"to new york , my brother lives there he attends west point"
152,"I used to live in NY, it's amazing there. They have a lot of comic book stores, I always visit so many whenever I'm there."
152,"I also like comic books, so called comic magazines, i like old ones also"
152,What is your favorite genre of book to read?
152,"For me, The Bible, and then travel books, fiction and pretty much I read everything. What about you?"
152,I also enjoy fiction. I also occasionally enjoy reading books about zoology.
152,"Good for you, reading is like a universe, so many options.."
153,A caregiver is someone who takes care of people who cannot ordinarily take care of themselves.
153,I did a little bit of that when I was in college.  I took care of a few autistic adults.  It was emotional.
153,"That must have been an interesting experience. I've read about adults with autism, it sounds quite difficult. What did you learn from the experience?"
153,One thing was how big their personalities could be.  My guy was hilarious.  He told great jokes!
153,That's very interesting. What did you go into after college?
153,I went to work in Silicon Valley for a semiconductor company.  I should have tried out for Dancing with the Stars!
153,"That sounds like a cool job. I dropped out of high school, and a few years later started a small business with my dad."
153,W
153,Sorry?
154,Actually I think he is nervous
154,I hope so. It's a big year for kids.
154,right!  I am so glad to not have to be a millenial
154,I'm a Millenial unfortunately (1982) but I swore I was Gen X growing up
154,LOL.  I feel for you and kids now a days.  I feel like it is much harder for young people now.  
154,Especially as you get older its harder I have no clue what people are even saying with the lingo.
154,you mean older ppl (like me) or those younger than you
154,in general people younger than me but I'm almost 40 so it's a different world than the one I grew up in
154,Yes I see what you mean.  There are alot of nuances to communication texting and PC communication has added.
154,yea and now smart phones are everything! I'm cool with it but my first video game system was a 2600
154,I think it is weird when i see 2 people texting in a room with me
154,Haha I hate that. I do agree with the text or call instead or doorbell
155,I can't wait for the Washington Nationals parade to celebrate their World Series win.
155,I am also eagerly waiting for the moment
155,What a great series.  I was biting my nails the entire time.  I thought Houston was going to pull it out.
155,That nice .You seems very eager to this.isn't it?
155,Yeah.  I like having baseball on in the background while I work.  I also love the stats.  Fun!
155,I hope the home team wins.
155,"I cheer for the home team usually, too.  Unless of course, the home team is the Yankees."
155,I love the Yankees.
155,Are you from New York?
155,"Yes, I am one of the 325 million people who live in the United States."
155,"Oh, we've got that many people now?  Wow.  It sure is getting crowded."
155,Sure is.
156,I agree! Math is way too hard. If you need help you can always ask though!
156,That's true. What are you studying math for?
156,I had to take some math classes to finish my nursing degree. I only took them because they were mandatory though. Why are you studying math?
156,I'm hoping to go into engineering. So I better improve my math! Don't want to be serving tables forever.
156,You can do it! I'm more of an athlete. I have travelled lots for competitions which was great. Have you travelled anywhere?
156,"Last year, I went to Belarus. It was really interesting, the country is almost lost in time. Have you ever been to Eastern Europe?"
156,That's awesome! I'm truly jealous. I would love to do more travelling but it's so expensive. Did you travel alone or with friends / family? 
156,"I went with a friend from my university. I enjoyed the food, but I definitely missed American cuisine too."
156,That's awesome! I
156,My favourite thing about American food is the french fries - I probably eat too many for my own good!
156,I live in Canada and we have poutine so that's even worse for you! Have you tried poutine before!?
156,"Yes, I have. It's really tasty! I like the gravy."
157,ughhhh i was proud that i graduated but i don't do anything with my degree
157,Well you should be proud of graduating.  Why didn't you do anything with your degree?
157,"Because whenever I get an interview they always say ""we decided to move forward with someone else"". It's too much work to keep going to those stupid interviews anyways. "
157,Well you will never get in if you don't keep trying?  What are you doing instead?
157,Just watching Shark Tank. They have it so easy. I just have to think of something that'll sell and then I'll never have to work! 
157,Well that seems like a lot of work and a little risky but I am sure you can think of a good idea
157,I know right? It's why I can't think of anything. I wish that I was more imaginative and could think of something. What do you watch? 
157,well I like Naked and afraid but I would never do the show.  I have problems with interviews too when they see my hair
157,OMG that's so much work. And what's wrong with your hair? I bet you have nicer hair than me though 
157,Really?  My hair is blue and orange right now
157,like Auburn? Do you watch college football? I love Auburn's team 
157,I watch some college football but not a lot.  My hair is blue and orange now but will be pink and purple next
158,"A year ago. I'm in Houston, waitressing at a local club since she passed. I'm hoping to move to Australia soon with my BF though."
158,"Australia, that sounds exciting!  Why there?"
158,My family is from Perth
158,"Wow, and how did you end up in Houston?"
158,My boyfriend is in the military and it was this or Fort Worth
158,I see.  Ive never met anyone from Australia here in states.
158,We have an accent so I'm told but I think people here have the accent :D
158,"Yes we definelty speak differently, I love an Aussie accent!!"
158,Try listening to an old Australian man from the outback and you'll need a robot translator
158,I was wondering if there were different sub languages or dialects
158,"Oh yes. But the older and more sun baked you get, the more it becomes like an ewok village the remote places lol"
158,Are than many... dialects?
159,Not really. Let's talk about food. What do you like to eat? I LOVE fish 
159,I like fish too.  But really I am not picky.  Do you eat a lot of fish?
159,"I eat pretty much only fish. My parents do too, and they're both over 6 feet. Probably cause of the fish LOL "
159,Possibly.  How do you like to prepare your fish?
159,"I LOVE salmon. Sear it with some rosemary, lots of butter, and some lemon. to DIE FOR. "
159,That sounds wonderful - what do you like for side dishes?  I eat lots of veggies
159,Some shittake mushrooms and asparagus stirfried with olive oil - I'm a big keto fan so it suits fish 
159,I like the way you think - and EAT!  Sounds very healthy
159,I'm just worried about where I get my fish - sometime i get scared about mercury and other toxins 
159,"Yes, I have that worry too - you can never be sure, can you?"
159,It's why I pay extra for wild salmon and organic stuff - call me a health nut but when I'm 95 who's laughing? LOL 
159,95? That's amazing.  Maybe you should write a book
160,I usually watch matches with relatives. It's sort of a family tradition!
160,That's awesome! Family traditions are the best! Did you do anything for Halloween? It was an excuse to eat chocolate for me.
160,"I bought a lot of candy to hand out, but not many kids showed up! So now I'm stuck with a lot of chocolate, and way too much candy!"
160,"Hey, that sounds like a win to me! More candy for you! What do you like to do for fun?"
160,"I play for my college's basketball team. Between that and my studies, I don't have much free time. What about you?"
160,That sounds fun! I'm pretty busy with studies too but i like to geocache with my boyfriend. What do you study? 
160,"That's really cool. I'm studying education, hoping to become a teacher. What are your career ambitions?"
160,Cool! My boyfriend is in education as well and is on his first placement. I'm in my senior year of psychiatric nursing. Are you enjoying it?
160,"Very interesting. I am enjoying it, yes. I'm a bit nervous about entering the job market though. Congrats to your boyfriend! What got you interested in psychiatric nursing?"
160,Well we always need new amazing teachers so I'm sure you'll be fine. I was very interested in both nursing and pscyhology and that's psych nursing!
160,Thank you. It sounds like you've found the perfect career fit!
160,You too! I'm sure you will make a fabulous teacher and I wish you the best!
161,Well she was doing quite well with putting books on the shelf at least.
161,"So she should be good to go. AT least she isn't like me, 2 years pre med, 2 kids, divorced. I wish I had a job that calming!"
161,Well working as a librarian can be calming for the most part for sure. Sometimes that quiet time gets annoying though.
161,I am not used to the quiet! It must be a lot of organizing for you every day.
161,I haven't been working here long so it isn't bad so far. I imagine I'll get tired of the sorting eventually though.
161,"yes! Yin and yang, balance in all things. You'll do great there."
161,"I love the learning part. Like just the other day I ran across this book ""Swimming for Dummies"" which was terrific since I don't know how to swim!"
161,i think you might be able to teach yourself but its better to get professionally taught.
161,"You might be right about that. Being an adult, I have so much anxiety over water as a result."
161,"oh yes anxiety is a terrible thing, you are brave to deal with it. It won't take that long and you'll be squared away"
161,"Yep, or at the bottom of a lake somewhere. So how was med school anyway?"
161,honestly it was boring! The hours are brutal. It's nice knowing I am able to save lives and help others
162,"What is Suet, it is birdseed here."
162,It's a herb mixture here but it makes me gassy so I don't eat it often HA
162,"and Yorkshire, kidney meaning organ or legume?"
162,kidney like in the organ
162,Yuck!!
162,"Yes, quite gross.  Let's talk about some other kinds of food.  What is your favorite?"
162,"I love to cook, try to stick to veggies and chicken or fish mostly"
162,"Really, Do you have favorite recipes or do you try new recipes out all the time?"
162,"Well I would love to hone indian cooking skill, but not loving my creations at all."
162,I think indian cooking would be difficult to master - lots of unique spices
162,"right!  We had an indian grocery, I loved to go in, but it closed down."
162,Oh I'm sorry to hear that.  We have one here that has been open for a long time
163,It went better than I expected. It was a really good crowd.
163,That's great that it went so well! Props to the crowd too!
163,"Yeah, thanks! Have you always felt anxious, or is this a recent thing in your life?"
163,"I've always dealt with it, especially when it involves a lot of people. I'm hoping it gets easier though!"
163,I'm sure it will. I've found that spending time with animals really helps to calm me down.
163,That's a really good suggestion. Thank you! I have found that spending time with animals definitely helps me relax.
163,Do you have any pets?
163,"Yes, I do! I have two cats. They're great! How about you?"
163,"I've got a bulldog. He's hilarious, super lazy. Never likes to go for walks!"
163,"Aw, bulldogs are very cute! I can relate to the laziness haha. My cats are lazy as well. "
163,That's too funny. How old are they?
163,One is six years old and the other just turned 2 yesterday actually. How old is your bulldog?
164,"Honestly, I don't care much about looking good while I dance. I just like to have fun! What do you like to do for fun?"
164,too experienced for me . i have 2 left feet .
164,That's okay. You can't be good at everything! Do you have any plans for this weekend?
164,"We have been away past 2 weekends and I just want to be home, plus i'm sick."
164,That's understandable. It's nice to relax at home. I hope you get better soon!
164,"Yes me too, I have been sick with cold going on 4 weeks."
164,Yikes that's a long time! Have you been to a doctor? 
164,I was actually the first week and had my flu shot then.
164,Oh okay. Hopefully they get the flu shot right this year. I still have to get it. Did you celebrate Halloween yesterday?
164,"I was home sick, but we had trick or treaters!"
164,That's good! Hopefully you'll be healthy for Christmas at least! Have you started shopping for that already?
164,"Not yet, have you?"
165,all workers are talented in their specific field
165,"They are. It takes a lot of time to learn new skills, but not all are rewarded equally."
165,yes. obviously everyone are gain knowledge through experience
165,exactly! That is why I'm learning how to be a welder through gaining experience in practical training.
165,sounds good. all the best for your work
165,Thank you! I hope that one day I will be able to weld together metal rollercoaster structures.
165,thats seems good
165,it is. Do you have a favourite rollercoaster park?
165,not have any specific park but I like to ride big rollercoaster
165,I like rollercoasters that have lots of loops in them.
165,yah that move our soul to the peak!
165,"yeah! But I'm scared of heights, so I don't like it when they have steep drops."
166,I don't like my roomates
166,What's going on with your roomates?
166,"They are immature fist time away from mommy, alot of partying and debauchery."
166,What's your age compared to your roomates? 
166,"LOL, we are same age, but not the same level of maturity LOL."
166,I can completely relate to that. I am a 1st grade teacher and some of my students are more mature. 
166,Do you like teaching?  I am thinking about it?
166,"I love to teach, it's very rewarding. What grade would you like to teach?"
166,"I don't know yet, I like english and history.  I am nervous about the field in general"
166,Maybe your roomates are adding to the stress. Can you change your roomates? 
166,"Could be, I am am off focus.  Not easily.  I have been spending most of my time at work or library."
166,"Well, the library is a good place to start. Maybe the librarian can help you better define your carer focus."
167,Oh nice! Did you know I own a Chevy Tahoe?
167,Really? I've wanted one of those for years!
167,"Yeah, it's super nice! The sound system is great!"
167,I bet! How much did it cost you?
167,"I got it used for only $15,000!"
167,Wow that's a great deal! Did you buy it online or from a friend?
167,I bought it online. I was looking for something with plenty of space.
167,"Yeah I bet it's useful for shopping and fitting all your friends and family into, right?"
167,It's perfect for that! Can fit the entire family with no one complaining about it being cramped.
167,I bet! Having a car like that would make me want to go on a long road trip!
167,Oh its so good! I like listening to rock music and just finding new roads to drive on!
167,rock music is great for listening to while driving! I also really like to listen to korean pop music because it has a catchy beat when you're driving.
168,Yes! I hope she enjoys the food here. What is your favorite?
168,I really enjoy cuisine from US history. I guess like fries and burgers and stuff :)
168,"Me too! Not much better than good old burgers and fries, though I do try to be health conscious most of the time."
169,For sure I didn't even that they existed
169,Well it sounds like you found an amazing partner! Do you see wedding bells in the future?
169,"I don't know, maybe shacking up for a trial period"
169,That sounds like a good idea! Do they have any cute friends that you could introduce me to?
169,She does have a few that are available
169,That's awesome! Maybe we should get dinner? What's your favorite type of food? Mine's Mexican!
169,Mexican sounds great but do not know of one in the area
169,I'm sure we could find one! Which Country do you live in?
169,"I hope it is the same as yours, Canada"
169,Yes! Canada as well. I'm in Manitoba. Which province? 
169,"Ah a bit far for a dinner date, I am in Quebec"
169,Just a little bit! Do you speak French?!
169,Yes I do 
170,It is truly amazing when you see that in person.
170,I'm really jealous. I can't go to ball games because I'm always looking after the kids.
170,Maybe you can have a nanny take care of the kids and we'll go to the ball game together.
170,Haha that's a good idea! Do you know a good nanny?
170,Yes. I would recommend my nanny to you. She helps when with my kids when I'm in school.
170,"Ahh great thank you! Ah I need to save up money so I can afford to go to the gym, I've gained a lot of weight recently!"
170,I need to train too. I've only been at work and school for writing recently.
170,What sort of writing do you hope to do in the future?
170,I would like to do fiction and explore the depths of imagination through my futuristic novels!
170,"Haha, depths of imagination sounds like something Oscar Wilde would say. Can't wait to read it!"
170,"lol. Also, I earn extra money by helping my local librarian sort books in the library. You do gigs?"
170,"No I don't. Wow, that must keep you busy!"
170,"Yes, and it keeps me motivated too. What do you like about Oscar Wilde?"
171,Yes it was! I can hardly believe it.
171,Wow! You must be an extremely lucky person! What are you going to spend it on?
171,Maybe on meatloaf. It's my favorite!
171,Haha $100 will get you a lot of meatloaf! What do you do for work?
171,I work at a school. How about you?
171,That's awesome good for you! I'm a psychiatric nurse. My husband is a teacher! Do you have kids? 
171,I have 7 kids. They are all over the place!
171,Wow! How do you keep track of so many! I have enough trouble with my two kids. 
171,"As long as I know where at least 4 are, the others can't be too far. Thank goodness for coffee."
171,Omg no kidding. You must need the whole pot! You must be a super parent!
171,A little alcohol in the coffee doesn't hurt.
171,Yes! I can't imagine dealing withou it haha. Did you celebrate Halloween yesterday!
172,"That is interesting, why toto?"
172,"My parents loved The Wizard of Oz, and so they named their company after the dog."
172,So your parents started the business and you have taken over?
172,"Yeah. They retired a few years ago, I'm the head of the company now."
172,Isn't there a band with the same name?
172,I think so. Wasn't it a pop group from California?
172,"Ya that is it, they were popular in the 80's"
172,Right. What kinds of music are you into?
172,I lean more to classic rock but enjoy all gendres
172,Nice. I'm going to a rock festival next month.
172,Awesome where is the festival going to be?
172,"Bridgetown, Barbados! My wife and I are very excited to go."
173,"Yeah, I love reading. It really helps me escape after a long day."
173,"yes i agree my friend . it has been nice chatting with you , too !"
173,Glad to hear it. What are your plans for the weekend?
173,movies are best escape for me and i need it .
173,Why? Are you very stressed in life?
173,no ! not at all i love to go to the movies to ease my mind
173,"Ah, I see. What is your favourite genre of movies?"
173,My favorite movie batman. And you?
173,"Batman is awesome, good choice. I really like Gladiator, with Russell Crow"
173,"yes , i totally agree ! great movie !"
173,"Do you like going to the cinema, or do you prefer watching movies at home?"
173,"It depends on the movie. Interestingly enough, I just heard a hip-hop song called  "
174,I'm trying to lose weight for my upcoming skiing competition! Do you do any sports? 
174,"Not, really. I just go to work in bicycle sometimes."
174,That's awesome! Great for both you and the environment! Where do you work?
174,I take care of kids at a family house. It is about 20 minutes in bicycle. 
174,That sounds like an awesome job! I love kids. Do you have any of your own or want any in the future?
174,I don´t  have any kids yet. But I want to some day. Do you have kids?
174,Yeah I have two kids! A one year old boy and a 3 year old girl. No regrets! What do you like to do for fun?
174,Those are great ages! I love outdoor activities in my big yard. I like BBQ and playing cards or just chilling in summer.
174,Oh man that sounds so nice! I'm looking out my window at the snow and missing summer. Do you live somewhere hot or do you get snow too?
174,"I get a lot of snow, Which I find interesting too, but also miss summer. Where do you live?"
174,"I live in Canada. I hate the cold, its unbearable! Where do you live? "
174,"Ohh. Haven´t you thought about moving? I live in West Virginia, USA."
175,"I got a job as an account, I've been here for three months now. I'm crushing it :-)"
175,Wow Congrats! I recently got a job as a radio host! I love it.
175,Interesting! what time of day do you work? 
175,Usually early mornings because that's when people are commuting to work. What about you?
175,that's the only time of day I listen to the radio! My hours are regular office hours. I am really enjoying my new gig. sounds like you are too? 
175,"Ahh so the typical 9-5? My husband is the same, but he usually works overtime by having to go to corporate dinners haha. Yeah I love it."
175,Yep exactly. Do you get lots of people calling in to your show? 
175,"Not usually, people only really call in for the competitions we run. "
175,ah ha. I've actually called in and won on radio shows before! do you get decent vacation time? 
175,"Really?! What did you win? Yeah, it's the standard amount you'd expect really, but every day feels like a holiday when you love your job :)"
175,"I totally agree! You gotta do what you love, find the right mix of people! I've won concert tickets!"
175,"Wow really? To see who? I recently went to see BTS live, that was absolutely amazing. I love any type of pop music haha."
175,I love live music! I've actually won concert tickets multiple times if you can believe that!
176,"Well, those are all numbers."
176,"that's true. in theory the numbers work, but you can only know for sure once the solar panels are installed."
176,I'd love to have the panels but math isn't my strong point.
176,maybe a qualified electrician in the field can help you crunch the numbers.
176,that would be most good.
176,"now, i need your advice. my mom is allergic to dogs and i've got two dogs as pets. how can i make my home inviting for mom?"
176,Can the dogs be put in another room when she visits?
176,"i do that already, though she still gets symptoms. maybe i can use solar power to power a uv allergen zapper."
176,Now that's a new idea! I love it.
176,"since we both would like to install panels, I think we should arrange for the same company to do the work."
176,Do you know anyone who's had it done? Someone who could offer recommendation?
176,"Yes, my brother had his whole house off grid with Green Solars Energy. Great company and affordable."
177,"I called my grandmother, who I am named after, she has a knack for finding things"
177,Which borough does she live in? There are five.
177,You mean in New York City?  Don't live there.  I am in the midwest
177,"Well anyway thanks for the offer, my son Owen is out trying to find them"
177,I am really not sure I understand what you mean.
177,"We live in New York and i don""t think your Grandmother can help"
177,"I agree, I don't think she can help.  Maybe a long walk around the mall and I will be able to find them"
177,That is a good idea
177,"Yes, amazinfg when you retrace your steps what you will find"
177,Maybe you go to the lost and found at the mall and see if any body found them 
177,that is a good idea!  Thank you.  I appreciate tyhe suggestion
177,You are quite welcome
178,Wow. That must be amazing. I am planning one with my boyfriend. Have you always had good experiences or any bad ones?
178,"we enjoy them...I know not everyone's cut out for cruises, but you should give one a try!"
178,yes. I am excited about it. What is the longest you have been in one?
178,"about 10 days, but we've mostly done one week cruises. I love the relaxation and getting time for mediation"
178,I see. 10 days sounds good enough!
178,"Oh, it's amazing! when we have more vacation time we might go for a two week one. We have stopped at lots of interesting places!"
178,Weren't you nervous the first time? I am sometimes scared of the see. LOL
178,I was a little scared of being seasick. but I brought some stuff along just in case. You should do that too. 
178,Ok. Thank you. I will definitely do that. 
178,what other kinds of vacations have you enjoyed? One of the best things about a cruise is there's something for everyone!
178,I love the beach. But I have gone there either in airplane or car. Mostly in car and it has been about 20 hours!
178,"I looooove long road trips. The beach is my happy place, btw! Nothing like relaxing w/toes in sand1"
179,"I listen to blues, mostly. I've been collecting blues years."
179,That's cool! Do you have any band reccomendations? I'm always looking for things to add to my spotify playlist. 
179,I definitely recommend checking out the work of B.B. King. Ever listened to him?
179,Nope. I've honestly never heard of him. I'm looking him up right now. What else do you like to do for fun?
179,"I like playing instruments. My friends and I recently started a garage band, that's been a lot of fun. What about you?"
179,That's so cool! What kind of music do you play? I like hanging out with my dog and playing video games. 
179,"Nice, what kinds of video games? I like video games too. My band and I mostly play classic rock. I'm on the bass guitar."
179,All of them! Right now I'm playing through Borderlands 3. It's a lot of fun! That's super cool. Do you perform ever or just play for fun?
179,"Borderlands 3, very cool.I was thinking of trying it. What character are you playing? And yeah, we mostly play weddings, honestly!"
179,I'm playing as FL4K! It's really buggy right now but its still awesome. That's super cool. Maybe I'll hire you to play mine one day!
179,"Nice, I was of playing FL4K too. I'm mostly absorbed by the new Modern Warfare lately though, haha. And that would be cool! Do you have a partner?"
179,What system do you play on? Yeah I have a boyfriend of almost 3 years. Do you have a partner? What country are you in?
179,I play on ps4. And cool! I got out a relationship about a month ago. I'm from Canada. And you?
179,"Oh no sorry to hear that! We have a ps4, xbox one, and switch between the two of us! I'm also in Canada - Manitoba."
179,"Oh, nice. I'm from BC. I come to Manitoba for the annual Ukrainian festival in Dauphin during the summers."
180,"wow, seems like you love concerts. I would like to join you on some of those."
180,it is nice whether u also love concerts 
180,"i love concerts, and i am always the one who buys beers for my friends. maybe you and me could link up?"
180,ok that nice
180,"lately i've been drinking too much beer; my beer gut is so big, haven't seen my feet in two years. lol."
180,eventhough you need to maintain some diet to control it
180,that's true. diet is very important. what do you think about becoming vegan?
180,it is very difficult for me to control my mouth
180,"I know, i can relate. pleasing the taste buds with healthy foods can be a challenge, though I'd risk and try a veggie burger. would you?"
180,yes it is healthy but it does take a lot of time . . . do you like music
180,i love all types of music. i use music to train at the gym and to relax at home. i'm sure you love live music too.
180,how long that ypur going to gym
180,i've been going to the gym for 6 months now and i'm starting to feel results.
181,Is your grandmother OK?
181,My grandmother is. She passed away 5 years ago. Now my mom is sick.
181,"so sorry, I thought you said grandmother -- not focused lately.  I am retiring in 6 months"
181,I know. Sadly she passed away from Alzheimer's. I hope my mom is not getting the same. She is much better now. But I have a lot to pay.
181,"yes, it can be very expensive.  I hope you all have good insurance"
181,"We do, but still a lot of bills. It is ok, health is important. That's why you need to be active! I used to run fast but I stopped."
181,"Agreed, I have studied ballet all my life to stay activbe"
181,"That is great. I like to watch ballet. It requires a lot of discipline, right?"
181,It sure does.  Alot of discipline and alot of practicve
181,I bet! If I ever have a girl I would love for her to practice ballet. 
181,"It is really great, almost meditative.  You have no children?"
181,No. I don't. But I would like to. Maybe in one or two years. What about you?
182,Really? I'd love to go there someday but doubt I'd be able to
182,"its the only think my father will drink,  since my birth."
182,I haven't drank much lately. How is your father?
182,"Wife is at work, and it's pretty hot out today.  Do you think I should invite him in and offer him some lemonade?"
182,Your father? You should invite him in
183,My job is a total deadend. Selling things no one wants. Literally the only good thing is that it's 9-5 w/no overtime
183,"I enjoy working with the public,do you?"
183,"I do, but I don't like feeling like I'm trying to scam people when selling them stuff...so I need to look for a new gig"
183,Well as a bank teller you don't scam people
183,right - maybe I should try that! do you need to have experience? 
183,Most teller jobs need experience with handling cash and a high school diploma. so you would have to have some expirience in the field
183,"ok I've done multiple retail jobs and I am def a hs graduate, plus I'm sick of sales. I'll look for openings"
183,well now most provide on-the-job training.so you will get all the training you need there
183,"sounds perfect! my other alternative would be working at Costco...after all, it's my favorite place to shop!"
183,I love going to Costco.
183,Me too! I need to head over there and check out some of their stuff for Christmas!
183,You should - it has something for everyone.
183,"Yep, I heard they already have the sleds out!"
184,Sounds like a good time! Toyota's are the best vehicles in my opinion. Very reliable. What else do you like to do for fun?
184,I do to university so fun is just having a break from work and going out clubbing hahaha. What about you?
184,I feel that on another level. I'm in my senior year of University. I just like to go for sushi with my partner when I can. What do you study?
184,"I literally got sushi the other day as a way of relieving stress after I'd finished my 3 hour seminar at 9am hahaha. I study business management, you?"
184,Oh wow good for you! That sounds like a tough course. I'm in psychiatric nursing! I love it!
184,"It's not tough, it's actually pretty easy! It is super boring though. That sounds so interesting woah, I'm jealous. Do you live in the US?"
184,No! I live in Canada. Where do you live?
184,I'm in England haha. It's so cold right now and my friends are refusing to turn on the heating in our student house so I'm freezing. How's Canada?
184,Omg! What's wrong with them? I hate being cold. Canada's alright. Starting to get cold here too. What's England like? I'd like to travel there!
185,I really miss flowers when I am deployed for long periods
185,"you are a soldier, serving our country?"
185,Yes and I really love serving for long periods of time
185,"i would like to know the address of your station/base to send you roses, my favorite flower, as an act of gratitude."
185,that is so kind of you.  I appreciate you.
185,I appreciate all the servicemen and servicewomen that care about our nation as you do. Does the military let you grow long hair?
185,"not sure what the exact standards, rules are"
185,"I ask because I am thinking of serving too, but my hair is long and brown and beautiful. I'd prefer to keep my hair long."
185,Maybe you could ask a recruiter.  Serving my county is one of my greatest joys
185,"Great idea. I know that all are great choices, but what branch of the military would you recommend?"
185,"I think the Coast Guard is the best, but many people rather the marines"
185,My brother served in the Coast Guard and he really enjoyed helping with rescue missions in Alaska.
186,I only speak english
186,what kind of music do you like? I listen to a lot of blues...and I love live music
186,"I listen to all kinds of music, my girlfriend and I used to go out quite a bit to live shows, just not so much anymore"
186,"Yep, I find as I'm getting older that the live music timeframe doesn't work as well...I want to go to bed earlier sometimes"
186,"For sure, sleeping is easier than dealing with other people sometimes"
186,I'm tired easier...and it's harder for me to sleep in. boo hoo. not like when I could easily sleep til 10!
186,That's definitely a hard part of getting older!
186,totally. what kind of movies do you like? I even fall asleep at the movies sometimes now
186,I love John Grisham movies and anything like it
186,I have read a bunch of his books - I can't put them down. His movies are good too!
186,"Personally, I prefer the movies over his books. Do you read a lot?"
186,"Yes, I love to read. I wish I had more time to read. I mostly get books from the library - what about you? "
186,"Me too, I love the library. Gives me a chance to get out of the house and have some alone time"
187,yes.obviosly.they are good for health
187,I use some Mexican herbs too. Where do you get yours from? Order online?
187,no I buy herbs freshly on grocery stores
187,That's great. Fresh is always a better option.
187,Yes I always prefer a fresh one
187,Sometimes I grow my own herbs
187,that very nice.do you own a land
187,"No, I grow them indoors"
187,that's great idea
187,It can save you some money. Have you ever tried?
187,I decided to own a land and grow a herb ito it
187,It's nice to have a land. You are more independent then.
188,I play a lot of video games. I actually am a game designer so I get to play them for a living. Best job ever. Do you play games?
188,"Yes, I started playing after my father passed away "
188,I'm so sorry to hear that. Which games do you play? Did they help you cope at all?
188,"I like to play solo games like solitare, majng tiles"
188,Oh yeah those are fun. What else do you like to do for fun?
188,"watch alot of tv, have to stay inside because of my alergies"
188,What are you allergic to?
188,"all kinds of pollens, animals, ragweed, you name it, I am alergiv"
188,Oh noo that's horrible. Do you have minor symptoms or go into major anaphylactic shock?
188,It is like and infection in the brain.  It came on pretty sudden though.
188,Really? Did they say what caused that? When did that happen?
188,Just my allergies
189,Moving across the city so at least it isn't too far. I don't have a car which will make it difficult but I'm really excited.
189,"Well, moving into a new house is a great feeling.  Good for you.  Have you always lived in the city?"
189,"Yes, we've been in the same house for the past 10 years but decided to move to a bigger house to start a family."
189,"You'll need a bigger house for that, for sure!  I did the same many years back when we had our 2nd child.  Good decision."
189,That's great to hear! How many children do you have?
189,We have 3 now and that's plenty!  Two are already off to college and the youngest opted for trade school.  The house seems a little bigger now.
189,"I can see how it might feel that way, but at least you have raised your children well and I'm sure they will have successful careers!"
190,I love beer! I love trying out new beers.
190,"Yeah, I can't drink it and drive my moped"
191,yes most of the people play gambling
191,I don't really like gambling
192,"I have to get up early too, I wish I had time to nap."
192,Exactly. It is often a time where you can get work done or just rest.
192,Yes for sure! What are you taking in school?
192,Well I'm in high school so I'm just taking the normal required classes in order to graduate.
192,"Oh that makes sense, what's your favorite class? I always liked Biology."
192,I really liked chemistry because it allowed me to really try and understand life at a small level.
192,"I never actually took chemistry, but that is very interesting to know. Are you graduating this year?"
192,"Yes, I will be graduating in May."
192,Oh that's fantastic! What are your plans after graduation?
192,I'm going to study School Psychology!
192,That's a good field to get into.
192,Yes it is! I'm very excited to start college.
193,one week ago
193,And how do you like your new place so far?
193,I like it very much
193,"That is great, congratulations on the new place. Is it away from your old one?"
193,yes little much distance from my old place.But I like the old place very much than this plce
193,I hope you'll like it more eventually
193,Hope!.I am also think of it
193,"I'll be moving out soon, too"
193,really!
193,"Yes, I already found a new place. It's really cool!"
193,where was it?
193,The south side of the city
194,"oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you get a tutor/study partner?"
194,I could but it all comes down to yourself. I am very interested in ecology and nature but it is not my strength
194,"Yeah that's true, I'm sure that if you try really hard you'll succeed! Just do your best."
194,"Thanks, I am trying my hardest but I continue to fail my courses. I have to retake many courses but that is costly. "
194,"I understand, it can definitely be costly. There are a lot of resources out there for students, do you think you could get some student aid?"
194,Student aid will only compound the debt. How about you? Are you struggling financially too?
194,"Yes, I just lost my job and am unemployed. I don't know how I'm going to pay my bills this month."
194,are you single and living alone or raising a family?
194,"I have a daughter, I give her everything I have"
194,like a good father does. That is lovely and I am sure she appreciates your efforts. 
194,"Yes, it's pretty hard sometimes but shes my little princess. I do my best to give her a great life."
194,we can only do our best
195,"Well, All 6 of them are between 6 and 15"
195,Great ages to have lots of fun with.
195,"Exactly, and here in Alabama....there's plenty of fun to go around"
195,"Especially in the capital, Montgomery!  One of the state pastimes of Alabama is getting drunk in the street."
195,Hell yeah. I remember my last Crimson Tide game. I got so drunk I couldn't even recognize my wife my from daughter.
195,I am going to the University of michigan and it is a regular occurence
195,"Ah, Michigan. I remember when the Tide played them. Think they blew them out. "
195,Yes but the choked like usual.
195,"Only against Clemson it seems. Well, and Aubrn"
195,Hey well at least they didn't do too bad last year
195,"No, and this year"
195,The season is early and lots can happen
196,Do you like to read the encyclopedia?
196,Yes! I also enjoy visiting museums with my two sons. What about you?
196,I don't really live close to any museums but I would love to go to one some day.
196,"Ah, I hope you're able to visit some soon. What do you do to pass the time?"
196,I tend to work a lot but in my spare time I do like to read.
196,"I also read occasionally, usually to my children. What genre do you like to read?"
196,I like to read romance books. I also like to read to my son as well.
196,"Romance novels are nice, it's a shame real life doesn't usually pan out like a romance novel."
196,"I know, I wish that it would because everyone would be living the good life then. Haha!"
196,"That is true! At least we can read about it in books, that's the second best thing to actually living it."
196,"Yes, I really enjoy to read that genre of books because it really helps me imagine the scenario "
196,I agree. The best thing about summer is that I can read my mystery novels outside in the sun. Do you like mystery books?
197,oh no. I don't.
197,"yeah, I can be pretty gross. How old is your son?"
197,He is 4. Do you have kids?
197,No i do not. But i wish someday after getting married i will have my own. 
197,That is nice. having kids in marriage. It is sad when marriage is broken though. like my parents.
197,My parents got divorced when I was 12. It was very stressful.
197,"it is. I was already old, but I have a 15 year old sister, and yes. It was so hard for her, for me too though."
197,"I can imagine. It was very hard for me and my brothers, It was very sad to see my dad not live with us anymore."
197,"I must be so difficult. I was already married, but my sister was still with them. She got crazy."
197,I'm sorry to hear that. Is she doing better now?
197,"She is. She was living with me right after that, so that helped. She left my house a few weeks ago. "
197,Is she living on her own now?
198,No I haven't had the time either. The kids and work take up most of my time!
198,Karate would have been interesting to take. I wish I could have made time for it.
198,I wish I could have too. Maybe we will have more time in the future.
198,I hope so. It would be good skills to learn.
198,Yes it would. I wonder if we could take classes online for it? Maybe watch YouTube videos?
198,That's an awesome suggestion! I have never thought about that before. I might have to google that to see what I can find.
198,I will look into it as well. You can find almost anything is online these days!
198,That's true. I feel like I rely on the internet too much sometimes. Haha!
198,"As do I, but I don't know if I would have it any other way. Having all that info at your fingertips is amazing!"
198,I know.. I pretty much use it in a daily basis for basically everything!! 
198,"Me too. I feel like I'm missing a part of myself if I don't have my phone on me. And since I've had kids, it just feels safer having one."
198,I know.. I have a kid myself so I always make sure that I have my phone on me no matter what
199,I know! or basketball...or maybe some other kind of team!
199,"Yup, I guess it depends on what sports your kids like. "
199,or maybe they won't like sports at all...you never know! We might end up with an artist!
199,You never know! Hopefully they don't turn out like me... I'm a recovering alcoholic and I was living in a storage locker for two months.
199,that sounds rough. Are things looking up for you now? Are you going to AA?
199,"Yes, I'm attending AA every Sunday. Luckily I'm in an apartment now too, things are finally starting to go my way."
199,That's great...I was going to ask about your living situation. It must feel good to be in your own place. 
199,"Yes, it's so nice to be able to have somewhere to come relax."
199,"oh, I bet! and I'm guessing the heating/ac was not great in the storage locker? How is your job going? "
199,"It was always freezing! It's going good, I'm working the night shift at a gas station right now. What about you?"
199,"actually I have to be on bed rest right now, for my health and the babies. So I'm not working right now. "
199,"Ah, I hope you enjoy your time not working. How long will you be on bed rest for?"
199,"Five months for my bed rest. So, that's a lot of reading! It actually gets a little boring. "
200,Have you ever seen a stamp with a dragon on it?  They are hard to come by but sometimes you get lucky!
200,"oh that sounds cool! I wish i had one, dragons are awesome I collect anything with dragons on them"
200,What's the coolest dragon collection item you have?  Dragons are really cool but I feel like it would hard to find collectibles for them.
200,I love small figures and paintings 
201,Yes it is quite different but they realy are fast
201,"Yes, I have played fast pitch softball...pitching gets really tiring though. I love playing softball and I watch a lot of sports too. "
201,Ya I like to sit down with a bowl of jelly beans a watch a game
201,so you don't go for the chips or pretzels? I want to come watch a game at your place!
201,Ya I know it is different but hey come on over and try it out
201,"What sports do you play? I know I told you I love softball, I love basketball too"
201,Mostly basketball and volleyball and some tennis
201,I tried skiing too but it wasn't for me. what else do you do for fun? 
201,I like to play music
201,"I love listening to music, not so much playing it...what instruments do you play? "
201,I play the guitar and banjo
201,"that sounds awesome. I really like the sound of the banjo. I was thinking of trying to play the ukelele, I like that sound too."
202,i have 2 dogs
202,"That's so cool! I have a shih tzu and a poodle, What breeds are your dogs?"
202,I have a Chihuaha-Dachshund mix and a husky
202,"Oh, I love huskies! They are very intelligent. Are you thinking about getting any more dogs?"
202,I'd love to but I don't know if my boyfriend will let me yet. Are you going to get more?
202,"Probably not, because my husband works in sales and is always away. I would need a lot of help with a new one."
202,"same here, they can be quite a handful!"
202,What does your boyfriend do for a living?
202,"He works with computers, building them"
202,That's interesting! I'm sure he's a very smart guy. I can barely figure out how to get onto the internet.
202,same here! I'm clueless about technology. 
202,So I assume you are in a different line of work than your boyfriend. Yes?
203,It was...I struggled for a long time. Getting better now. Did you have anything similar happen? 
203,"Yeah, but it got better over time"
203,"You know what they say, time heals all wounds. I think that's true, it's just that sometimes it's a LOT of time"
203,I agree. some things take longer than others to get over.
203,"Yes, I'm trying to look towards the future now. I'm trying meditation and it does help. What will you do for the holidays? "
203,Meditation is cool. I've tried it a few times. I'm not sure yet. Hopefully nothing.
203,I'm planning to spend as much time as possible with my family. Those are the best times for me. /
203,How sweet. I am not close to my family. I always enjoy seeing people having good family time.
203,"Well, then I hope you get a lot of time to relax and chill. Seen any good movies lately? "
203,Not particularly. I am not a big movie watcher. Do you enjoy movies?
203,I prefer reading but I do watch some movies once in a while. What do you do for fun? 
203,I love to read. I mainly just like playing video games and drinking a little beer on the weekends.
203,"Yes, I am for sure a regular at the local library!"
204,but what if there is a security issue and I'm off helping someone find a product? that could be a really bad situation.
204,Do they not have enough security staff available so that you can help customers?
204,It's not my job to help customers. I am the only security person.
204,"That is true! I think you're in the right here, clearly. What sort of job would you like to do if this does not work out?"
204,"I honestly love security, I'm a really big guy, 250lbs and really muscular, maybe I'll become a bouncer. "
204,Would you have a day job as well if you became a bouncer or security guard that works at night?
204,probably just spend more time with my dogs. what do you do?
204,"I am currently a student, but I am working towards my dream of becoming a fashion designer."
204,oh that sounds exciting! 
204,Yeah! I would like to create a more affordable stylish brand that looks similar to LV or Gucci.
204,I like that idea. Even though i'ma big guy i really like fashion
204,I was going to say something earlier but maybe you could be a model for my future stuff! You did say you're big and muscular.
205,I think daycares are underrated. They let kids have so much expression and creativity and the employees should be paid more for that.
205,Yes I agree most daycare workers are underpaid it's a very difficult job 
205,Agreed! Kids require patience that it seems like many of us don't have.
205,another thing I think that can be under estmiated is the fact that a lot of kids come from broken homes and have emotional trouble
205,"Exactly! Its heart breaking, and i hope daycares are well aware of that when some kids acta certain way."
205,"maybe it would help if they had some type of music program, I always found music relaxing and love all types, do You like music?"
205,Interesting suggestion! I absolutely LOVE music. What genre would you suggest would help?
205,I think every genere can help in some way I would love to teach both a mix of clasical and indie mixed togeter like radiohead mixed with mozart
205,Fair point. I personally haven't indulged in indie music but now you've got me interested!
205,"Lol that's cool radiohead is one of my fav, what are some of your fav bands."
205,I like this R&B and soul band called the internet. I have a thing for the R&B era! How about you?
205,"I like the old shool R&B like Aaliyah, Timberland, Usher, and such It's been great talking to You"
206,Pushing yourself to do better is always a good idea! Sometimes I honestly feel like I push myself too often.
206,It can be really hard. Nobody should push themselves too hard. It can be stressful.
206,Well when someone focuses on perfectionism they don't really take into account its affects.
206,I agree. Also very hard on the perfectionist person. Hard for them to accept if they don't make their goals.
206,"Very true, they treat it like it's the end of the world."
206,I agree.  Do you set any goals for yourself?
206,Yes absolutely. Sometimes I believe my goals are too strict or hard to reach.
206,What kind of goals do you set? Like for work or what?
206,I set goals around my work and school. With school I force myself to shoot for the stars and I have to follow every regulation at work.
206,My daughter just graduated top of her class. She knows what that is like. She is a perfectionist too
206,Are you calling me a perfectionist? How could you tell?
206,No my daughter. She just graduated high school with honors
207,"I do, but not much anymore. Do you?"
207,"I used to have a dirt bike, but don't anymore either. Some of my family ride in groups and events."
207,Why did you stop cycling?
207,Mountain biking accident. Couldn't afford to replace my bike afterwards.
207,Oh no! That's awful. Did you get hurt in the accident?
207, Only my pride was hurt. I have a friend who does some tests to show riding skills and I tried to copy her. It didn't work out so well.
207,Oof! What a bummer. Hopefully your pride has recovered since then. :)
207,"Mostly recovered. I don't think I'll be trying to show off like that again, though!"
207,I don't blame you one bit. Do you have any other hobbies to take its place?
207,I take time on the weekends to hike up in Canada. The views up there are great.
207,"Oh wow. I've never been, but I'd like to go one day. Friends who have traveled there absolutely love it."
207,Yeah you should go! Or to any lake/camping area near where you live. You would have a great time too!
208,I wish I could draw tattoos!
208,"It's definitely an art to get good at tattooing, you can't exactly go back and erase a mistake when it's permanent! "
208,I know and that's why you need to find a really good artist to get your tattoo done
208,What would you say is your best way of finding a really good tattoo artist? I am a designer myself but I don't know anyone who tattoos professionally.
208,I have an artist who's been doing tattoos for me for years now
208,"Cool! I really love how tattooing is becoming more acceptable recently, although I'm not brave enough to get one myself. Does it hurt getting one?"
208,"Yes, little bit but it's worth it!"
208,Have you ever tried designing one yourself? I have been considering it as there seems to be quite a lot of demand for original tattoo designs.
208,You're right! I never tried myself but I thing you should definitelly go for it!
208,I'd love to but I'd be too worried that someone wouldn't like my design. Can you imagine if someone said they didn't like it after the tattoo was already finished?
208,that would be hard!
208,"Luckily I think tattoo removals have become pretty advanced these days, a bad drawing has to be better than getting another persons name tattooed on you though!"
209,Cool that's nice I love dogs and want to get another A dobermin
209,"I love dobermans, they are good dogs. I have to go to work soon. What are you up to tonight?"
209,I am just relaxing going to make dinner in a little some pork chops have You ate?
209,"No i havent, Im starving lol pork chops sound yummy"
209,"Yep I think I'm going to go to the beach the weekend so that should be relaxing I hope I love to travel, any plans this weekend?"
209,I am probably gonna stay home this weekend and take it easy. Me and my collie will go get some doggy biscuits
209,Sounds good any upcoming Tv shows you like coming up
209,"Yeah, I like stranger things, I've really been wanting to watch Black Mirror. Have you seen it?"
209,"Black Mirror is My Fav show on NF I absoulutly love it, My fav ep Fifteen Million Merits have you seen it"
209,No but i've been dying to check it out.
209,It's great and a cool thing is You can watch in any order as they are all diffrent
209,Awesome. Id love to check it out I saw a clip of one where people had social ratings
210,"Well, my mother might be some that believes that... she has 500 pairs of shoes for crying out loud!"
210,Oh wow. What does she say she wants with all those shoes?
210,She just tells me that she can't give them up because he thinks that something awful will happen to me if she does.
210,"Are they her shoes, or did they used to be yours? That seems a little odd!"
210,They're shoes that she sees and buys. There are some that used to be mine or my fathers but most are just shoes that she sees at stores.
210,"Huh, interesting. But she thinks something bad will happen to you if she gives up the shoes? Bad like what?"
210,"I'm allergic to a lot of different things like shellfish, cats, etc. So something like I'll get scratched by a cat and die. Who knows!"
210,"Well, I guess moms will mom as they want! Hahaha. Is her house really cluttered with all those shoes?"
210,"No, I have ""left the nest"" as they say. My father and mother both live in the town I grew up in."
210,"Good for you. :) Life happened to me in a pretty rough way, so I'm currently in my folks' basement...but it's a place!"
210,Hey at least you have your family close by! What happened if you don't mind me asking?
210,"My roommate committed suicide two years ago, and I couldn't make the bills without her. But my parents let me save money, so I'm glad for them."
211,That's so great you can be there for them I have found that having family and friends near can really help
211,I agree. Its always good to have a support system
211,Yep I don't have many friends but I do have a somewhat major friend who actully controls many things
211,What do you mean by controls? and I mainly just have my pets
211,Well my friend actully runs the world and we even have the fav singer ke ha do You like music?
211,Yes I do. I love all kinds of music.
211,"Cool same, have you eaten dinner Yet? I'm going to make pork chops tonight"
211,Yum that sounds delicious. I am currently eating a bowl of microwave ravioli
211,"Nice, I love animals, what kind of pets do You have?"
211,I have a cat named Saturn. I rescued her from in the woods when she was a kitten. Do you play any computer games?
211,"Awww that's so nice, I play chess what about You?"
211,Awesome. I love Chess. I play all kinds of games though. I also like Blackjack and Poker
211,Take care
211,"Thanks, you too!"
212,What is your opinion about it?
212,I think it's strange how they managed to create a poodle from so many mixes of different crosses of dogs. I personally don't like the look of them though
212,Me either. what is your favorite breed of dog?
212,"My favourite breed is probably Husky because of how big they get, although I'm not a fan of how much fur they shed. What's your favourite breed?"
212,Probably a pit bull because I have one lol. Are you more of a dog or cat person?
212,"I used to prefer dogs the most but I have recently started to like cats more, not sure why lol. What's your dog called?"
212,Her name is Char. Do you have a cat or dog?
212,I used to have a cat when I was younger which is probably why I prefer them now. My parents have a dog but I don't see him much sadly.
212,I also have cats.What is your favorite food?
212,My favourite food is pretty much anything you can put on a pizza. What about yourself?
212,"Pizza is up there, but I love sushi! Do you like it?"
212,Sushi is pretty good although I don't eat seafood so I pretty much just stick to anything with veggies in it
213,"Yeah, it's a really good idea with all the floods happening on the coast. And likewise! Do you have to go?"
213,"No I dont have to go now, it was nice talking to you when I saw you at the grocery store"
213,"Oh, yes! I remember now. It was great to catch up. :) How'd your dinner go?"
213,"It went great, that new restaurant in town is fantastic but I had to take a walk after such a good meal"
213,I wish I could walk after a good meal. Normally I have to nap instead!
213,"Haha, sounds like you're my new cat, she always naps after she eats"
213,I love cats! I have five of them. Is she your only one?
213,"Yeah, we're only allowed one pet at the apartment we're at. Eventually we'd get another"
213,We started off with two because I convinced my husband that kittens go better in pairs. :) The rest are coincidental! How old is your kitty?
213,"Shes just a couple months! We got her as a rescue, someone had abandoned her"
213,Oh nooo poor baby! Good on you for taking her in! They're so much fun (but also big buttheads) at that age. What color is she?
213,"She's a calico, she is too cute, I need to show you some pictures!"
214,Yes. Really stressful. I don't want to mess up
214,I'm sure if You study and take is serious like You are You will do Great I Myself have a upcoming test in this college math class

214,"Not yet prob eat some pork chops in a little with some relaxing music, then watch some Netflix "
214,Awesome. Sounds yummy. Yeah I cant wait to relax and enjoy my weekend. Do you have any plans?
214,"I might go to the beach this weekend as is so nice out, what about You?"
214,I will probably stay home and work on my garden. Do you grow anything?
214,"I love garden's although I don't have one myself but I do have a tommoto tree, what do You grow"
214,Awesome. I love to grow veggies as well as flowers. I grew some great pumpkins this year

215,"Nice I would like to have a simple life to just a nice relaxing home with alot of space to myself, "
215,No plans on finding someone and settling down?
215,"A simple life would be great, hard for me to find somone as I offten wonder why I'm here and what it's like to be a diffrent gender"
215,Why do you think you're here? To make an impact?
215,One day I know I will make a impact it's just hard right now as I'm worried My parrents won't understand
215,What do they not understand?
215,Well I haven't told them that I offten wonder what it would be like to be a different gender
215,I think if one of my kids was wondering what it's like to be a different gender I would want them to tell me and talk about it.
215,"Thanks one day I will, any plans for this weekend, I'm heading to the beach myself"
215,Hopefully my husband and I will be going out on a date this weekend... If we can find a babysitter for tomorrow.

218,"No, I didn't have any notes. Next time I'll be sure to write something down."
218,Writing stuff down is a great way to remember what you want to say. How was your day other than that?
218,My day was pretty good. After the speech there wasn;t much to do at work. How about your day?
218,It was okay. Just boring. Cant wait to get home and read. What do you like to do in your free time

219,"I don't play myself, but my son is good and is teaching my grandson. He's probably better than me lol"

219,It's so nice when families keep things like that going. Do you have any other hobbies?
219,"Oh yes, I draw. I've been doing that since I moved to the US."
219,"I draw also! And I bake. Don't have much of a sweet tooth so most of it goes to my kids, but I like doing it"
219,Oh awesome! do any of your kids have the same passion for drawing?
219,One does. Do you have any kids?
219,None that I know of. Haha! I wish I could get into baking but I'm afraid I'm too old to learn at this point in my life.
219,"Oh no, baking is easy. If you can follow directions, you can bake lol"
219,"That's what everyone says, but I've tried and it always comes out burnt or severely underdone."
219,Well I suppose there is a learning curve. Bread is probably best to start with

222,"All sorts, it depends on my mood that day."

223,Just looking to buy something on AZ to help my mom who takes care of mygrandmother these days good luck at the game

223,I work online so I Have plenty of time to find the right gift as I'm already on the computer all day lol
223,"Haha that's true, what are you thinking of buying?"
223,"A neck messager but I wan't to make sure I find a good one, do You have any hobbies? I love chess Myself"

223,"Will check them out, Thanks take care:)"
224,I didn't realize dentistry went back that far?
224,Yup! In fact I have heard archaeologists have discovered mummified ancients with metal bands wrapped around individual teeth
224,I wonder how they were able to do that fine of metalwork thousands of years ago?
224,Beats me... the only reason I know this is because I've been doing a lot of research in hopes I can convince my mom that I shouldn't get braces.
224,"LOL! I didn't get braces when I was a kid, but I should have. You may not like them now, but it will definitely be worth it years later."
224,"Yes, but I suppose it's worth it in the long run.  But I hate the idea of having metal in my mouth."
224,"There are new braces that are clear plastic that you wear at night, they make new ones as your teeth get realigned"
224,I wonder if those would also help stop food getting between your teeth.
224,"They might as they cover the teeth, but you mostly wear them while you are sleeping."
224,I didn't know if you wore them during the day while you. I tend to be eating all the time. I probably need to stop eating so much.
224,Friends that had regular braces did have to watch a lot of what they ate and had to cut some things out.
224,I don't think my mom would let me get the clear braces you're talking about. Probably just to embarrass me.
225,A little but I kept calm I know she did not mean to
225,"That's good animals are still a little wild lol, probably gonna go for a run in a little get my 2 miles in I do everyday then cook dinner"
225,"Awesome I wish I could be more active. I spend most of my free time making crafts, like macaroni art."
225,That's cool I sometimes make crafts at work at the candy store I work it with the candy lol do You have any hobbies?
225,I also collect rocks. That must be really cool working at the candy store!
225,"What kind of rocks, Yeah I love the smell the most everyday it's relaxing lol"
225,"I bet lol. and different ones that catch my eye, like white quartz or anything unique looking"
225,"Cool I love the way diffrent rocks can have amzing gem like quality's to them, have You eatten dinner yet going to make pork chops tonight lol"
225,I ate a microwave meal earlier. Pork chops sounds delicious. 
225,"Cool, any plans for the weekend I might go to the beach and try to get some sun lol"
225,That sounds cool. I will probably just hang out at home. 
225,"Nice and cool inside any Tv shows you want to catch up on, I can't wait for Sunday and watch Power"
226,I haven't heard of Questlove before? What's that?
226,slowed down on watching it to much these days as I find Immy Fallon somewhat fake but I tune in for the occasional episode member of the band the roots
226,I was much more a fan of The Tonight Show when Johnny Carson was on it. The hosts nowadays just aren't in the same league.
226,"True, I have to go to the eye doctor soon to get some more contacts this saturday but then sunday going to the beach, what about You?"
226,"Cold weather has really hit here, snow flurries with a good frost each morning, so now my indoor hobbies are picking up"
226,"Good time to catch up on some tv Gonna cook pork chops tonight, got premaid rice in the bag but I have to take out the carrots lol"
226,"I have some leftover ring sausage and yams to finish off tonight, probably will toss some tater tots in the toaster oven as well"

226,"You also. I do like older shows and just finished watching all four seasons of Route 66, definitely a really good show from the early 60s."
226,I'll have to check it out
227,I really like Justin Bieber.  
227,"I have a hard time getting into modern music, I like music from the 60s and 70s"
227,"Yeah, that music is enjoyable as well.  I love the old music videos."
227,"Life was simpler back then. I grew up on cartoons like the Flintstones, these Japanese cartoons are different, but interesting"
227,I agree.  I can't say that I am a fan.  
227,Do you see any of the cartoons that come in the theaters nowadays? Some have been good.
227,"Yes, some have been very good! i have really enjoyed them!"
227,"I know kids will always want to go see them, but I wonder how much more life they will have in the theaters as they make so many?"
227,I wish kids would get outside and maybe do horse back riding. I really enjoy that!
227,"Unfortunately I never got to go horseback riding. But as kids, we were always out riding our bikes or playing ball"
227,It is a really fun activity to experience. I recommend it highly.
227,It's on my bucket list of things to try. A friend I used to work with had a daughter who owned a horse.
228,You like to cook right? Any tips for someone who doesn't cook often but wants to start doing so?
228,I'd say get a good cooking book or search up simple recipes on youtube.
228,I'm on a tight budget so I guess I'll like at videos on youtube. Any good recipes you would recommend? 
228,"Fair enough, I can relate as a student haha. I really like asian food, anything with rice. So maybe fried rice is a good start."
228,"Thanks, that's a really good idea. It's pretty cheap and I can almost whatever meats I want to it."
228,"yeah exactly, and it's good to use up vegetables that are about to go bad too."
228,That would be true if I ate vegetables haha. I really need to start eating healthier.  
228,"Same here, I need to join the gym too. If only it wasn't so expensive :("
228,There's plenty of cardio exercises you can do at home that don't take long.
228,It's difficult to exercise in my house because I live in university accommodation and my room is super small unfortunately.
228,I didn't know professors could live on campus. Well you could try the campus gym.
228,The university provides me accommodation for a reasonable price. We get discounts for the gym it's still quite expensive. I might take up running instead.
229,music festivals give a similar feeling to when your grinding a good rail
229,I think its better when you are doing something you like so I think Im gonna love it
229,What kind of music festival would you want to go to?
229,The Creamfields dance music festival. They have the best live acts.
229,That sounds pretty cool! What type of music do people dance to there?
229,"All kinds really, but mostly EDM and techno."
229,So it's kind of like a rave?
229,"Kind of like a rave yeah, except it's not as dark and there's more of a mix of music."
229,That's cool. What do you do for a living
229,"I work with HVAC equipment, but had an injury last week, so I'm off right now, what about you?"
229,I used to be a pro skater but I've had too many injuries so now I'm a dental assistant 
229,Pro skater to dental assistant? That's quite the change!
230,they can see how you really feel
230,I look people in the forehead when I sing karaoke. It's less scary
230,I sing in the shower sometimes
230,Me too. It's easy when you don't have anyone but yourself to impress!
230,And the acoustics are always spot on!
230,"I do prefer to do it out with friends than be alone, though"
230,"You know, I really like to play games with my friends!"
230,What games do you all play?
230,"All kinds of games. Mario games, shooter games, especially Halo 3."
230,I love Mario games! We should play together sometime
230,I really like mario kart and mario party. How about you? Which is your favorite?
230,Mario Kart is the best! I'm a terrible driver though!
230,I used to play mario kart double dash on the gamecube all the time
231,There's also the element of viewing in public. You can't always see as well as on the TV
231,One of my favorite things to watch live is a good chess match. It moves slow but when you see it play out it's amazing
231,I don't find that many young people my age like chess
231,Do you play yourself?
231,I do not. I like outdoor things - like running.
231,Oh man I love hiking myself. To see the natural beauty of the Earth is a wonder to experience!
231,It's so relaxing to just take it all in!
231,"it's also a good example of a lot of things in life. You have to work hard to get to where you want to go, but the reward is priceless."
231,The journey may be hard and long but the destination is worth it!
231,That's so true! it's hard sometimes though. You can get stuck on the journey and not know what to do or where to go. 
231,It happens to all of us...just keep going!
231,you are right ! thanks for chatting with me ! and good luck !
232,That's true! That's why I try to be a confidant to my former students that I still see
232,What do you teach?
232,I teach high school. What do you do?
232,"I work in the business world as a financial chief. It's taken a lot of work, but I'm glad to be where I am."
232,What do you do to relax? That sounds stressful!
232,"It was for a long time, but being in charge helps. I delegate a lot to others now."
232,I take walks when I've had a hard day.
232,Walks are nice. I try to call one of my friends who doesn't live in town.
232,That's great you have someone to vent to!
232,thanks! you could vent to me if you needed to.

234,Did you have a fever?
234,no. I just felt bad.
234,did you get a chance to rest and feel better?
234,Yes but it's hard for me. I never sit still!
234,"yeah, it's hard for me to sit still unless i'm way to into something on netflix "

234,"last show I watched was Black Adder, was my fav as a kid, you?"

236,I love my job. It's not easy but I enjoy being around kids. What do you study?
236,"I am studying economics, but I am thinking of changing my major to computer science since there are more job opportunities in this field nowadays. What do you teach? "

237,I do enjoy doing work writing but I wish that it paid more. I have to work a lot to make ends meet.
237,I hear you! Have you thought about starting a side business?
237,I've considered starting a side businees writing papers for students
237,"Ah, the good ole side hustle. I like that. You should check out "
237,I should check out what?
237,"Improve your planning, communication, and research skills."
237,How can I improve those things?
237,reserch thay have a lot of learning. and its free
237,Are you talking about a website? You never said.
237,yes. but a good one . not a scam. you have to wach for them.
238,I think it's more economic too
238,"Yes and no. While many people save money from not buying meat, supplementing the vitamins and protein meat gives you can be expensive."
238,I don't think you need to take supplements as a vegetarian. Have you ever tried skipping meat?
238,"There are some things you can't get from vegetables alone. I might consider going vegetarian, it's just skipping meat."
238,It might not be easy at first but there are many interesting veggie options out there. 
238,What interests me is veggie versions of meat products. I really want to try the impossible whopper.
238,I've never tried that one but it sounds yummy
238,"I've heard good things about it. I love the taste of meat so I am really interested in things like that, would make going vegetarian easier."
238,For sure. Going vegetarian is so much easier than vegan. I couldn't leave without cheese!
238,"I agree, I would give up if I couldn't have any cheese."
238,Me too! And what do you think about gluten-free diet?
238,"Well, I don't think it's necessary if you don't have a gluten allergy or celiac's disease. I've heard it can lower blood sugar for diabetics though."
239,"Yes! I LOVE under the bridge, and i also love it when they improvise they make it even better "
239,They are awesome. I was so impressed how good they were live. I didn't think listening to them live was better than with my headphones!
239,"I see, it's a personal preference thing I guess"
239,"yes , of course ! have you ever been to a concert ?"
239,"Yes I went to the red hot chilli peppers concert in Egypt, next to the pyramids and stuff "
239,"Wow, I didn't know that! Did you have a good time?"
239,"Yes I had an amazing time, since they're my favorite band, Best concert ever "
239,"It's good to hear they were good live, that can't be said about every group."
239,"Unfortunately, Metallica is great but live they're not that good"
239,I enjoy listening to Metallica while playing video games. Are you a fan of video games?
239,"Yes of course, my favorite game is destiny, I love that franchise"
239,I have never played Destiny. I heard mixed reviews about it. But I'm sure it is not as bad as eating broccoli!
239,Eating broccoli is only bad if it has GMOs
240,Parrots are really friendly.
240,They are friendly and cute!
240,Indeed.
240,Most parrots seem to be concentrated in the continents of South America and the islands between Australia and Asia.
240,"Yes, but those are the wild ones. The domesticated ones tend to live with humans."
240,"yes indeed, but do the domesticated ones hibernate during winter?"
240,"eh, depends on the breed"
240,Really? I personally hibernate in every season haha
240,lol
240,Do you watch basketball?
240,Occasionally...
240,"i am so glad the NBA season just started, who are you rooting?"
241,It is a movie that takes place in California. I like it cause I live on the coast like in the movie.
241,"Oh how nice, my mom likes coasts too, but she's too busy"
241,Glad she enjoys it on the coast! What is she busy with?
241,my mom looks after my grandmother
241,That is nice of her. My mom does the same. My grandmother has health issues and switched to a Vegan diet. I went vegan in support of her health.
241,"How nice! I am on a see food diet :/, but i always text my mom and apparently they're starting a plant based diet"
241,Switching to a plant based diet could greatly help reduce an individual's carbon footprint.
241,"Yes, since the top producer of CO2 is cow farm and the 6th i think are chicken farms"
241,So true. Happy to hear your family is trying to get on board with the idea.
241,"yes , but i am thinking of moving to the west coast soon . . . do you like california ?"
241,It is enjoyable but has some problems. I have never visited the west coast.
241,"my friend went there and he loved it , so that enticed me to go"
242,"As much as I love a pizza, I made a veggie one this time to be on the more healthier side."
242,oh so you like veggie pizza? i really like it too
242,I try and spend a lot of time working out but sometimes the pizza gets the best of me.
242,"Yea,i try to find healthy alternatives that i like"
242,I used to have many health problems so I started eating more healthy and being more active. I started playing soccer and it has made an impact in my life.
242,That's great. I like to ride my bike when i am not mushroom hunting 
242," just received a scholarship for soccer. To help being fit, I do enjoy riding my bike to campus."
243,What is your favorite fruit?
243,I would say a banana. It has appeal.
243,haha see what you did there. I like green apples
243,"Green apples are a bit tart for me, but they taste great in pie. Yummy! Do you like apple pie?"
243,I love apple pie. I like pies in general 
243,"Yes, me too. I haven't met a pie that I didn't like. "
243,"Anything that includes fruit I like, In my mind its healthy even if its pie "
243,So true! I have that same mindset. Do you bake your pies?
243,sometimes but there is a tiny cafe near me that bakes amazing ones
243,I understand. We have a farmer's market that makes the best pies. She puts my pies to shame. 
243,where is it? I would love to go there and buy some
243,Mina's market. It's local. Her pies are to die for. The line is always long. 
244,I really enjoy eating junk food while playing games
244,i likr to travel with my cat
244,"I like traveling in games, heard there's a new game about cats."
244,ok good. cats can see in near darkness. I scared about dark so my pet is useful for me
244,I sometimes get scared in games where it's really dark and mysterious
244,the new one that just came out . lets play tomorrow ?
244,Sure! I'd love to try out the new game where the player is a cat
244,good

245,Both are great :) Do you play any instruments?
245,"I have always wanted to play the drums, but no. Do you play any?"
245,You should try learn. I can play violin. Do you like music?
245,Music is my everything. I fantasize about having a soundtrack playing to my life. How long have you played violin?
245,"I have only began learning, so I'm still picking it up. I love music too!"
245,My siblings played instruments.They both went to college for free because of their band accomplishments. I prefer to sing. :)
245,What kind of songs do you like to sing?
245,I like to sing gospel music or a little country. If I am in a certain mood then rock. What is your favorite music?
245,"I love classical music. After that, country music and jazz. Who is your favoruite artist?"
245,"A very sophisticated taste. Currently, I love Taylor Swift. (Don't Laugh!) "
246,Two. Do you study?
246,I study law since my father went to prison. I want to help him. What are you studying?
246,I'm studying law too! Though my reason was fuelled by my love of mystery novels. What you're doing is great.
246,I love mystery novels. Thank You. What do you do to relax when not studying?
246,"I'll normally read, hang out with friends, or go for a jog. What do you do?"
246,"When not studying, I train for marathons. Running really clears my head. What branch of law do you want to work in?"
246,Criminal law. What about you?
246,Criminal Law also. I believe there are too many people incarcerated unjustly due to our societal injustices. Will you defend or prosecute? 
246,"I agree with you. I would like to go into defence, do you have a preference?"
246,I guess I could go either way and support my cause but most likely I will be a defense attorney. I don't have any political goals. You?
246,"I don't, but I follow politics very closely. I find having an understanding of the political climate helps with my studies. Would you agree?"
246,Absolutely. Politics and law go hand in hand. I love a good debate. Do you have lawyers in your family?
247,"I prefer walking too, it's easier to take in and appreciate your surroundings that way. I love walking my dog!"
247,"Me too, I love taking my nephews for a walk and watching them explore the outside world."
248,I might have to try next I go for a run with my wife!
248,"You definitely should, you can make a game out of it with your wife."
248,Have I told you about my wife before? She was my best friend in highschool!
248,That's awesome that you've been together that long. Does she like to cook?
248,"She isn't a good cook. Last week, because of her food, I had a headache and had to call 911"
248,ha oh no! I love cooking. Did you get food poising? 
248,"What's your favourite dish? But yeah, I think it was a really bad case of food poisoning, but I'm okay now!"
249,It's a cat! I named him pickles because once he ate a whole jar of pickles when I was away! Haha
249,What!! The cat ate the entire jar of pickles! I can't even get my cat to eat notmal cat food
249,"Haha, Mr.Pickles is not a typical cat, I was given him by a gypsy fortune teller! It's a crazy story"
249,How old is he? It sounds like he's possessed.  Do you have a car? maybe take him for a drive.
249,I think he might be the oldest cat in the UK! He's already 35... he's older than my brother! 
249,Wait? Your cat is 35...how is that possible?
249,"I think you might be right, the Mr.Pickles might truly be a possessed demon cat haha"
249,Do you have any other animals?
249,"I used to have a parrot, but it flew away one time when I was having starbucks in a park. Do you have any?"
249,"I do, I have two dogs...but they are only 3 and 4 years old and would DEFINITELY not eat pickles."
249,Two dogs? And what are their names? But how do you know they wouldn't eat pickles? Have you tried? Haha
249,"Beaux and Gumbo, I live in south louisiana. I've tried to give them some pickles that have fallen on the ground, they licked them and ran away."
250,"No clue, I'm still not sure If I'm going to cash it or not. What do you think?"
250,I would get in touch with your bank and let them know about it! You don't want to get in any trouble by spending it.
250,"True, I really need the money though. Do you think I can get in legal trouble?"
250,"Yeah you probably would do, and that would make your situation worse. I don't think it's worth the risk! Are you working currently?"
250,"Yeah, I think so....one of my sisters ( I have 4) told me to take the risk, Do you have any debt?"
250,"I do yeah, I just got a new job though at an elementary school so I'm moving back to my hometown, so that will help ease the burden."
250,"Oh wow, What grade are you going to be teaching? I teach too."
250,5th grade! Yeah I'm excited. Just moved into an apartment really close to work. What grade do you teach?
250,"I teach 1st and 2nd PE... its insane all day, but I love it!"
250,I bet! What's your favorite sport to teach?
250,Right now I'm doing soccer but I REALLY like the tossing and catching unit. Its amazing how many kids don't know how to throw correctly.
250,Do you find it easy to teach them the correct technique? I'm a big soccer fan!
250,"Oh yeah, I was a javelin thrower in college."
251,I had it for 4 years. I was given it by my older sister for my birthday. It's a sad day... Do you have any pets?
251,Yeah I have one dog called cody.
251,"Aw, that's cute name for a dog. And how long have you had him?"
251,for three years this winter. We got him for the kids but it turns out I needed him more than them when they left for university haha.
251,"Kids move on very quickly when they go to university, but it's great that Cody can keep you company! After 3 years, he must be like family now"
251,"He definitly is! He's my baby now, along with the children I teach at school :) What od"
251,You're a teacher? And what do you teach? :) I don't know if I would be able to become a teacher haha
251,"I teach year two students, so it's not that difficult because they're just learning to count haha. You could! It's not difficult, you just need patience :)"
251,"Ahh, year two students definitely don't sound as bad as year 9 haha! But that's the thing, patience is necessary, and it's exhausting!"
251,It is exhausting! But at least I get a lot of holiday time to recover haha! Do you have a job?
251,"And are summer and winter holidays paid at all? Cause that's how long all together 4-5months?  But no, I'm currently at university :)"
251,"Ohhh that's interesting, what do you study? I loved university so much. Yes there's good holiday pay thankfully :)"
251,"I study politics and international relations, definitely an exciting degree in today's world haha :) "
251,Wow for sure! I'm in England so Brexit has been all over the news every day haha. Anyway I wish you luck with it!! :)
251,"I got fed up with talking about about Brexit, it's just a never-ending story! It's been going on for too long now haha! But thank you!"
252,"Sometimes the best part of Halloween is staying in and watching some horror flicks, that's what I like to do!"
252,"Horror flicks? Don't you ever get too scared? Haha! I'm not a fan of horrors, much prefer old British comedy tv shows"
252,"I do, but that's the fun of it! Have you ever seen Only Fools and Horses?"
252,"But when the movies finish, are you not scared that some of the horror things may happen to you?? Haha! But yes, I love only fools and horses!"
252,"Nope, I've made it so far in one piece! Who is your favorite character?"
252,"I watched a bit of paranormal activity and I just got too scared, it was too real haha! Rodney was my favourite. Who's your favourite?"
252,"Del Boy! Such a good show, I love the theme music. Do you like music?"
252,"Yes, I love music! I used to play guitar and piano when I was younger (used to be pretty good haha). Do you like music?"
252,"Yeah, I play guitar mainly. I want to be a music teacher! What's your favorite piece to play?"
252,"Why a music teacher and not a performer? But my favourite piece, hm, I played flamenco guitar - so 'asturias', such a good piece"
252,"I do perform, mostly on weekends, but I really enjoy working with new people who are keen to learn! Figured I could make a more reliable career out of it."
252,"It must take a lot of patience to be able to teach new people to play! I tried to teach my grandson, but he just didn't want to listen haha"
253,Mice aren't as bad as everyone thinks they are.
253,"I've got a fear of rodents, I don't like them in general. But why do you think that mice aren't as bad?"
253,They help keep other pests like insects away
253,"Okay, I agree here. To keep the biodiversity, mice are necessary. But keeping them as pets isn't the necessary"
253,"That's true its not, mine are kids to me. We watch Dr.Who together."
253,"You watch Dr.Who with mice? Haha, interesting. And have you read Dr.Who books?"
253,"I can't have books, the mice eat the pages."
253,"That's a shame. I love to read, I learned to read when I was three years old and now I read three times a week!"
253,"Reading is a fun way to take an adventure, before I got my mice I would read. What are your favorite types of books?"
253,"I love reading academic books and books about history! Books about Chinese, Russian and French history are fascinating!"
253,Do you know how to speak those languages?
253,"Sadly, I can only read about Chinese history in English, but I can speak the other languages. They are so fun1"
254,"That's nice, how long have they been married?"
254,"Ten years, my parents will celebrate their fifty anniversary next month. The younger generation could learn from them"
254,"Wow, I hope one day I can be with someone that long. Yes they can to many young marriages end in divorce."
254,"I have several children and I will have to teach them life, so that their marriages can last a long time"
254,That is a very good idea. I've yet to be married but hope to teach my children the same thing.
254,"If you're not married yet, don't rush into marriage. It's an important life event!"
254,I won't my boyfriend and I want to be in a more stable enviroment and financially be able to do so before we go there.
254,"That is the best approach to take, slow and steady! Especially today, financial stability is key"
254,Yes it is always better to be financially stable before than to just jump in without swimmies on so to speak.
254,I haven't heard this saying before! Is that an American or Australian saying?
254,American
254,Hello from across the pond then! I'm in the UK 
255,"Wow, I didn't know that. I think Bacon should be it's own food group."
255,"Bacon should be, and if you think about it, it's meat candy. It's so versatile as well. "
255,"I've never thought of it like that but it is. My favorite is using bacon with veggies, makes them taste better."
255,"Agreed, bacon with green beans is a great side dish."
255,I like to wrap it around asparagus topped with cheese.
255,Now that sounds really good! I may have to try that some time. Have you ever used bacon mixed with ground beef for a burger?
255,Yes I have I add peppers into the mix as well to give it a kick.
255,"Good trick, what type of bacon do you normally use? I prefer peppered bacon or thick cut."
255,I like applewood smoked.
255,"That's a good type too, perfect on a BLT"
255,"Yes it is, or I crumbled it and make bacon cheeseburger eggrolls. Which is so delicious."
255,"that sounds pretty good, I'll have to try that later!"
256,my sister also doing that
256,I sadly don't have an MBA like your sister. I'm a teacher. What's your job?
256,sales executive officer
256,That's a great job! How did you get that job?
256,from hiring
256,You send very long answers! Haha. Do you have a family? Any children?
256,i am a single
256,Are you happy in life?
256,yes. and you?
256,I am very happy because of my three children
256,how to manage your three children while studying
256,"I am not studying at university anymore, I am middle age already and have a full-time job"
257,"I like to read, and shop at sears."
257,Oh that's great. What type of books do you like to read?
257,Sci-Fi and Fantasy mostly. How about you?
258,"I am currently trying to grow some red and white roses, they are beautiful. Do you like gardening?"
258,Unfourtnally I can't grow anything.
258,That is unfortunate! I also have to be careful because my cat pickles likes to eat my plants
258,"That is such a cute name for a cat. I wish my landlord allowed pets, I would love to have a cat."
258,"He once ate a whole jar of pickles, hence why 'pickles'! You are not allowed to have any pets?"
258,No the landlord doesn't allow for any pets so that they don't destroy the floors.
258,"But if you could buy your own carpet and put on the floor, the floor would be protected!"
258,"I never thought of that, I need to bring that idea to them and maybe they will go for it."
258,"Yes, do so! Using good argument and offering to pay for the stuff on your own always works with landlords haha"
258,"I hope it works, I haven't had a pet since I was a really young child and would love to have one again."
258,"If you haven't had one, even more of a reason to try! Cats can be so lovely and so low-maintenance, they're great"
258,"I had one when I was little, his name was snowstorm since that's what he reminded me of but my uncle let him run away"
259,august 15
259,"Not sure, it achieved independence from the UK in 1962 I beleive"
259,ok. thanks .  i get new general knowledge from you
259,"take it with a grain of salt, those facts are off top of my head and I'm not 100% sure.  Maw believed in lots education"
259,anyway i consult with my friends
259,that's a good idea or talk to a friend that you really trust
259,are you feeling worst today
259,Not really.  Healthy as a horse I suppose
259,why?
259,just a feeling i get its wierd
259,ok God bless you to relief from worst moment 
259,i appreciate that
260,It felt good when Lebron left the Cavs for the Lakers
260,I always cheer for them when they play against the Lakers.
260,yeah I will play against the lakers
260,You are a player for the NBA?
260,No i'm not a player for the NBA You are a Player?
260,No. I just wondered what you meant by saying you would play against the Lakers. I am not athletic at all.
260,"Hm, Okay Then"
260,I do like to travel.
260,I do like to long drive with bike
260,"Fun! That takes a lot of energy. I prefer to drive in a car, but that sounds like a great workout!"
260,But I like that drive bike because fully watched nature better than car 
260,I agree. You are definitely more out in the elements on a bike.
261,im not very good at it though.
261,it is actually very simple once you learn a couple basic stitches .
261,Well i am still learning 
261,"Everyone is always learning, even ""experts"" learn new stuff to add to it."
261,"That's right, Im always looking for new ways to fill time and learn."
261,"I am to this is just one of my hobbies, my next goal is to learn to draw."
261,"Oh how nice, drawing is very relaxing. "
261,I feel that painting is but I've never been good at drawing itself so I'm trying to learn.
261,"Drawing is less messy, easier to clean up than paints "
261,"True, with painting I just like how the colors come together which relaxes me. But it is a very messy thing."
261,"My kids love to draw, Just have to make sure they don't eat the crayons. "
261,My kids use the crayons on the walls. My boyfriend says its okay cause we can always paint them but they're only little once.
262,"Hey, you can't win if you don't play. "
262,yea well i guess i need to buy a ticket if i ever plan to win
262,Never know one day I might hit millions and those tickets will all be paid for.
262,"Best of luck on that one, I always say if it wasn't for bad luck I'd have no luck at all, which is why I don't normally play"
262,I hear that! But I enjoy the dream and dreams can come true.
262,"That hope and optimism will take you far in life, its a good quality to have. "
262,Thanks! If I ever hit it big I would retire and travel the world! What would you do?
262,Go back to collage and get a degree in interior design or structual engineering 
262,You don't have to hit the lotto to do that. I got my degree online while raising two kids and working
262,I wouldn't be able to afford it without winning big like that.
262,Lots of government grants and pay as you earn plans make it almost bearable. There are also tons of scholarships out there for adult learners
262,"That's true, I'll have to look into that. Hopefully I can do that and then I'll feel like I've made myself proud of myself."
262,That's the spirit! Have a good day
262,"thank you , i will , you have a wonderful day too !"
263,"Oh nice, i always wanted to learn how to cook"
263,"Hopefully with some training you can. With the way trade has been and agriculture, different regions are now able to cook with vast ingredients."
263,"That's true, its remarkable what we even find at out local supermarket."
263,"That's so true, but I prefer to go to the farmers markets."
263,"Yes, and you can normally find some nice local produce at them.  "
263,"Right, I'm always amazed when a local grower has something new that they have worked to grow."
263,"indeed, the most i can grow is some tomatoes.  "
263,Maybe with some learning you can start to grow more things.
263,I do enjoy learning.  
263,"I do too, you can never know to many things."
263,I like to collect scotch. always on the lookout for that rare single malt. 
263,I like to collect empty liquer bottles
264,Ready to take on this test and the world! Lol
264,Nice! Is the beach involved in any of your plans? Because I love the beach!
264,I love it too and actually live close enough to take day trips throughout the year
264,Lucky! I do not live so close to the beach. I have to drive for about 30 minutes.
264,30 minutes is way shorter then my drive! I have almost 2 hours
264,Oh my! And I thought I had it bad! hahaha. I guess 30 minutes its too much for me. I need to live at the beach
264,lol I know that feeling. I love the wind in my hair and sand between my toes
264,"haha don't forget the light blue sky and the water! Plus, blue is my favorite color!"
264,I like purple like the sunset over the marshes around here
264,That is also a nice view! You mentioned a test earlier? What kind of test?
264,A test at work 
264,Oh! Ok! At what time do you have to take it? early morning?
264,"They haven't said yet, but morning is what I hope so I can stop worrying over it."
265,"Right, i always talk about this show with my friends when we're out drinking."
265,"Its a great topic because its such an awesome show, especially when drinking. "
265,im going to get a big tattoo of randy on my arm
265,That's cool. Do you have more tattoos or will it be your first?
265,"i have a whole arm full, a sleeve,  but nothing on the other arm, until Randy"
265,Awesome. I want to get a full sleeve done but haven't even started. I just have 3 little animals for my kids right now on my shoulder. 
265,How sweet.  i don't think ill be having kids any time soon .
265,"I didn't plan on them but wouldn't trade them, however no more for me. "
265,Not many people do plan on them.   i just like to drink and go out with my friends.
265,Having them took away most of my friends since I couldn't go out anymore.
265,"i understand that, but most friends are just temporary. "
265,"True, it definitly showed me who would be around when I needed support. "
265,take care.
265,You too! Thanks!
266,"I heard of Led Zeppelin before, and didn't someone in Black Sabbath start another band?"
266,"Yeah, I think so. The members of the band changed throughout the years."
266,That seems like the way things work. Always with the artistic differences
266,"Yeah! Also, I think that gives music a chance to evolve. Where are you from?"
266,Well that is a good point though I love pretty much all music but country
266,Nice! I also love all kinds of music. I especially like to wear cardigans to show how cultured I am in general
266,I personally just hang with friends and family and if we do something cultural so be it.
266,"Nice! Just go with the flow! I like telling people that my last name is Italian, but it is Spanish really."
266,"Okay, mine is definitely German so no getting out of that."
266,"That is pretty cool! I was in Europe not too long ago, but did not make it to Germany"
266,Never been outside the US have kids and student loans so don't see that changing in the next 20 years lol
266,"Well, things change! Hopefully, you will pay off all those loans soon!"
266,I doubt that but thanks!
267,"its not normally something i would do,"
267,I don't think I could even sign up for it I'm so afraid of heights 
267,"i thought i need some excitement, and maybe it will open the door for more opportunities."
267,I would love the adrenaline rush but need something that keeps me on the ground.
267,i have my dog for that. 
267,What type of dog do you have?
267,"Hes a border collie, getting old now though, hes 11! "
267,Those are such good breeds. I want to get a English Bulldog
267,They snore loudly. 
267,"Then it would fit in my household. All my kids, step kids and boyfriend snore so loudly."
267,"Oh gosh, im such a quiet person i would go insane"
267,I'm so used to it that if I didn't hear it I probably would go insane. 
268,I am not sure that I know who she is
268,She does celebrities make up and signs with an acoustic guitartis on Youtube
268,Oh she probaly does a good job then.  I am more into an artistic point of view. I like to paint
268,She does. What do you like to paint?
268,I like to paint pictures and look for inspiration 
268,"where do you take inspiration from? Landscape, people, animals, abstracts?"
268,I like to look at animals and people. Do you like to drink coffee? I am a coffee drinker especially with a lot of cream
268,"I am not a big coffee drinker. I like chai lattes but most of my caffine comes from soda, cola or pop depending on where you live lol."
268,lol. I have to drink coffee but I am now drinking decaf so it's not as bad.
268,You really do love coffee if you drink it for reasons beyond caffeine lol
268,I have two kids that keep me busy so its a requirement
268,I hear that. I have two of my own and caffine is definatly a requirement
269,i'm form downtown under and im friendly
269,Nice! Do you have any pets?
269,i have a pet hamaster
269,Cool! I have a doggie. Her name is Laila. I take her to the park all the time.
269,wow that's cool and is laila your only pet
269,"Yeah! Well, my boyfriend is currently unemployed. I wouldn't call him a pet though haha"
269,that cool do you have any friends
269,haha no! that is not cool! he needs a job asap. And yes! of course. You?
270,That sounds like it would be really pretty to visit.
270,"Indeed it is, there are lots of pretty places here.  Looks great from high up, the nicest place to fly over!"
270,"I've heard that Reno is really nice this time of year, with lots of snow."
270,Oh now that's a place i've never been to. i would like to know more.
270,Las Vegas seems like it would be a fun place to visit with my friends.
270,I bet it would be so fun!   Its a rather expensive place though?
270,"There are probably inexpensive ways to travel there, I'd imagine, and if you have enough people to split costs"
270,"Yes the travel is only part of it though,  i used to live in Nevada, "
270,What part of Nevada?
270,In the vally
270,oh ok.  Is Reno less expensive than Las Vegas?
270,"It might be, i'm not sure to be honest. "
271,That is true! Do you like watching Game of Thrones?
271,I have only seen the first 5 minutes of the the first show. Do you like game of thrones?
271,Not really haha. Is there any show or series that you enjoy watching?
271,I dont watch a lot of T.V. like to spend my extra time pickling eggs
271,"Interesting. My friends like watching Game of Thrones, but I do not."
271,have you ever eaten pickled eggs?
271,No not really? I'd be up to try them though!
271,Next time you have them try them cooked in goose liver fat and scotch. AMAZING!
271,"What? That sounds very interesting. Usually, my friends and I eat and drink beer. Maybe, I can get them to try them with me next time."
271,I think it would go great with beer and some salted crackers.
271,"Ok, so next time I will propose that! Maybe as we watch football or something. How easy is it to make them?"
271,not long if you buy eggs already pickled. maybe 20 minutes. if you pickle them your self you will need to plan way ahead of time like a week
272,Do you have any siblings?
272,"yes , I have two younger sisters"
272,"that's cool, i just have one twin brother. are your younger sisters close to you in age?"
272,Oh! that's pretty cool to have an twin brother .Isn't it
272,Yea it's cool most of the time but it can be annoying. We look alike so it gets aggravating having people confuse us all the time.
272,"oh , that's ok . i'm really short , so people can make fun of me about that"
272,"Yeah I'm a real short person too so I get that all the time. Plus, as a male, people think its weird that my favorite hobby is baking cakes."
272,Do you have a lot of experience baking cakes?
272,"I've been baking cakes for about 20 years, since I was seven. I really got into the decoration process when I was 14."
272,That's interesting. You must be very talented
272,Talent is part of it but I've studied often to gain as much knowledge and technique as I can. I look for new info continuously.
272,"Good, remember to practice it all stages of life"
273,cool
273,Have you seen Shawshank Redemption ?
273,yes its good
273,Yes it is. have you seen the new one ?
273,im looking forward seeing the new one
273,"You definitely should, Clint Eastwood is the main character "
273,i love that guy
273,Do you feel lucky.
273,yes
273,that was his quote. do you know what film ?
273,tommorow is promise no one
273,Whats that movie about ?
274,I'm not sure about that.
274,I am darn sure about one thing though. Pancakes for breakfast are my favorite
274,"Agreed.  Pancakes are pretty good, but waffles though"
274,hahaha waffles with maple syrup though!!! haha My girlfriend loves them as well!
274,Where do you get the best pancakes?
274,"I have tried them everywhere, and I think Denny's or Ihop do a good job."
274,"it is my opinion, that breakfast food should be any meal, not just the morning."
274,Yes! Me and my girlfriend have breakfast for lunch ahah. We have been going out for a month now and we have done that every week since haha
274,That sounds like a great tradition!
274,"Yes!!! There is something about coffee, pancakes and waffles!!!"
274,agreed!
274,Do you have breakfast for lunch or even dinner often?
274,"We do ""breakfast for dinner"" sometimes"
275,"I love running at night, so I went and almost forgot about my anniversary being the next day."
275,"Sometimes, we forget stuff. It happens. How did the anniversary go?"
275,"It went great! Although, I love spicy food. I ate too much of it and it upset my stomach ahah"
275,I love spicy food too! What type of food do you like the most?
275,"Really? That is awesome! Well, love Peruvian food the most. But there is Thai as well!"
275,So what other types of food do you like?
275,"I really like Brazilian, Puerto Rican, Argentinean, Chinese and Japanese. What about you?"
275,"I love Chinese food, Its delicious! I also like sweets from Japan. They're both really good!"
275,Yes! Mochi ice cream is great! Fried rice though!!!
275,There was a restaurant in Florida that I went to during my vacation. They had the BEST chinese food! Too bad they closed.
275,Oh! that is too bad! Do you remember the name of the restaurant?
275,"It was called ""Li's Magic Noodle House"" or something. "
276,i love my friends alot and i don't want any trouble
276,I respect that but being honest and just telling her how you feel is best in the long run.
276,its nice overall
276,"Where were you planning to vacation, just out of curiosity?"
276,i like going to combindia cause its fun
276,i normally take my weeks vaca right about now to florida . glad i didn't .
276,florida its known for it's crazy weather
276,"Yea, I love hockey and the Florida Panthers are my favorite team. Usually I go there this time of year to attend a game and hit the beach."
276,its cool i like to go to florida sometime to escape stress in my life and relax
276,Same here. My mother usually looks after my grandmother but she had to go out of town this week so I had to cancel. 
276,yes i can relate. i wish my parents can get along
276,"I'm sorry to hear about that. I lost my father sixteen years ago but my mother, grandmother, and I are very close."
277,"Oh, very interesting. "
277,Yes! I am vegan but not because of that. It is more because of my health!
277,I'm vegan as well!
277,Oh nice!!!! I feel like a lot more vegan restaurants have opened recently. Or at least more restaurant adding vegan choices.
277,"I agree! It's much more widespread than it was in the past, for sure."
277,That is a good thing! Do you happen to play any instruments?
277,I learned piano as a child.
277,No way!!! I learned piano at age 6!
277,How long did you take lessons?
277,I kept doing it until age 16. What about you?
277,I stopped at 12. I really wasn't very good. haha
277,It does not matter. There is something magical and relaxing about the piano.
278,Oh she couldn't get something she wanted you know how it is.
278,Does she do that a lot?
278,"Well shes a teenage girl, very emotional at times. "
278,Oh I understand. My little sister used to be the same way. Luckily it's just a phase.
278,Hope she will grow out of it
278,Maybe find something to do with her to cheer her up. Have you gone clubbing before?
278,"I don't drink, i have to stay fit for playing the the league."
278,"I don't drink either, i jsut like going out and dancing."
278,Its good for fitness i guess. 
278,Good for blowing off some steam. It's gotta be pretty stressful playing in the league.
278,yea it is. but the eagles are a good bunch.
278,Still can't believe you went to Philly. You got your dream team.
279,It's so hot there! I don't know how anyone could live there in the summer.
279,"Agreed! Hot and humid... and rainy! I like to see the seasons, especially winter! My favorite!"
279,I wen't to Disney World with my kids during vacation once. It rained for almost 5 days!
279,Oh no!! That is bad! I hope that did not ruin your vacation.
279,I had to wait in line for hours in the rain. It has horrible.
279,I hope the kids did not get a cold!
279,"They didn't, thank god. Could have been way worse I guess."
279,Yeah! I usually take vitamin c all the time just to prevent colds. You should do the same with the kids! Thank god no cold after all that rain.
279,Thanks for the tip! Does vitamin C really prevent colds?
279,Yeah! and Zinc! It helps prevent them but it does not make much of a difference once you have it.
279,Do you think they will ever find a cure for the cold? It's so annoying.
279,It mutates a lot! I hope that they will at some point. We have to be careful with all these mutations though.
280,how was your day
280,My day was amazing! I got to hang out at the beach all day!
280,thats cool
280,Yeah! I just moved to Florida and I am so excited to be able to go to the beach. I never really got to before.
280,the best part of it is going to universal studios to have a blast
280,I can't wait to go to Harry Potter World!!!!
280,i love that its the best part to the trip
280,I can't wait to try Butter Beer and go to Daigon Alley!
280,i go there next time i go
280,Another thing that I love about living here is how many concerts they have. You know bigger cities and all.
280,i love taking pictures everytime i vist i usually paint the pictures captured
280,That's a great talent! I wish that I could paint!
281,That's interesting and could be helpful. 
281,I got the loan on my tractor modified after the farm was foreclosed. It helped a lot.
281,"That sounds good, maybe ill let my husband know about it as im busy at work a lot."
281,Definitely worth looking into. I think most companies can provide a quote online. 
281,"Great!  i like doing things online, its so easy."
281,I try to do everything online. Too cold most of the time to go outside. need to move somewhere warmer. 
281,oh tell me about it. its very cold where i am from. 
281,This time of year the temp just drops. My fault for living right on the Ohio River. 
281,Still that's a wonderful place to live. !
281,"Oh yeah, some of the best food I've ever had. Still thinking about moving somewhere warmer."
281,i would like to move but i have to many responsibilities here with my job as a nurse
281,I can't imagine how stressful that must be. It must be very rewarding. 
282,yes for fun
282,"I played in college, not just for fun. Trying to get a little league started at the rec center."
282,its tuff i wish you luck.  
282,Thanks. What else do you like to do?
282,"i love eating anything italian , watching forensic files and jeopardy "
282,Great shows! Have you ever been it italy?
282,i have been there a couple of times
282,How is it? I've always wanted to go?
282,its beautiful and its nice to use overall
282,What do you mean nice to use?
282,i mean its so beautiful and i want to be part of the culture
282,Oh I understand. I just can't even imagine how great the good there must be!
283,I'm going to have to do better at remembering to flush next time!
283,oh ok will try good best
283,Have you ever forgotten to flush?
283,just once luckily it was not during a live performance . would have been embarrassed .
283,Thank goodness it was not during a performance! I would have been embarrased too!
283,yeah . . my coworker is an idiot
283,"Oh my, I'm sorry to hear that. I imagine that he/she has some good qualities too though?"
283,i suppose . i am mad at my coworker too
283,What happened to make you mad?
283,Fired someone with out telling my boss. Two coworkers got in a a fight I perceived opportunity the be the best time to get rid of one.
283,Oh my; well hopefully the workplace will be less caustic without the fighting now!
283,i felt angry about it . but that was then and this is now .
284,I have two children
284,"oh wow! Do you want anymore, my mom wanted a ton but she's also an osteopath"
284,"I'm not sure, with childcare expenses these days it unfortunately becomes a business decision as well"
284,"I completely agree, thats why I've watied so long. They said that a cost of one kid NOT including college is close to 200,000"
284,"It is expensive for sure, but the quality of life you obtain through seeing the world through the eyes of children again is priceless.  It keeps you young!"
284,But its the unconditional love. Kids love you no matter what
284,"This is true - it's much like pets as well.  And, the ability to shape their minds and lives is a huge responsibility."
284,Do you have any pets? I have two dogs.
284,"I have a dog and a cat - my kids like playing with them as well, and while they do it gives me a chance to relax and read"
284,"Oh wow, and they get along good? I have always wanted a cat but scared about already having dogs."
284,They do.  My cat acts like a dog.  And my kids chase them around the yard to burn out energy.
284,Do they all sleep together?
284,"Sometimes, the cat stays outside quite a bit as well."
285,"That is very interesting, do you enjoy it?"
285,i hate it ! i do enjoy grilling though
285,"I wish I had the talent, I am a terrible cook!"
285,"If you keep working at it, I'm sure you'd be a great cook! "
285,"I do enjoy playing the piano though, my ten year old son is coming along to it as well."
285,Wow! Maybe I should start taking some piano lessons and go to a recital of my own.
285,You absolutely should! It is a wonderful experience. I enjoy it very much.
285,"I agree I should,It would be a fun experience! "
285,Youtube is very helpful for picking  up some free tips if you do not wish to commit to lessons right away!
285,I like using You Tube to get instructions when I am not sure what i am supposed to do in a  situation
285,I feel the same way. I use it much more than I realize I do. Mostly cooking tips for me!
285,that sounds very helpful ! are you planning to be a chef ?
286,"I do too, they're able to sense emotion so well!"
286,indeed. especially dogs. it feels like that they read my mind even when I dont speak
286,Do you have any pets?
286,"No, but I must get one to get me out walking. and you? "
286,No I don't have any pets either. If I did have one I would get a dog though
286,"me too, so, I would have to walk it every day. "
286,You could definitely get some more exercise that way; I need to exercise more often
286,I would hope if you had a dog you would take them for walks. You have space for one? 
286,Not really; maybe I should get a fish instead?
286,What about the excercise? :)
286,Maybe I could put them a travel aquarium and go for walks!
286,yes that sounds like a great idea ! you are very creative. 
287,"Yeah, I haven't lost a parent yet, so I don't know what to do or say to her."
287,"Well, I have lost a grandparent as well, and most of the time you don't need to say anything - just be there."
287,"That's what I've been doing, her family is all coming in, so I've been cleaning and getting food and stuff in"
287,That's a good way to be supportive - anything to help her - especially to allow her more time with her family.  Does she like to draw?
287,"Yeah, she does. But I'm a truck driver so I have to leave for a few days too. So hopefully her family will be here to help."
287,I would make sure that she has family for support and isn't alone.  Drawing is a good coping outlet for me - I draw my feelings and it helps
287,Do you suggest I get her a journal and pencils?
287,A drawing journal would be good so she could draw and write out her feelings.  Gives her a healthy way to release them
287,Yeah! I think thats great! Even one of those that have prompts for her to write or draw.
287,"Yeah that's true, what does she usually like to draw?  You might encourage her to draw something she likes also to make her happy."
287,She likes to draw animals.
287,I always liked drawing animals too - I used to go to the zoo and sit and draw the animals.
288,That sounds like a ton of fun to have with friends!
288,its extremely fun!
288,What kind of events do you typically have tailgate parties?
288,College Football games and Basketball Games are the best events! 
288,Sounds like a great time.
288,It is if you enjoy being out socially! 
288,"I do, I missed a lot growing up in foster care system, but I went to community college which I was able to socialize."
288,"I'm glad you were able to experience socialization, and i'm sorry about your coming up in foster care. I know that can be hard."
288,It wasn't easy but I had great supporters. 
288,That's great I'm happy you did. You know I've never been on an airplane. Just hit me when thinking about my past.
288,I can surely relate! Turbulence can be frightening!
288,oh yes i can imagine .
289,Maybe I could invite some of my classmates to play ultimate frisbee
289,That would be a lot of fun - sports are a great way to meet new friends.
289,Yeah they are; are you in school?
289,I'm actually in college - I play Ultimate Frisbee on an intramural team
289,"That's awesome! I'm studying law right, what are you studying?"
289,Crazy enough - I'm studying Pre-Law and Political Science (Dual Major).
289,"Oh wow, I bet that's tough. Is it a big workload?"
289,"Yeah it is, but I stay on top of my course work.  If I try to wait till the last minute it gets overwhelming"
289,I was always bad about procrastinating too
289,"Yeah, it was a terrible habit I had to break in high school.  I was lucky to always be one of the ""smart"" kids."
289,"Yeah, being ""smart"" is sometimes bad though since it's easy to make bad habits lol"
289,"Yeah, I was always able to get by with just watching/listening to the lectures.  Photographic memory."
290,But I didn't win it- - It was tickets to the backstreet boys
290,I seen the backstreet boys back in 93! Good times.
290,Have you! I'm so jealous....my 1990's VSCO girl was screaming...I wanted it so bad. Have you ever won an award?
290,I have won an award for writing! Such a great feeling. what about you?
290,"Oh wow, for what?"
290,A best selling novel. 
290,Are you serious??? thats awesome
290,Yes! I am working on another at the moment. Have you won any awards?
290,I have .... I was a 2 x All- American in college as a javelin thrower.
290,Now that is true talent! 
290,Thanks- it was a blast! We actually won the team title in 2008
290,That's amazing! That requires so much athleticism. 
291,"It is, and working for peta makes life even more difficult "
291,"PETA?  Wow, I bet.  What do you do there?  Kids would be hard enough without work."
291,"I tend to the animals, being a vegetarian made me appreciate the animals more. "
291,I see.  Noble profession.  I was a vegan for several years.  I have reintroduced fish now.
291,"Fish used to be a favorite of mine, maybe someday I will taste the fine trout again ! "
291,"Yeah, I only eat fresh caught, non-farm raised.  The Real Deal.  Salmon is my preference."
291,"Ah, Salmon is delicious. Going vegetarian changed all that for me though, now it's plant based only. "
291,I get it.  I usually do fish tacos - one of my favorites.  It's also easy and quick to make at college.
291,Those are also quite tasty! I miss the days like that. 
291,"Yeah, you can still eat the guacamole though!  I'm studying to be a doctor.  So, I wanted to be healthy"
291,"That was a great career choice! And yes guacamole fits right into my vegetarianism. Working for peta makes less time for eating though,"
291,"Yeah, I'm sure.  But a working for a good cause is meaningful and rewarding - I couldn't imagine having a boring, meaningless job."
292,"I agree. I enjoy reading books, but I can't find a good blog for books."
292,I try not to rely on blogs for information.
292,Very true. But blogs can be a great place to voice opinions about things that you read.
292,Indeed.
292,Do you like to read? Fiction? Nonfiction?
292,"I love fantasy and sci-fi. My friends say my library is arranged well, but I still think it could use some improvement."
292,I like fantasy and sci-fi as well. I really enjoyed reading the Game of Thrones series. 
292,"I've never watched it, but I hear that Game of Thrones is a great show."
292,"It was a great show, wasn't too happy with the ending, so I'm holding out hope for the books. There are still 2 books that he hasn't released yet. "
292,"I did not know it was ending, sorry to hear that!"
292,It's OK. All good things must come to an end right? What about you? Favorite book or series? 
292,"Wheel of Time is the top one for me, But I also like most of the Brandon Sanderson Novels I've read too. Particularly the Cosmere stuff."
292,I'll have to check it out. It was fun talking. Have a great rest of the day
293,"Yes, I just wish I knew how to help. She is worried getting adults involved is going to make things harder for her."
293,"Well for sure, but it seems important that she learn the importance of getting adults or authority figures involved."
293,"Yes , summer vacation is so nice she is not as stressed. I enjoy summer very much."
293,Oh indeed!  Though summer also means less structure and possibly fewer support networks.  I'm glad that she she is less stressed.  Is she working a summer job?
293,"Yes she is working down at the local comic store, which is awesome our favorite hero is The Flash!"
293,"That's great.  Can't say that I know much about comic books, though some are very valuable.  Maybe I should buy some for an investment."
293,"Would be smart, especially if you know which comics are most rare. "
293,I absolutely wouldn't know which comics are rare.  Would your daughter be able to advise?
293,I am sure she can do some research and find out! I would guess Classic Joker comics would be a good start.
293,Perhaps we'll make a visit to her shop.  My wife likes helping young ladies and I like investing in atypical assets!
293,That would be perfect! I know she would be thrilled to have visitors! 
293,Absolutely.  We love helping build community.
294,"Not well, I'm a yoga instructor and tried showing him some techniques to help him relax through grieving. "
294,"Great idea, that is good for the body and mind.  Being there for him alone will help - shows you care."
294,You have to be there for your friends. Watch a good romantic comedy with them. Get a nice laugh going. 
294,"True enough.  ""Laughter is the best medicine.""  I usually watch movies alone though."
294,Not myself. The idea of a romantic comedy alone is boring to me. But being alone can be good for the soul. 
294,"Yeah, I work in a factory so I don't get a chance to talk to many people.  I like being alone."
294,Maybe you should take on Yoga. Great activity for when you're alone! 
294,I do like exercise - I've never tried Yoga.  Do you have any suggestions on where to start?
294,Purchase a book at any book shop. It will show you the basics. Then seek out a professional later for more advanced learning! 
294,Ok - thanks for the tip.  I'll definitely have to check that out.  I want to stay healthy.  I hope it helps out your friend
294,I do aswell.  Keep his minds off things. Then take him to see a wonderful romantic comedy! 
294,"Yeah, what's your favorite romantic comedy?  You seem to really enjoy them"
294,My favorite is Something's gotta give with Jack Nicholson. Woderful Film! 
294,I'll have to check it out - thanks!
295,What concert are you planned to attend?
295,"I love southern rock, though it's rare to get time away from my studies... who are you seeing on sunday?"
295,"I am planning to see Phil Collins in Las Vegas, NV."
296,Well that's too bad!  You missed out there - do you like any Heavy Metal Music though?
296,Yes! That is actually my favorite type of music.
296,Awesome.  Do you like going to see concerts live?  They can get pretty intense.
296,They can. I think its the best part though! You can really feel the music in your bones. 
296,"Yeah, agreed - I always feed off the energy from the crowd as well - it becomes a full body experience."
296,"Truly! I prefer a smaller venue setting as opposed to Music Festivals though, how about you?"
296,"Yeah, I like the acoustics in smaller venues.  Typically though I like unplugged or acoustic performances in smaller venues though."
297,"Yes, and by rooting yourself in the Bible, You can have a strong family bond! "
297,"Yeah, my mom created a strong foundation in the church for me.  We went to Sunday School and the weekly service."
297,"Being a married man, heaped in religion. The Bible is my favorite book. Which book in the bible is yours ? "
297,I'm not sure I understand your question - but my favorite book in the Bible is Psalms
297,Yes the Psalms are beautiful. Myself and my wife like reading Psalms before bed for peace of mind. 
297,I agree - they've always brought me comfort.  Reading in general before bed does for me.  I recently strayed away some though from the Lord
297,"We all stray, but by going back to the good book we can find ourselves again. "
297,"Yeah, that's my goal.  I recently had a mid life crisis and changed my hair blue - I'm thinking of returning to my natural roots."
297,My wife would destroy me if i colored my hair blue. But going back to our natural roots is always best. Biblical roots for a strong foundation. 
297,"Yeah, my family wasn't too happy with me - they thought I was depressed.  I also own blue shoes - thought I had the ""blues"""
297,"Even the blues can be healed through the words of Jesus Christ, have faith! "
297,"Yes, I've returned to the Church, and have been attending weekly Biblical Counseling sessions - they've helped."
298,"I have to travel all the way back to the embassy and apply for its replacement, but anyway, "
298,That sounds like a pain. What embassy? 
298,Its the British Embassy where I live. It has been a while we moved here and I rather like to enjoy time exploring. 
298,"Oh nice never been, maybe one day but for now I am enjoying my cabin and fishing on the lake. What was the document?\"
298,: my passport proof to use when travelling while the new one is on the way.. Do you go to seaside?
298,I do sometime plans in the work for the beach for Thanksgiving\
298,Can you imagine I never learned swimming! :(
298,"Swimming is really fun and besides it, it is very healthy as it involves all muscles of the body to be engaged in movement"
298,"Can't dispute. One must spend some time at beach to learn it, isnt it? "
298,You can learn to swim at any pool. There is a YMCA in town with a pool.
298,Far away from home :(
298,Internet can teach some basics even far from home.
299,I used to work food service
299,That's awesome! I would like to become a music teacher. Maybe after retirement.
299,That's cool. Having your own business sounds like a good start?
299,I agree! I graduated in 86... I may have to go retake some business courses to refamiliarize!
299,"Oh yeah, I used to work early until 5pm and go to school at night. You could certainly take a refresher!"
299,I sure hope I still have the brain for it. It's not as zippy as it used to be!
299,"I know what you mean! I learned business from my family's food business,but that felt like a long-time ago. "
299,"A lot has changed but good, honest service will always keep a business thriving."
299,"On another topic, Do you have plans for the holidays?"
299,"Not sure yet, May travel to see family. How about you?"
299,"I wanted to do something, but I'll mostly just take the time to relax and cook. "
299,Those plans sound lovely! 
300,"As someone who works in finance,  I can tell you we need those skilled employees! "
300,"Yeah, well, like they say - those who can't do - teach.  I wanted to work in Finance - I may try again."
300,"Working in Finance has it's benefits, I'm sure you'd be a great asset ! "
300,"Yeah, I appreciate it - I think I'll test the waters again - I'm feeling more confident."
300,"Do you own a car? I live walking distance from the firm and have chosen to sale mine, do you think it was a good idea? "
300,If you can walk - for sure - a huge expense that you don't need.  And you get exercise to boot!
300,Thanks! I thought I made the right decision. Walking does the body good! 
300,Yes it does.  I actually prefer to mountain bike though.  You could always do that as a form of transportation as well.  I would if I could!
300,I may try that! It would make the commute quicker even if I am close!
300,"Yeah - and, if you put a basket on it, you can go pick up some groceries as well."
300,"Working in finance the hours don't give me much free time, You're absolutly right thats a great idea! "
300,"Yeah - anytime I can be efficient, I am.  I have kids and there's a lot that I want to do before I die - like skydive."
301,"Yeah, I always liked the Coldplay song Yellow.  Wasn't a huge fan of the rest of their music though."
301,"thats fair i also like coldplay as well as Radiohead, good english bands. And Korea Bands."
301,I love Radiohead though - most of their non-radio songs.  Ok Computer was my favorite.  I used to relax and eat pizza while listening to them.
301,Yeah I had Electioneering in my head all day yesterday.
301,Great Song - Paranoid Android was my favorite.
301,"It's hard to believe the record came out almost 25 years ago. Even though I was in my 40s back then, I still loved new music."
301,"Yeah, a true fan can appreciate good music at all ages.  It's much like my steak preferences - I can always taste a perfectly cooked one."
301,"Yeah, my social security check doesn't leave much money for steak. May I come stand outisde your house and sniff the air next time you cook?"
301,For sure - smells are always free!
301,Do you put butter on it? I love butter because of the soft yellow shade.
301,"I do.  I could it with butter, and prefer mine medium to medium rare.  I actually like listening to music while I'm cooking."
301,"Yes, I find KPop goes well with warming up Vienna sausages"
301,I agree.  There's a different band for each taste.
302,"I would like to start going to the gym to help me lose some weight, but it's hard to get motivated? Any suggestions? "
302,Hi I'm Ray. I am a physical fitness enthusiast. I believe eating healthy and exercising is a important.
302,I think exorcise would really help me. What do you use to keep yourself motivated? 
302,"I am very conscious of my weight, so that is one motivator. Also, I feel mentally better when I exercise. That alone is motivation."
302,That's a good point. I need to get on some sort of diet plan as well. I try for a few days then I get frustrated and quit.
302,Setting a goal each day is helpful. Even a little exercise and at least one healthy meal each day helps alot; chicken and rice is my favorite.
302,I love that idea of setting smaller daily goals. And I love chicken and rice. 
302,"I started going to the gym once a week, working up to 4 times a week. I also write down everything I eat. It helps to visually see the progress."
302,Yeah I could see that. Kind of like banking. Keeping track of everything so I can hold myself accountable
302,Exactly! Keeping healthy food in the freezer is also good. I make my favorites (chicken and rice!) and freeze it for easy use.
302,Another awesome idea! Thanks! Do you have special containers or something to freeze it?
302,I also budget like you! I use freezer ziplock bags so its easy and doesn't take much space. I let them thaw while I'm at the gym or work.
303,"Yes, he did felt bad about failing the exam."
303,What class was it?  I just hope it wasn't important to his program of study...
303,"Yes, it was his final math exam."
303,Oh my.... I never liked math.... painting and math just don't mix!  What will he do to recover his grade?
303,I think he will get a second chance or make up.
303,I hope the teacher allows that.  My painting instructor is certainly easy like that.  Was the party at least fun?
303,How long were you painting?
303,Well it's part of my major and my favorite class.... so really I paint every semester!
303,I have attended a painting in my 7th grade class.
303,What did you paint back then?
303,We were painting still life pictures.
303,Still life is a fine start!  Maybe your partying math friend should consider painting.
304,"Yeah, my mother works as a nurse and she recently had a patient die on her - she is struggling."
304,My that's awful.  Tragic infact.  Does that happen regularly in her career?
304,"Yeah, she works at the intensive care unit - so unfortunately - she deals with it often, this one just hit home more "
304,I really can't imagine... does she do the early morning shift?
304,"3rd shift (nights) - sees all the bad victims - shootings, etc.  This one though she knew the person."
304,I can't imagine dealing with the death of someone you knew at those hours in those circumstances.
304,"Yeah, it was tough for her - and the bad thing is, he was revived twice, but couldn't pull through."
304,That's traumatic.  What sent him to the hospital?
304,Car Accident.  A drunk driver hit him head on.
304,oh my goodness.  that's a tragedy.
304,It was - why she's taking it so hard.  I try to play her some rolling stones though to soothe her.  It is our favorite band.
304,"i'm an opera fan myself, but music is therapeutic."
305,"Yes! Art is always a smart investment, especially since it brings so much joy! Like two for one!"
305,I went to New York recently to explore my interest in becoming a museum curator.
305,Interesting!! What did you explore while you were there?
305,"I visited a few museums, as well as explored the beautiful city. Do you like to travel?"
305,"Sounds lovely. i love to travel, but I prefer getting out of the city and into the forest. National parks are my favorite places to visit."
305,Nature is very peaceful! You can really find yourself on a visit to the national forests!
305,"Absolutely! As Maxime Lagacé once said, ""By discovering nature, you discover yourself""."
305,Indeed. Nature is very interesting and complex to interpret. Survival is the only mechanism that drive us to have certain physical features
305,That sounds like a great premise for an Art Exhibition!
305,I enjoy watching art. Maybe I'll hapen across some of it!
305,"Yes, me too. Being in nauture certainly inspires me to make art! I think thats why I go out to the woods so often. "
305,i started taking painting classes recently. Outdoor art would be a fun thing to try!
306,What movies do you watch on Netflix?
306,I like anything about dogs or islands. you?
306,I would like a Cockapoo
306,"I have a Weimeraner. I like cockapoos, but I need a bigger dog to help around my island."
306,What type of help do you need on the island?
306,Mostly I need one who can fetch beverages and lie on pool floats
306,Haha...that's a smart dog
306,Indeed. She also helps pick the movies I watch.
306,What are her favorite movies?
306,The Air Bud ones. She's really into films with other pups.
306,Haha...Marley & Me is a cute one
306,Oh she doesn't like it when the dog dies. Growls at the screen.
306,I don't blame her. I never watch that part
307,good old times :)
307,My good old times are the gym for an intense game of raquetball. I joined the team and play any chance I get.
307,Ever played it professionally? 
307,Not yet but all the time spent at the gym and I probably could.
307,Nowadays we see stars coming everywhere. I wish I met a good mechanic nowadays.
307,I got my love of the game from watching my dad play hand ball when I was young. Probably where my love of Middlesex came from too.
307,"If you fancy some antiquity, I could offer you my car :)"
307,Probably not old enough to be antique yet but my dream car would be a 85' Chevy Silverado
308,"I have a ton of friends, and growing up we used to play in the neighborhood when a dog chased me. "
308,Why was the dog chasing you?  
308,I don't know/ remember but the bus driver rescued me basically. Funny thing is my name is nick and i could hear the owner of the dog yelling nick.
308,That's funny!  Maybe your mom was calling you at the same time. ;) Next time you'll have to throw out a distraction or something
308,I know right! I'll just have to keep dog treats on  hand and make a run for it.
308,That and take up running!  I got pretty quick once I started running regularly myself
308,"Actually I do happen to love running, although I don't have the time for it as much. Do run competitions? "
308,"When I get a chance.  It's gun, but I'm more of a solitary person myself... just me, the road and my fishing pole. "
308,"Ah, Ok. Yeah nothing beats sitting on a dock or boat and chilling with the sun."
308,"exactly, a nice day of relaxing is just right. "
308,My friends and I used to go noodling - cat-fishing. It's too rough on the body.
308,I don't mess witht he cat fish myself.. those barbs can be brutal!  you're pretty brave to do that bare handed imho
309,"They are 14 and 12, I hate cleaning so this should make my life a little easier! "
309,"Oh, poor you! But once they become full adults things will be easier!"
309,True but i work a full time job in finance. So things are never that easy. 
309,"I,m working as a librarian full time.Also on Satuirdaymornings."
309,"That's a lot of hours. Saturdays used to be my cleaning days, I hated them. "
309,"Oh,I don't really mind working on Sat.morning. I love talking to people."
309,"Working in finance all my conversations are about money, So it can be a bit boring. "
309,Yes! I understand that! My conversations are not about books and writers alone. I know a lot of those people.
309,My conversations are always business related. In the finance world it's all about the Benjamin's 
309,You just reminded of my favorite song of Breaking Benjamin 
309,Breaking Benjamin is a great band! So Cold is a fantastic song! I can almost clean when I listen to it! 
309,That is one of the tunes that is on the gold record flying out of our solar system on the Voyager probe.
310,I'm getting into a lot of Swedish bands now that I live here.
310,"That's awesome, I'm more of a book guy. Music is my second love. Reading comes first. But I do love a good tune. "
310,Really? If you like nonfiction you should check out Melanie Dotcity
310,I will do that it sounds great! I love true stories! What color is your hair? Mines brown. Sorry it's been on my mind. 
310,Mine is also brown but it has reddish highlights when I'm out hiking on glaciers
310,That sounds beautiful! So you live in Sweden then ? 
310,"Yes, I moved here from Florida"
310,I currently live in Florida! What a coincedence! That must be a huge change! 
310,It is! Where in Florida?
310,"I'm from Sebastian Florida, Right underneath Cocoa beach ! What part are you from ? "
310,For real? I'm in Palm Bay
310,"Nice, I go to Palm Bay all the time to shop and hangout! "
311,She really is talented and I'm proud of her effort.
311,That is awesome! Such a great sport for young ladies!
311,I know... I only did beauty pagents and that was not worth the time
311,I feel you. That sport is very majestic and can be considered any art form
311,"True, though they need a mascot!"
311,"True, what types of foods you enjoy?"
311,anything but pork.... i have always wished to have pet pot-bellied pig! lol
311,"I agree, actually I only eat vegetarian foods!"
311,And vegetarian is good for both my figure and the earth!
311,Very true! Do you enjoy listening to music?
311,Music is always on around here!
311,I like listening to classic rock most of the time. It's my favorite era of music.
312,"Who or what is Aeri?  I love the American Eagle, though!"
312,Aeri was actualy a sub brand of American Eagle outfiters lingerie retailer .
312,"Maybe I should get some for my girlfriend's birthday, though that might be too forward"
312,"How long have you been dating? Back in the day, it would be offensive."
312,Nearly two years.... 
312,"Yes, that is probably not an offensive gift then"
312,I do love her and that store... maybe I'll take some money from my new-truck savings account...
312,What if she doesn't like it?
312,I'd best keep the receipt! 
312,Or play it off as a joke
312,At least she likes the chevy truck i want to buy
312,oh i drive an aston martin pickup truck
313,Hi! I am Mary. I have two children. My oldest son has autism. He is 7 years old and is the light of our life. 
313,Children really give us the opportunity to see they world in a new light. You are so blessed!
313,Indeed! It is a blessing to have a little human that loves unconditionally. It also gives our family the opportunity to grow by serving.
313,"Yes, I can imagine. Family is one of the most important things in the world to me! Without them, I never would have survived my terrible motorcycle accident."
313,"Wow! You too have your challenges! No one has a perfect life. Like my son, I'm sure you deal with physical and mental therapy to cope."
313,"Yes, My whole left knee is filled with metal. I had to learn to walk all over again. Talk about humbling.."
313,"I'm so sorry, but thankful you survived. We all do our best in life. Although my son is not ""normal"", he too humbles us daily."
313,"Yes, Mary, me too! Having children with developmental disorders is so hard, and unfortunately not everyone is understanding. Blessing to you and your family."
313,Thankfully there are many services and therapies available to help him and us as supportive parents. The schools have also been very helpful in his progress.
313,That's amazing.  I'll bet that some of the educational treatment works for sure.  You are definitely a hero for doing this.
313,Awareness for autism and support for autistic adults is definitely growing. The people working for this are my heroes!
313,That is so true! I think social media has helped spread a lot of awareness about how widespread the disorder is. 
314,It's too early. I miss my old place.
314,It takes time to adapt to a new city. Get involved in some groups to meet like minded people.
314,I'll try. Maybe painting classes. My mom is a painter.
314,"I always admire artists, that eye to hand thing is amazing!  What does she paint?"
314,"Nature!! She is not a Rembrand,but she is doing well/"
314,I love landscapes.  The fall oes especially with the bold reds and oranges. 
314,"I love that also. I used to do walks with my best friend all the time.But she has moved and I moved,so it's hard."
314,"It's hard enough keeping friends as an adult in the same city, but living in different places is worse.  Thank goodness for social media!"
314,"Yess!!!!! 30 years ago, you had to call people or write them,waiting for an answer letter a couple of days."
314,I was a teenager when the internet started to go mainstream.... now I have friends that I met online who come to see me. 
314,I know. I can call my kids in Holland and watch them also same time. Skype.
314,I remember when internet phone services came out and they were sooo crappy! But it was the only way I could call my bf at the time
315,I'll have to. I can't haul vegetables from my garden without it! 
315,I understand. Sometimes I fix also myself my car to save some money.
315,Doing it yourself is always good. I grow my own herbs and vegetables for that very same reason ! 
315,I like to grow my own food as well..  Fresh is the best!
315,My favorite food is raw onion. So fresh is the only ioption! 
315,Raw onion is so good.  Raw garlic too if you can take the heat.  And raw garlic is an antibiotic.  Very good for you.
315,I enjoy growing all different kinds of herbs ! Garlic is a favorite of mine as well! 
315,Do you like chilis as well? I love all spicy food.  Chilis are easy to grow.
315,I love chilis! You can't make a good soup without them ! Do you enjoy bell peppers? There another favorite! 
315,I eat them every day.  That is how I get my vitamin C.   Great for soups or salsa but I usually eat them raw.
315,"They're good raw as well, just like onions! "
315,Great minds think alike!
316,"It's hard when you're in college, especially when breaks/ holidays come. "
316,It is. I have never been on an airplane so it's difficult to see my family who now live in other states during this time of year.
316,"Oh, you know planes are not that scary, you get used to it. "
316,"I am trying to come around to it, hopefully someday it doesn't terrify me."
316,"The thing about planes is they give you small food, and I usually have a starving appetite and eat big meals, because I'm active a lot. Lol."
316,That makes sense! especially longer trips!
316,I'm sorry you don't get to visit family much. I like to video chat with family I can't see often.
316,That's a great way to stay connected for sure! I should do that a little more often with my family!
316,"You should, I use it even if I need help in college with homework or something else, it is so convenient."
316,I agree! I have been thinking of maybe starting a youtube chanel.
316,Oh cool! What would you're YouTube channel be about?
316,I am pretty big on duck hunting season. Maybe it can be based on that.
317,Yes.I was in Chicago last week for a funeral (my dad died) and it's horrible to drive there.
317,I'm so sorry for your loss.  Losing a parent is a hard thing to go through. 
317,"Yes, but it was a peaceful end.He was 87 and died in his sleep."
317,we should all be so lucky... Mine was 45 when he died.  
317,OH.That's way to young. Terrible.
317,"yes, unfortunately the generation above me hasn't been know for their longevity... :("
317,"Well, lets talk about something else. What is your favorite color?Mine is yellow."
317,Teal. :)  Why do you like yellow somuch
317,I don't know. I just love it.Wht's yours?
317,"I don't know, I've always liked the blue greens.  they're just so soothing. "
317,Blue greens?? what is that?
317,"when you have colors that aren't quite blue, but aren't quite green.  so a color between.  Like red orange, or yellow green"
318,Not yet... no new job yet
318,I hope you find one soon. For me I would take the oppurtunity to spend time with my begals Chance and Boomer. Work takes so much time from them.
318,"I know... I like to paddleboard when I have time off, though now I'm bored of boarding!"
318,Keeping busy is good maybe take up a new hobbby. For me my dogs and travling to visit my girlfriend in Salt Lake city takes my not work time.
318,"Well, I do play my piano.... Maybe i could learn a new instrument or travel... but i really need to work"
318,Music is so soothing. I get the need to work but if you have the means to travel do it! You can't take the money with you.
318,"I know, I know... maybe I could find a remote job.."
318,That would be the ideal life work from anywhere. For me it would be a lounge chair on a beach.
318,"For me, it'd be an at-camp office where i can paddle-board!"
318,That sounds nice. We love camping and the dogs love hiking which makes my girlfriend happy she could walk all day. I'd rather relax at camp.
318,"Me too... they can hike and I'll tend the fire - aka, relax!"
318,Exactly - a nice day of chillaxing.
319,I love cooking soul food
319,"I do too! Collard Greens and black eye'd peas, with a bit of corn bread. Yes please!"
319,I like making pizza with a cornbread crust!
319,Oh! I never would have thought to put those two together. You must be a very experimental cook!
319,"yes, i love taking different cuisines and turning them into pizza. do you like pizza?"
319,Yeah!! I think there must be something wrong with a person who doesn't like pizza!
319,I agree with you babe!
319,"Pizza is my lifeblood, along with beer."
319,"I like beer and wine, myself"
319,"Have you ever had a Guiness beer float!? Those are so yummy. Ice cream and beer, who would have thought!?"
319,"no, where can i try it"
319,Its something I like to make for my family (of age of course!!) You just add a scoop of vanilla ice cream to a glass filled with Guiness beer.
320,smores!
320,Smores are good. Love them around a campfire. I have long curly hair so I have to be careful though. 
320,"I have long hair also, so i know the challenges"
320,Yes it can be a torture. Do you buy your own clothes ? I sew mine to save money. Odd maybe but I'm frugal 
320,I'm not that talented! But I do try to repair/patch things as much as i can - part of why i always carry a knife
320,Carrying a knife is smart. Never know when you'll need it. Can even use it to cut the string while you sew! So many uses.
320,Some even have a flint to start fires.... :-/  :-(
320,That's true and when camping that can be useful! 
320,Well yes.  But you have to be careful - i learned the scary hard way
320,Safety should always come first. Whether while using a knife or sewing it is a requirement ! 
320,Safety first... yet people forget that!
320,They do an bad things happen! Why when camping i always keep my long curly hair in a pony tail ! 
321,Toto.  Always one of my favorite songs in high school.
321,"Yes, and I also enjoyed the band Toto, which had a few hit songs."
321,Yep they also did the song Rosanna.  My kids even like that song.
321,"Great song, It was written by a band member who was dating Rosanna Archette at the time."
321,Yes.  I have heard that as well.  What other bands do you like?
321,"I like classic rock bands like The Who, Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones and many more.  What bands do you like?"
321,"Pretty much everything from 50's music to now.  The Beatles, REM, Red Hot Chili Peppers,  Taylor Swift ,  Vance Joy.  I'm all over the pace."
322,Yeah! That sounds great! I love talking to strangers and getting to know new stories.
322,Me too! I meet a lot of cool strangers ta my part time job at the zoo
322,"Oh, I had no idea you worked for the Zoo! Do you have monkeys? Those are my favorite!!"
322,i love monkeys! the koalas are my fave
322,Their noses are so cute! Koalas are adorable!
322,They are! I like to sneak them treats 
322,I bet you are their favorite! You job is so much more fun than mine!!
322,what do you do?
322,I am a janitor at an elementary school... Different kind of monkeys there!
322,"yeah, kids are messy! i have 8 of my own"
322,"You're telling me!! Hah! Wow! Thats a lot of babes, they must love visiting the Zoo with you!"
322,they've been banned. they are truly feral children
323,"I bet that was amazing, especially with how it was filmed in so many places. I love to travel!"
323,"i do love traveling ! i have been over most of america , and also mexico"
323,Me too! I have been to every state except Alaska and that is still on my bucket list.
323,really why not alaska ? i helped start facebook by the way
323,Alaska seems so far away for some reason. Hoping you have benefitted financially from facebooks popularity!
323,I live in Texas so that it really close to me
323,Hmmm. I still think Alaska is far from Texas :) Maybe I'll take a cruise there some day. So are you still involved with facebook?
323,I LOVE RIDING
323,Lol! I have never ridden on a horse. I went to Texas once but never made it to a ranch. Would love to do that someday.
323,where are you from
323,Indiana
323,what is your native place
324,Anna Maria Island!  It's so beautiful there.  Not a lot of people know about it. 
324,Never been but any beach is beautiful in my eyes. 
324,Do you have a favorite?
324,Folly beach in SC they have a great steak and seafood house there. I love my meat so they have the best of both worlds.
324,"Yum!  My brother used to go to Folly a lot, but he's moved now.  "
324,Wish I could live there. But I guess I'll keeping living inland and watching my anime instead of the waves.
324,what are you watching?  I don't watch as much as I used to because gra school keeps me too busy
324,"oh I watch a lot of anime. I watch it theatrically, on television and on the internet too!"
324,what's your favorite?
324,I really like Gail Sidonie Sobat.
324,oh yeah!  I've seen some of her work.  I really like her visual style
324,Its just unfortunate that Ragini died from cancer.
324,that is sad... 
324,"Yeah, she ended up getting pancreatitis when she was 6 and just never recovered unfortunately."
324,cancer's brutal.  I had an uncle who died from pancreatic cancer maybe a decade ago
325,You should definitely wait till you are.  My two boys are a handfull.  But they are also the greatest reward.
325,I'm so lonely here with my computer.
325,Well I guess that is why you are chatting.  Hopefully that makes it a little less lonely.
325,"yeah, i did my degree in math though so i'm used to being lonely"
325,I'm not sure I get that. Why did math make you lonely?
325,all those negative integers
325,LOL.  I guess that could be a danger.  Don't let them get you down.
325,what's your favorite band?
325,Justin Bieber is my favorite artist.  Red Hot Chili Peppers y favorite band.
325,i like the red hot chili peppers
325,Wow!  Great minds really do think alike.

326,"I have never used xbox, but would to try it.  "
326,"You should, it is amazing, I play so often, the novelty of having console games anywhere does not wear off, trust me!"
326,"I believe you.  Actually, I have never played computer video games."
326,What do you do for a living? I'm a welder
326,"I used to work as a business analyst for a large company, but I recently retired.  Welding seems like an interesting job."
326,"its scary , but once I started to get the hang of it I liked it"
326,Good for you.  How long have you been a welder?
326,2 years. How is retirement?
326,"So far so good. I spend a lot of my time outdoors hiking and bicycling.  I can do what I want, when I want."
326,"Yea, you can do whatever you want."
326,"Yes, it is great.  Do you have your own welding business?"
326,"No, it would be great to eliminate the middle man though"
327,"ok, i'm going to help you by going outside and running so i won't be in the way"
327,Thank you for having me clean it up by myself.  
327,anytime! are you done yet? let's dance!
327,Only if we dance to Sunshine Lollipops and Rainbows.  
327,works for me! I love shaking mine and my frieds' booty
327,Shake your money maker ant get down!  You so funny!
327,"tanks, so are you!"
327,When you get back from running you need to help the kids clean their rooms.  Then we'll go.
327,what kids? we ain't bringing no kids
327,We never seem to be on the same page sometimes.
327,it's okay. let the music move us
327,That 's why I like you.  Love the music.
328,what's new in your life?
328,"Lots of work to do these days, how about you?"
328,about the same!  I haven't even gone to the movies in forever. 
328,I love to go to the movies. What do you do for fun?
328,"The movies are my favorite, but then I also like to drive my mustang and hang with my pets... You?"
328,I like to do the same. I have a dog. What pets do you have?
328,"2 dogs, 1 cat.Rose, Daisy, and Mack"
328,I love their names . it sounds like you have a house full. My dog's name is Lionel.
328,Please tell me he's like a golden retriever or blond chow.  great name though!
328,"No, he's part Scottie dog. So I gave him a Scottish name. Do your dogs like to ride in the car with you?"
328,"Yep.  They love to go to the dog park, or to visit family and friends. "
328,"My dog doesnt like to ride in the car, but he's okay if he sits in my lap. He knows when we are driving to the dog park too."
329,i know. they're always curling in the squat rack
329,Well you have to make allowances for age.  You'll be there someday.  My roommate is getting up there.
329,do you like to watch mma? i do
329,I can watch it.  I'm not really into it though.
329,"oh. do you even lift, bro?"
329,I used to.  I gave it up. Those weights are heavy!
329,i love taking my pit bull to the gym
329,I bet the other people there love that.  
329,i don't care whether they do or don't
329,Ok.......   Anyway got to get ready to go to work my part time job.
329,"oh bummer. i used to have one, back when i worked with koalas"
329,Koalas are awesome.  Probably my favorite animal.
330,As a kid I loved dark chocolate 
330,"Dark chocolate is my favorite, but as a kid I preferred milk chocolate.  What type of chocolate do you like most now?"
330,"Definitely Milk Chocolate, they don't really make my favorite candies with dark chocolate. Almond Joy, Twix, M&M...etc"
330,"True, almost all of the popular candy bars are made of milk chocolate.  "
330,Do you have any kids? I have three.
330,I do not have any kids.  How many boys or girls do you have?
330,"One girl and two boys. My first child was a Boy, then girl and then my last son and they are only 1-2 years apart."
330,"Wow, they are spaced close together.  I am one of three boys."
330,"I prefer it that way, they can play together and as they go through obstacles of life and they are able to help each other out."
330,"Yes, they will be both siblings and friends to each other."
330,"It's great. It's time for me to say goodbye, they are hungry and i need to prepare a snack for them."
330,"haha, kids are always hungry.  Bye!"
331,I'm settling in nicely to my new place
331,Where did you move to after the hurricane?
331,I moved over to the uk actually
331,Wow. I want to visit there one day in the future
331,its okay its just very rainy
331,I was told it was much colder and more rainy than Florida
331,at least I don't have to worry about crocodiles in my garden here
331,I have never actually seen one yet. They scare me anyway
331,The scariest things we have over here are hedgehogs
331,Oh... I didn't know those were real.
331,"You should look them up, they're cute but they can be scary"
331,"I will look them up. I hope you are inside, staying dry."
332,"No, it's not creamsicles, but that is good too! It is vanilla ice cream with yellow cake and strawberries mixed in!"
332,that does soun tasy!  My husband likes banana cream pie ice cream. 
332,"Yum! I actually work in a grocery store, so I see all of the best stuff come across my register - items I would never think to try."
332,"cashiering used to make me so hungry :D basically lot's of ""That's new.  I want to eat it now"""
332,"So you worked at a grocery store also? The one I work at requires me to wear all royal blue. Although blue is my favorite color, its a bit much."
332,lol worse.. wal-mart!  So I had to wear blue every day too. 
332,Oh wow! Walmart always advertises for workers and makes it sound like its a great family place to work. I just work at a chain grocery store.
332,"yeah, no they aren't great for their employees unless you're management. they give out foodstamp applications as part of the hiring packet. "
332,"hmmm. Things are not usually as they seem. Well, in any case, we make money for doing what we do. So I am thankful for the grocery store. "
332,"Truth, enough work!  So what do you do for fun?"
332,"Well, I need to focus on doing things that don't cost alot so I like to go on walks and listen to audiobooks! How about you. "
332,I like o kayak on the weekends at the lake near my apartment. 
333,I work at a school...there is software teachers use to check for plagiarism. Be careful!
333,Yes they can catch that pretty easily now.  I never had much problem with that.  I read all the time
333,I learned my lesson and after that I did really well in school. I always tell students not to procrastinate.
333,That is good advice.  Procrastination is one of my shortcomings.  I was going to work on it but I put it off.
333,Ha! What kinds of things do you like to read?
333,Novels mostly. I have been reading Dickens novels lately.
333,I have not read Dickens since school. I love history and am reading about the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s.
333,The Sun also Rises.  Great Hemingway!  If I am remembering correctly  which I may not be.
333,It is Hemingway and yes you are remembering correctly :-)
333,"That""s good.  Thanks for the acknowledgement.  I haven't read it in a long time."
333,The book talks about Hemingway reporting on the war and the crazy partying he did with othe reporters.
333,That's right.  it's all coming back to me.  Have you read Gore Vidals'  Lincoln?  Great history.
334,Must be a beautiful place. Any good places to walk on a sunny day?
334,"Yes, everywhere outside the main towns is an open hiking trail"
334,"Wow that's amazing! i love hiking, it always puts me in a happy mood."
334,Oh me too. I love the outdoors. Watching the Northern Lights is so amazing
334,Can you see the northern lights in most of the ccountry or do you have to go to the very north?
334,"No you can see them less than a hour from Reykjavic, in the right conditions"
334,Is that all year round?
334,During winter is the best time. You can see them frequently from now until March
334,That's awesome. I'm definetely going now. i hear the plane tickets are pretty cheap. 
334,"Budget airlines usually fly there, so tickets should be reasonable"
334,Good to hear. what else is there to do there?
334,So many hot springs and geysers. Always great to watch. They are so active
335,because i had dreams of flying airplanes 
335,"Listened to too much Peter, Paul and Mary growing up? "
335,yes they were very popular in nevada]
335,cool.  Your mom worked in Vegas?
335,"yeah she did, not sure where she went though"
335,"Did you ask the magicians?  Take it from a musician, you should never trust the magicians"
335,"oh really thats an interesting thought, no i never asked the magicians, could you recommend one ?"
335,who was putting on shows at the time?  
335,"I cant remember, i go there sometimes when i fly in with work though and go to the casinos"
335,"well they do change out performers frequently.  Unless you're big name, ya know?"
335,yes i know what you mean. I have been the the UFC a couple of times and i am a big boxing fan
335,who's your fave fighter
336,I have tried a vegan diet but I missed meat too much
336,I actually have gotten very used to no meat. I've found a lot of great substitutes that are nearly as satisfying. The health benefits outweigh the sacrifice.
336,I keep thinking about trying again as meat substitutes are much more tasty than they used to be
336,Go for it! I love dating women and finding unique places that serve what Im looking for while still giving her options.
336,Sounds amazing. I am just calorie counting at the moment. And doing more and more exercise
336,Focusing on fruits and veggies will help a lot with the calorie counting. Its a challenge at first but eating healthy meals at home is the best plan.
336,I will try that as I eat wayyyy too many carbs. And I enjoy cooking from scratch.
336,I substitute spaghetti squash for spaghetti and cauliflower rice for rice. That really cuts down on carbs if you love pasta like I do.
336,Oh pasta is a favourite of mine. Half of my meals are pasta based. I will look into those for sure. 
336,And its awesome that you like cooking from scratch. I cheat and use the Instant Pot for nearly every meal.
336,"Oh don't get me wrong. When I'm busy with work, I cheat too."
336,Have you ever used an instant pot or electric pressure cooker? Its great! Especially as a vegan. Whole veggie meals take only a couple of minutes.
337,"No, I do not.  Do you?"
337,"I do. They are both toddlers, 3 and 4."
337,That is great.  I love kids and hope to have them someday.
337,One day you will.
337,"Thank you, I hope so.  So what do you do for work."
337,I am a stay at home mother who works with my children.
337,That is great.  It must be very rewarding.
337,It is very rewarding. I get to shape their little minds everyday.
337,"Yes, you are definitely shaping the future."
337,I am very much trying for their sake.
337,What do you like to do for fun?
337,I enjoy drinking really good wine.
338,do you not want to listen to it? do you like country music?
338,yes i love country music!
338,"same, any favourite artist of you?"
338,I love luke bryan
338,he is brilliant. i'm a big carrie underwood fan
338,do you know the song hunting fishing loving every day?
338,i know the name but not sure on how it goes
338,"its great, its a good song to listen ot on a road trip"
338,i need to download and have a listen. do you prefer the more modern country to older stuff
338,"i prefer the older stuff, how about you?"
338,i actually the other side and prefer stuff of last 20 years
338,"oh okay, what other music do you like?"
339,"nice, what else do you know about them?"
339,that's about it. what hobbies do you have?
339,"I like studying science, weightlifting, hiking, guitar, gloving and making art.  what do you like?"
339,"besides fishing i like traveling, reading nonfiction, and hanging out with my dog."
339,I like traveling too.  what place do you want to visit more than anywhere?
339,"Japan. I have been to Europe a lot but Japan seems so fascinating and like another planet, almost."
339,Me too!! I'm a huge nerd and I've always wanted to go to Japan.  That country was made for nerds!!
339,Yep I think so too. Plus I really want to ride the super cool high speed train with a view of Mt. Fuji.
339,Tokyo is so crowded that they have hotels with little slide-out cells for people to stay in with only enough room for the person and that's it
339,And there's that giant intersection in Tokyo where during rush hour as many as 3000 people are crossing at one time. Crazy!
339,"it's nothing compared to a city that was once in China.  It's been destroyed, but it had 30,000 people in 5 acres"
339,Wow! How long ago was it destroyed?
339,"no idea, but you can probably look it up"
340,What happened to those poor people puts my problems in perspective.
340,It makes me realize how lucky we really are. I donated to the red cross but still wish I did more.
340,I donated also! I would have given more if I had gotten the promotion I deserved. I have 10 years experience but another woman got the job.
340,At least you were considered for a promotion. I've been stuck in my position for awhile now.
340,"True! Just wish I knew why I was passed by. I believe its because she is prettier, peppier and younger."
340,"If that's the case, you should talk to HR. You could file a suit or get a raise if true."
340,"Hmmm that's food for thought. I am also struggling in my relationship. My boyfriend of 3 years has asked for an ""open"" relationship!"
340,That's a deal breaker right there. Break up with him!
340, I do think you are right on this one. I just need the confidence to move on - to a new job and a new man!
340,It's tough to make a change like that but it'll be long worth it in the coming weeks.
340,Right. Especially when I consider the hurricane victims. I need to make the best of every circumstance. Staying with him is NOT the BEST.
340,Maybe take some time off of everything and move to help the victims. Something that helps not only you but others as well.
341,I mean i will always eat cake when i get the chance
341,not all weddings are the same . what kind of cake ?
341,can't go wrong with a chocolate cake
341,"especially white chocolate... so fattening, but it's the best!! I think so anyways"
341,yes I could eat white chocolate all day
341,"chocolate lava cakes, yum!!"
341,do you like cheesecake?
341,"I do, I get a different kind every time I go to Cheesecake Factory.  The reese's one is my fav"
341,that sounds so good I've never actually tried it
341,"they have like at least 50 different kinds, including a smores one and a carrot cake cheesecake"
341,the carrot cake one sounds nice
341,I also like cheesecake icecream 
342,Sounds like a cool job.  Do you like it?
342,I like it well enough. what do you do?
342,I am a scientist that works in the pharmaceutical industry.
342,that's pretty interesting. Do you work on formulating new medications?
342,"Yes, and testing current medications for quality assurance purposes."
342,That sounds cool and interesting. What did you study in school?
342,Pharmaceutical sciences and Chemistry
342,Cool. what do you like to do for fun?
342,I love playing guitar.  What about you?
342,"I can't play the guitar, but I have always wanted to learn. I love to travel, to read nonfictino, and be with my dog."
342,"You should try, I taught myself through YouTube.  What is your dog’s name?"
342,"Hey, I could probably learn that way too. My dog's name is Lionel. He is a part scottish terrier and part mutt. do you have a pet?"
343,thank you I appreciate the support!
343,You should listen to some music. I always listen to the chainsmokers to cheer up. 
343,"I enjoy the chainsmokers, I saw them live in concert this year"
343,That's awesome! I've been trying to see them but work always gets in the way.
343,I would highly recommend it if you ever have an opportunity. They are really fun live!
343,I'll have to see them this winter. I don't work as much when it's cold outside.
343,Do you have more time off in the winter?
343,Yeah. I work as a lifeguard at a lake so the winter is usually time off. 
343,Yes that makes perfect sense. How do you like being a life guard?
343,It's a pretty good gig. Just wish it payed a little better.
343,Well at least you enjoy it
343,Yeah. What do you do?
344,i like fortnite
344,"I really like classic games a lot like zelda, mario, sonic, spyro etc"
344,its a me mario!
344,How's about a spicya meata balla!! hahaha
344,sombody toucha ma spaghet
344,"look, i you had mom's spaghetti? would you capture it? or just let it slip? (parody of eminem's lose yourself on youtube) haha"
344,hahaha i think we've swayed a bit from video games
344,"well, what if Eminem plays video games?  not too far off hehe.  They should make him a game character"
344,"that's true i bet he does, how could you not play video games"
344,I don't know.  I'm always fidgeting with my hands so it helps me
344,video games are the best!
344,better than the rest!
345,"I enjoy watching my son play, he is a wide-receiver on the team"
345,It's not so popular here in the UK but the game is getting more support year to year.
345,"True, it's not as popular as soccer. Although the NFL has a few games over there every year to try and grow its popularity"
345,"Yes I go watch them every year. I'm going to watch my favourite team, the Jags tomorrow as it happens, in London."
345, Oh they are a fun team to watch
345,"Oh indeed they are. Up one minute, down the next. And college football over there. It's crazy popular"
345,Yeah I like watching the Iowa State Cyclones - that's my favorite college team.
345,I plan to visit the US next year but unfortunately it will be out of season for football. I'd love to watch a college game live
345,Where will you be visiting?
345,"Texas, just before the crazy heat of summer starts"
345,Oh very fun you will enjoy it
345,I think so too. Just need to watch for snakes and spiders
346,I play on a desktop computer. Love it.
346,i used to play on desktop but haven't in ages
346,I mainly look at rocks if im not playing games. Huge paintings would have to be my favourite.
346,very abstract paintings are what i love
346,Same here! I can admire them all day long. 
346,"same, its quite cool"
346,I painted a beautiful waterfall with a wide variety of rocks in the background one time.
346,wow i wish i was able to paint. would be amazing
346,Never too late to learn! the key is to be patient and try to be in a state of 'flow'.
346,i think i may consider looking into starting. the amount of equiptment you need also puts me off
346,That can always be a barrier. I had to invest quite a pretty penny to keep up the habit. No regrets!
346,Its a good habit to get into.
347,I got wasted
347,How was that?
347,it was a lot of fun
347,awesome - Those nights are the best
347,i don't remember a lot of it
347,you must have drank alot
347,"yeah a bit too much, i nearly got kicked out"
347,oh no i bet you got in trouble ! ! !
347,"yeah, I won't be drinking that much agin"
347,"I have never been an alcoholic, but I never drank that much"
347,its fun to drink now and then
347,True that! Are you celebrating anything tonight with a drink?
348,"No because I was close to my building so just walked in really quick, it was too much!"
348,well I'm glad he didn't catch up to you. Who knows what would have happened
348,I know right! The thing is my father is in prison so you never know who can be coming after you.
348,oh jeez haha that's my worst nightmare
348,Yeah it was bad enough that he is not here and now have to watch over my back all the time. Listening to creed helps out with that stress.
348,creed is a great rock band
348,Tell me about it. Listen to them all day.
348,they are so much fun ! ! i used to listen to them wen i was younger
348,"Yeah, im just grateful for youtube!"
348,Yeah I could not imagine life without the internet
348,So many opportunites at a click. Not to mention playlists of creed!
348,very true ! well i have to get going
349,Yeah. Infidelity is a huge problem in this city.
349,i hear some horrible stories that people do to their partners. it's awful
349,My older brother's wife cheated on him. It was heartbreaking.
349,your poor brother. it's better to know in the end but the process of finding out is horific
349,Oh believe me it was. He opened Facebook and found she was seeing other guys.
349,wow. people use technology and forget it's a paper trail of the deception
349,Oh yeah. She thought she was smart but she wasn't.
349,clearly. well she is out of the picture now
349,You could say that. That's for sure...
349,has he been able to move on?
349,Yeah but he's still upset about it. He goes punch dancing in the woods to calm down.
349,i would just be at the gym 7 days a week to let off steam
350,Yeah. It's been really difficult. She's heartbroken. She's been depressed and sleeping alot.
350,i'm sorry to hear that . i'm also struggling here watching my parents in their last moments .
350,Losing a parent is never easy. Especially at a young age. Her mom was the only family she has left.
350,Yeah. It is difficult when you lose someone you're close to.
350,Yeah. Her and her mom use to love going to farmer's markets. Now they won't be able to again.
350,Oh that is so sad! They ought to inspect their animals better before selling them.
350,Yeah. Perhaps they should inspect their animals better.
350,do you have any hobbies?
350,"Yeah. Walking my dog, going to farmers markets and hanging out with my hetro-life partner Silent Bob in front of the QuickStop."
350,that's a good combination . hope everything goes well for you .
350,Thanks. Hopefully the girlfriend will heal in time. In the mean time me and Silent Bob are heading back to LA.
350,I love California.
351,not that I know of.  Apparently I laugh in my sleep. haha
351,"That is pretty funny, to be honest."
351,I must have some hilarious dreams.  I do have some really weird ones
351,Like bad dreams or what?
351,"no, just straight up alice in wonderland weird"
351,ooh thtat sounds almost creepy
351,"it can be, most of the time entertaining though"
351,lol i think snoring is why i do not have a girlfriend right now
351,"yeah, snoring really annoys me.  They make devices that stop it though"
351,"Ah okay, that is good then, I hope they are effective for you!"
351,I'v never used one!! just know about them
351,they can be quite expensive
352,I like meerkats. Cute but vicious. Who is your favourite author?
352,My favorite author is Anne Rice!
352,Good choice. I like the horror genre. Richard Laymon is my favourite.
352,I can't do anything scary. Live alone so it would creep me out all night.
352,"I live alone but I'm the opposite, I love anything scary. Ghosts don't bother me. The living hurt you more."
352,Can't say I disagree with that. I'll stick to my beloved Anne Rice. I have a blow-up doll dressed like her. Too much?
352,Maybe but I've just lost a mouthful of coffee through laughing so much.
352,I hope nothing got on any electronics. Would have had a koala of a time with that!
352,"Haha. No the laptop is safe, it went all down myself. I'll use that though when I next start to write a novel."
352,I will be buying that novel. I work part time so have been writing a little myself.
352,Well I hope it all goes well. You have a creative mind!!
352,"Likewise, we must let our thoughts roam after all."
353,she also writes alot of her songs about her ex-boyfriends
353,I like older music like classic rock and funk the best
353,do you like the eagles band?
353,"yes, but Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin are some of my favorites!!"
353,I love Zeppelin
353,definitely very unique vocals
353,and fantastic instrumentals
353,A song by the Who called boris the spider in 1966 had the very first heavy metal death growl
353,I will have to check that out
353,the video that goes with it is really cute too
353,oh really? Ill check that out
353,I like the Beatles too
354,"That's crazy, right? "
354,Right? You would think! It also boasts the largest city airport system by passenger traffic. Its really amazing!!
354,but nothing is same like it was before 9/11
354,"Exactly, 9/11 changed everything. TSA made air travel worse. It's annoying really."
354,"but there is nothing we can do about it, we just have to get used it, right? "
354,"That's the sad truth. It's been 18 years and I still haven't gotten use to it. I'm barely old enough to remember life before, but it seemed better."
354,it's insane... time flies fast
354,"Yes it does. It seems like only Yesterday, Jeter was still playing, Seinfeld was still on the air and Alice in Chains were a new band."
354,"anyway, I recently a saw really cool video on youtube how to make ginger cookies. "
354,Ginger cookies sound good. They are prefect for the Holiday season.
354,after that I couldn't stop watching make up videos because I will look fat after holidays
354,"Maybe it's an unpopular opinion, but as a guy I like a girl in make up. Girls always look good wearing it."
355,Nowhere but. It helps let nature sink in. Done that before?
355,Back in the day! What else do you like to do for fun.
355,Eating Lasagna. I can't eat it because of the cheese but why eat lasagna without cheese?
355,The whole point of lasagna is the cheese. I guess you can't eat pizza either?
355,Nope. Does it stop me? Nope.
355,Ha. Have you tried vegan cheese?
355,I have. It does'nt have the terrible effects of real cheese though so I stay away.
355,I have tried it before too but it doesn't melt very well so why bother? what do you enjoy eating that doesn't have cheese?
355,The melting quality is what makes cheese if you ask me. I usually have skittles every couple hours. How about you?
355,actually I never eat candy or much sugar. it makes me feel terrible.
355,Same here it really takes a toll on the diabetis. Have you tried vegan brownies?
355,I have tried them. They're actually not bad. 
356,"when people make their bed it creates a better breeding ground for mites, so it's actually better to not make your bed"
356,"we should really do something with that, I am allergic to dust!"
356,that sounds really unpleasant!!
356,but the worst part is you have to clean every day and keep the flat tidy all the time. 
356,yikes!! there's worse allergies than that though.  I've heard of being allergic to water
356,allergic to water? so you have to drink vodka instead? 
356,"I have no idea, as far as I know it's not a deadly allergy.  Just constant mild symptoms"
356,that must be why i did not know !
356,what if someone was allergic to  themselves?
356,"well, what if I am allergic to myself?"
356,I don't know.  Dust contains dead skin cells so you're constantly surrounded by yourself
356,by dead parts of me. 
357,She's very bipolar. Sometimes she goes on these crazy spending binges.
357,Bipolar must be difficult. Not knowing which person you are going to get.
357,"Yeah. I love her, but it's not always easy. Sometimes she's super creative and loves writing. Others shes really depressed and that usually leads to shopping binges."
357,Is she on medication for her condition?
357,She is. Sometimes she forgets to take it though. Other times I'm not sure if it works. She does see a Therapist though.
357,"Maybe it's time to convince her to try a different medication, perhaps? Or meditation?"
357,"She does meditate from time to time. However, she has a hard time sticking with it."
357,Is there some sort of positive reinforcement you could try? Maybe a gift card to spend as she likes when she has not 'binged' for a specified length of time?
357,I  do from time to time. I bring her flowers and try to get her out of the house
357,Is there a better way to control your funds so she can't shop you out of house and home?
357,I hate to do this because she is my wife. But I'm thinking about setting up a seperate account.
357,I think that's a good idea. I would think she'll understand
358,Oh no.Not rap.I'm a country music man
358,"I'll drum, you sing. And I love koala's. What about you?"
358,i'm trying to remember what koalas eat?eucalyptus leaves?
358,mainly yes. They look so cute when eating. Have you seen a hippo before?
358,Don't tell me you thin hippos are cute?They're killers.I think they kill more people each year in africa than crocodiles
358,They are cute in their own way I guess. Saw one at a zoo last year after doing a show.
358,"well all baby mammals are cute. hippos,rhinos,elephants,leopards.you don't want to meet them when they are all grown up but as babies they're adorable"
358,Did you ever notice how active they are during the day? Powerhouses for sure.
358,yes.which zoo were you at last year?
358,Toronto zoo in Canada. There was also pandas at the time which everyone was lining up to see.
358,"that must have been great.pandas?let's see.they eat bamboo,right?"
358,Yes they do. About 20-40 pounds of it each day. Which is rediculous don
359,that's why people were laughing all day
359,i've done worse.  i accidentally made the tea upside down at work
359,i  don't cook at all. I always have to eat out
359,i hate cooking too!!
359,I don't cook since I almost cooked my dog because i forget my contact lenses 
359,wow!! thats crazy!! glad your dog is okay
359,i know!! I love my dog
359,"i love dogs, i love cats more!!"
359,"i don't like cats, they so arrogant and think they are in charge. "
359,i like them because im an introvert
359,do wear glasses or contact lenses? 
359,"i wear glasses, my eyesight is horrible!!"
360,"I speak greek, slovak, polish, czech, russian, italian "
360,"That's really impressive you know so many, did you ever study languages scientifically, also known as linguistics?"
360,i had to overcame cancer when i was 18
360,OH WOW! THat's insanse. It must have been hard having cancer at such a young age.
360,"it was horrible, i am on low carb diet now"
360,Does a low carb diet help? Do you feel healthier?
360,i feel amazing now 
360,Awesome. I'm glad the low carb diet works. I love pasta too much to try it.
360,i used to eat out all the time and not exactly healthy so maybe that's why i had cancer. 
360,Perhaps. I need to eat out less. It costs too much.
360,"you can make pasta at home, it's cheap and easy to make. "
360,Yeah. I do from time to time. I get a little lazy sometimes though. Plus their is a great mom & pop Italian resturant down the road from me. 
361,hiking in some mountains nearby. I'm taking my dogs.
361,Sounds fun! Recently unemployed so going to add hiking in mountains on my list of to-do's. What dogs you have?
361,"two terrier mixes, one black, one tan. they love to hike with me."
361,I bet that makes them very happy. Got a husky here who loves hiking.
361,I have a friend with a husky that loves to run long distances and hike too. 
361,They love to pull so I have a great workout partner. Do you go on hikes often?
361,I try to. It's hard during the work week. But it's good to get my dogs out for lots of exercise.
361,I'm sure they love doing anything that involves moving around. What do you feed them?
361,More people food than I should ;-) actually they really love baked sweet potatoes. 
361,I like that as well. Definately won't be giving doggo that. He sensitive.
361,my dogs were both rescues so they will eat anything they can. they must have been hungry a lot as strays.
361,Good on you for rescueing. I'm sure it was a hard time for the poor babies.
362,What is a stifle worker? I have only 3 toes on my right foot. No problems with my job as a zookeeper. 
362,I don't even know what stifle means. haha
362,Lol! Maybe ask your dad. I'm curious. The animals that keep me company don't care at all about my missing toes. 
362,"thats cool, what's your favorite animal?"
362,"In my home, my favorite animal is a dog. I have a shih tzu. At the zoo, my favorite animal is the elephant - gentle giant."
362,I love elephants.  Theyre one of the smartest animals.  They mourn their dead
362,I know! They are so very intuitive too. They seem to know how I am feeling and respond to it. Do you have a job?
362,"no, I'm trying to get on social security.  I wouldnt mind caregiving though. super laid back"
362,Caregiving is important. I imagine it takes a lot of patience and an attitude of service.
362,"my roommate does it and i shadowed him, thats why i want to do it.  it's almost not a job what he does"
362,What qualifications does it take?
362,a background check and pass an easy test that you get to study for
363,"From Canada, yourself? Mellow as in down to earth im guessing."
363,USA
363,What are your hobbies? I really like being an employee.
363,"I'm 71, too old for hobbies. "
363,May as well tell me your too old for life haha. When was the last time you danced?
363,When I was around 8 years old.
363,"I like to ask elderdy, any regrets from life?"
363,"my favorite food to harvest is carrots, perhaps I should have tried potatoes. "
363,Why not try them all? I get most of my fruits and veggies from farmers markets.
363,"Yes agree, I like the baby carrots there easier for me to eat."
363,Do you make any kind of veggie/fruit smoothies at all? Love waking up to that.
363,"yes , i like fresh mango and orange juices"
364,"i might not know my whole family, but my friends treat me like family"
364,That's awesome! I also have some very good friends. I am married also and have 4 children now. So blessed!
364,"nice, i just have a boyfriend and we're not really the parenting type because we are kind of like kids ourselves!!"
364,You may find that that will change as time goes on. I still act like a kid sometimes too as I drive a red sportscar and wear red converse shoes.
364,"it wont change, i'm autistic"
364,"Oh wow! One of my son's is autistic. He is such a blessing to all of us. If you are like him, he is so intelligent and so loving!"
364,"i am, and im an empath.  its really intense sometimes!!"
364,I can imagine! I am so thankful that there is such a growing awareness and appreciation for special souls like you and my son.
364,"it took me a long time to accept my diagnosis, but im blessed now.  my partner also has it!!"
364,That must be be both a challenge and a blessing. You understand each other!
364,"i refused to have a partner like that before him, but it's way better this way"
364,Thank goodness you found each other. Hopefully you are both benefitting from resources that enhance your lives.
365,Does a bird have wings? Do Tornadoes spin?
365,Ha! what's your favorite snack while you are watching sports and drinking beer
365,Probably cheetos and pita's with hummus. How about you?
365,I like hummus and pita too. i also like to make wings in my pressure cooker.
365,Love those things. My mom makes wings like that every other week.
365,"Yeah they are awesome. they cook fast in the cooker, then you add sauce and put them in the oven. do u like ranch or blue cheese better?"
365,Blue cheese all day. Don't mind some buffalo or honey garlic either. You?
365,"Blue cheese here too, with buffalo. And celery. The celery makes it practically health food."
365,"Haha, ofcourse it does. Do you ever have potatoe wedges with wings? So good!"
365,"No, never tried that before. I usually like sweet potato fries better than regular fries or potatoes."
365,That was my mentality too. Until I started making homemade wedges with spicy sauce and tzaziki.
365,That sounds awesome! I love tzaziki. Never had it with fries before!
366,I love Madonna. 
366,Madonna is awesome! Love her sense of style. Do you like Lady Gaga too?
366,"no, i hate lady gaga, that's just too much for me. "
367,"They never stop needing clothes, when growing or when adulting. Do yo play sports?"
367,I am not much of  a sports buff. I spend a lot of time on the computer doing blogging.
367,Im not too active either just a little tennis with the family every week. What kind of blogs?
367,"I mostly blog about peoples llifestyles. Where they travel, work, etc. Do you read any blogs?"
367,Sounds like you learn a lot. Mainly fitness and business ones. Prefer videos.
367,Do you workout? I have recently tried yoga and I'm really enjoying it.
367,"I try different classes often, you should try hot yoga. Never enjoyed it more."
367,What is hot yoga? I haven't heard of it. I also like to walk. I have 2 dogs so I do a lot of it!
367,As long as your moving! Hot yoga is yoga in a hot environment. You burn a lot of fat.
367,That sounds great! I could sure use to burn some fat!
367,As long as you keep moving around you will have no problem with that! Good luck!
367,"Thank you for your suggestion!  I really like Hatha yoga, maybe  you could find a class."
368,She loved to go for walks. I went on many hikes with her that I wouldn't have done by myself.
368,I bet she was so happy doing that with you. It sounds like she had a good life and was well loved.
368,"I live by the ocean and she loved the beach too. And belly rubs! Such a sweet dog, she never hurt any living creature."
368,Dogs become part of the family and losing them is so hard. Sometimes all you can do is know that your dog knew she was loved. 
368,"Thank you for understanding that she wasn't ""just an animal"". Do you have pets?"
368,"I have a scottish terrier mix. He is black and gray. He sleeps under the covers with me, so he's definitely spoiled. ;-)"
368,"Oh, sweet! It's so nice to cuddle with a pet when you're sleeping. My dog was too big but my cat sleeps in my arms :)"
368,"My dog likes to sleep right up next to me. Sometimes his snoring wakes me up. Do you think that one day, you would like another dog?"
368,"Oh yes, I'll need another dog to keep me hiking and to keep my cat company. They were best friends :/"
368,We used to have a cat. Our dog always wanted to play with him. The cat would play...for about thirty seconds. Then he had enough.
368,"Aw, poor doggie! They always look so sad when someone won't play with them. I hope they were friends otherwise."
368,"They were. The cat just liked to mess with the dog! You know how cats are, always want to be in control."
368,"They always ARE in control. Of the humans, too! ;)"
369,I'd love to make some money walking your dog! How far do you walk him?
369,2 hours every morning. He is young and very playful
369,"That would be great, I can do that. $50 per hour sound good?"
369,$100 per walk is what you are asking correct? What was your last job?
369,Last job was $50 but I only walked them one hour.
369,I assume you are living in a  good neighborhood. You give training as well? 
369,"It's decent, middle class. I'll do my best to get him to sit, roll over and come if I can."
369,I wont be able to afford you but can recommend. You have been in this for a while? 
369,"I've been doing it for about 10 years, off and on."
369,Wow I am impressed. How did you end up having free time? People must be  in queue for you
369,They are; I've been quite fortunate. I work during the evenings and nights as a bouncer so have lots of day time to spare.
369,I am impressed
370,"That's pretty cool, I'd love to learn. Do you offer lessons?"
370,I am not certified but can suggest many places. Where will you have your next summer holiday? 
370,"Australia, can you recommend someone there?"
370,Hey this is huge. Will you travel or stay at one place? 
370,Travelling around the northeast coast
370,I am actually looking for a place to stay there this summer as well. When approximatelly will you be there? 
370,"Around the middle of January, are you there just for surfing?"
370,I am planning to open a juicing bar on the beach
370,"Oh wow I'll definitely have to visit; love some good fresh juice drinks, especially with a good barbeque!"
370,SurfnSmoothie :) Lets exchange contacts and see you there. You will love it I can assure you
370,"Oh yeah, that would be awesome; will you have a BBQ joint too? I do love some BBQ"
370,"Oh yea, bbq all day :) but you cant be on the waves with full stomach :) "
371,I just finished the best book about a guy who took an epic kayaking trip.
371,Really? Where did he go?
371,To Thailand
371,"That must have been really cool. I've never been to Asia, have you?"
371,"No but I would love to go, it"
371,"I would too. I'd love to see all of East Asia, but especially Japan."
371,"It's on my bucket list, I went to New Zealand last year and it was amazing"
371,"I've always wanted to go there too, it looks so beautiful in pictures and the movies. How long were you there?"
371,"I went for two weeks, it's such a long flight I'm glad I stayed the full two weeks"
371,Definitely. I never saw the point of going to a foreign country for 2 or 3 days. What was your favourite part?
371,Sydney was a fun town and the scenery was beautiful
371,Did you spend a lot of time at the beach or do you prefer the city?
372,I love that genre of music. Do you like jazz?
372,"Yes! I really like jazz, blues, and swing - anything with a good piano does it for me. What about you? "
372,Lately I have really been into '80s music. What kind of foods do you enjoy?
372,I'm really into korean lately. I spent a year there and it's all I think about now lol. How about you? 
372,I love really hot chicken wings. I am from Buffalo so you almost have to like them!
372,"My only problem with wings is that I'm lazy - I always opt for boneless if I can. Call me a sinner but hey, I just want to eat! "
372,I absolutely understand. A lot less messy too! What do you do for a living?
372,I have my own clothing brand! I make my own clothes and make a decent side hustle selling them to others as well! You? 
372,That sounds like a lot of fun! Right now I am driving a truck for a company in Florida. 
372,How do you feel about our president moving to the state of Florida? I live in AL so it was a close call lol 
372,It seems he feels people will be nicer to him in Florida. I will tell you that his house in Palm Beach is really something to see.
372,He has said he will run again next term. Do you think he has a chance of getting re-elected? I'm hoping Yang wins TBH 
373,Do you camp or do you just go for day hikes?
373,I usually just spend the day but camping would be fun.  I'd like to visit the Grand Canyon and camp there.
373,"I didn't know you could camp there! Careful you don't fall out of bed & roll off the edge, it's a long way down. ;)"
373,"My husband has done a river rafting trip on the Grand Canyon, it's on my bucket list."
373,What else is on your bucket list?
373,"I've never been to Yosemite either, it looks amazing."
373,Is that the place with the huge geyser?
373,"No that's Yellowstone, I've been there.  The thing I loved the most about Yellowstone was the buffalo."
373,A home where the buffalo roam! Have you ever been to the Rocky Mountains?
373,"Yes, my favorite.  I just got back from Rocky Mountain National Park.  It was beautiful in the fall."
373,Fantastic! I love Banff and Jasper.
373,Where is Jasper?  
374,I didn't know it was going in all ancient cultures but yeah I do.
374,I am surprised that take out was a concept found in ancient cultures.  I thought it would have started in the fast food era.
374,I would think so too. Honestly I wouldn't know much anyway all I do is play video games.
374,what games do you like
374,I love dark souls. It's really hard but super satisfying. It takes my mind if of a lot of things.
374,my sons are pretty young but they are into Minecraft.
374,I love that game too. I'm glad they like it because Minecraft can really draw from creativity in someone.
374,Do you have any other hobbies?
374,Aside from working all the time I like to play virtual really for exercise.
374,what kind of work do you do
374,I set up architectural plans to be drawn on by designers digitally
374,that sounds cool. Is that CAD?
374,Sometimes but I mostly use Revit
375,Yeah for sure. It's hard to find somone that shares my weird hobbies like surgery videos and anything sharp and dangerous haha
375,"Seriously, hang in there you'll find someone."
375,Lol thanks - what are some of your hobbies? What do you think about mine? 
375,I faint at the sight of blood so surgery videos are so not my thing.  I like to spend a lot of time outdoors.  
375,Do you do a lot of hiking then? Maybe we share an interest in machetes or axes or knives? 
375,I do carry a knife when I hike.  I never know what's coming around the corner especailly because I can't hear anything coming.
375,What kind of knife? What about when it comes to EDC or personal defense? 
375,Just a pocket knife
375,"Okay, but what about when it comes to personal defense? Or only just hiking? "
375,I have never really thought about using a knife for personal defense
375,Not even that - they can be practical for opening boxes or cans in a pinch. Always good to have one :) 
375,I agree.  You never know when you might need one in an emergency - never really thought about it like that.
376,It is really beautiful. What did your mom and dad do for a living?
376,"We lived in an extremely rural area and it just was more practical for us. Also, my mom was an educator by profession."
376,"My mom too! She is retired now, but was a school teacher for many years."
376,"that is awesome, what is she doing now?"
376,She is retired but she does knitting as a hobby and has gotten really good at it! She sells some of her stuff.
376,That's really cool! Does she sell any knitted items online?
376,"Not yet, but I'm trying to help her. What does your dad do?"
376,"He's retired now, but he used to be an emu rancher."
376,"Well that is an interesting profession. My dad was a police officer, he is also retired."
376,That can be a dangerous job. Did you worry about him when you were a kid?
376,"I did to a degree, it wasn't as scary back then as much as it is now. Where was your dad a rancher?"
376,"The family ranch was in West Texas, but due to financial reasons, they had to sell it."
377,About three years. I am so happy! 
377,That's great! Congratulations!
377,Thank you. I wish you as much happiness! Are you in a relationship?
377,I am! We are pregnant with twins! :) Due to minor complications the Dr. currently has me on bed rest.
377,"That's fabulous, I mean the pregnancy not the complications! I hope you'll be feeling better soon."
377,Thank you so much! Any timeline on the wedding? Such an exciting and life changing event
377,We're thinking of doing it in the spring so the weather won't be too hot or cold. When are you due?
377,That's a great time for a wedding! I am due in December. We have about 5 weeks left to go and I can't wait. It's an exciting time of year!
377,"Congratulations, you'll have a couple of baby Capricorns! ;)"
377,"OMG, I know! My brother is a Capricorn. One of my favorite personalities"
377,"Yes, you can always count on a Capricorn. My girlfriend is one as well."
377,They're the best! Congratulations again! Wishing y'all the best :)
378,"Really? That's interesting. Besides eating, what are your hobbies? Do you play runescape by any chance? "
378,I don't play any video games to be honest.  I like to spend time outdoors.
378,I do too - unfortunately if I spend too much time outdoors my breathing acts up and I have to use my inhaler :( 
378,"That does make it tricky.  I spend a lot of time running, tying to keep in shape."
378,That's great. I spend time weightlifting and playing badminton - I'm in the best shape I've been in all my life! 
378,Badminton - that's interesting.  How did you get into that?
378,I was born in the philippines and it has always been the only sport that interests me. My uni also has a club here! 
378,Is it good excersice? I'm always looking for fun ways to keep in shape.
378,yes!!! it burns like 550 calories an hour. Have to be careful about your joints and racket arm though. 
378,"I'm in, have you ever played volleyball?  A girl who I was in pageants with introduced me to it."
378,Not for real - I don't like watching it nor playing it tbh. It takes skills though and makes for great lower body workout!
378,Its fast paced which is why I like it.  
379,Tell me about your profession 
379,He is a Scottish sculptor as well as an installation artist.
379,Art is so beautiful. As a chef I have the upmost respect for David Mach 
379,Who is he that you are speaking about?
379,"The one you speak of, the Scottish sculptor. I myself am a classically trained chef from baton roug   "
379,"Wow, sounds pretty impressive!"
379,It has its perks. Tell me more about yourself 
379,i am a freelance musician and voice over actor
379,Thats cool! I love the fact that you work for yourself. 
379,"thank you , it was great getting to know you david ."
379,Have a great day
379,You as well. Have a great day.
380,"I guess your right, I'm always in such a hurry."
380,"Yea, it's not enough that you drive safe sometimes."
380,"I hope this rain stops eventually, we could use some sunshine."
380,"Well, it's not all bad as rain helps with crop irrigation and provides water for hydroelectric power plants."
380,That's true but the sunshine is good for my soul.
380,i suppose you are right about that .
380,"The kids love it too, I can't take rescheduling practice again this week."
380,Hopefully we will have sunshine this week then
380,The weather looks better towards the end of the week for sure.
380,Good. Do you have any plans for the weekend?
380,Lot's of soccer games scheduled but I would like to try and find sometime to get to the beach.
380,that does sound like fun . the beach is relaxing .
381,No they were old beenie babies! My boyfriend in the army gave them to me before being deployed. 
381,Are you going to sell them? 
381,"If they are of a good value. They are just sitting around now, I might as well!"
381,"Yea moneys tight, you might as well make sure extra cash. I got work tonight, kill me.  "
381,Lol that escalated quickly. Where do you work? I have to keep my hair short for my job :( 
381,I work graveyard shift at some snobby hotel. 
381,Must be tough.I work in catering so having short hair is just easier for sanitation. What do you do at the hotel? 
381,Iv been a dishwasher for two years now. It pays the bills :*( 
381,"I understand that. As soon as the bf gets back home, I think I'll go back to college and get a masters!"
381,I think thats a really great idea. Im working to go snowboarding. I love the snow! 
381,where do you want to go snowboarding? climate change is making it harder to do that :(
381,Im actually really happy that your talking about climate change. I usually go to orangeville in ontario 
382,How long have you been vegan? I have been for about 10 years now.
382,I'm relatively new. only 18 months
382,As time goes on you will get more creative with meals. I love to read vegan cook books in my spare time.
382,i haven't read many. do they give you tips on alternative options?
382,Yes they do! I have even made some delicious vegan desserts using chick peas!
382,Yum! well i need to start looking on amazon for what's available
382,Amazon is a great place to find cookbooks. You can download the kindle too.
382,i don't have a kindle. still old school with paperback books
382,I like to pick up a real book also. There is something great about turning the pages.
382,make you feel like you've fulfilled a task
382,Exactly! What do you like to read?
382,i really enjoy thrillers and law based books
383,"It's where you dress up like characters in movies, tv, or video games."
383,"Oh sure, I love dressing up! Did you dress up for Halloween? I was a space alien."
383,Yeah I dressed as a friar. I had a robe left over from the last renaissance fair I went to.  
383, I love the old fashioned theme. What was your favorite thing at the fair?
383,"Well, I enjoy the whole experience... But I REALLY like to watch the jousting contest. It's crazy!"
383,Jousting? Sounds a bit dangerous! Have you done it yourself?
383,"We used to bicycle joust using hockey sticks when I was a kid, but I never tried the real thing."
383,I love the look of the renaissance costumes. Maybe I'll try it myself sometime. Do they sell mead? I love mead.
383,They do! I've only had it once or twice. Are there any brands that you'd suggest to a newbie?
383,"Sorry I'm a newbie myself, only had it at a dinner party once. Would love to try again though"
383,That's OK. It's not something you see too often. 
383,"No, that's why I was curious about the fair. The costumes are beautiful too. How many fairs have you been to?"
383,I've only been to a few. There's a pretty great one in Waxahatchie TX every May. You should check it out!
384,I've never been to Seattle but I love the Coast
384,I love to take road trips so I visit when I can. Being a meeting coordinator offers me the ability to do so :) 
384,"Me too, I like to stop at interesting places along the way.  One time I spent a week following the Oregon Trail."
384,What about any other trails? And wow the famous oregon trail lol. Ever played the game? 
384,Oh my gosh I love that game.  Played it as a kid - it was what got me into history in the first place
384,Really? That game was past my generation and i just know of it because of the books lol 
384,"Too bad it was super fun, I wonder if there is still a version of it out there."
384,"I'm sure there is, did you ever make it to the end tho? "
384,I can't remember I just remember I loved the adventurous part of the game.
384,Have you ever done any traveling outside of the states? 
384,"I just got back from Australia it was amazing, how about you?"
384,Where in AU? I just got back from a year in Korea!
385,I actually love all animals. I grew up on a farm.
385,Thats really cool. I grew up in the city so iv only seen small pets. What animals did u have on the farm?

386,i'm from tennessee so very interested in its origins
386,I'm from Kentucky and my parents still live there. You'd think I would love bluegrass but metal is my favourite :)
386,that is surprising. Metal is a little too intense for me
386,One positive thing about metal is that it has its roots in blues. Do you like blues music?
386,i love blues singers. I don't know many of the guitarists and drummers of the genre
386,"You may have heard some of them, here's a few: Joseph Williams (vocals), David Paich (keyboards), Steve Porcaro (keyboards), and Steve Lukather (guitars)."
386,i know the Steves but don't know their songs or music
386,Never heard Africa by Toto? That's Steve Porcaro
386,oh no way. yeah love Africa. never knew who played that haha
386,They really knew how to write a song. Are you older?
386,i'm 33 so know Africa from the radio
386,"Rosanna's a good song too, but sounds so much like Africa"
387,"Me and my gf broke up. I was weak and selfish, but it was time for a change. "
387,"Wow, way to accept responsibility.  All you can do is move on.  What makes you miss your old house?"
387,I think of my memories with her. My heart hurts still but it was a broken relationship and was a matter of time I think. 
387,Best that you are in a new place.  How long ago did you break up?
387,"It was about 2 months ago. We had been dating for over a year though. Enough about me though, what about you? "
387,I've dated here and there but still looking.  I'm thinking of starting my own business and that takes a lot of my time
387,What kind of business? I'm a bit of an entrepreneur myself. 
387,Baking has been my hobby for a long time but I'm thinking of jumping in to making cakes maybe start small with catering gigs.
387,Oh wow! I shoot wedding photo/videos. My whole life is just about love I guess lol 
387,That must make it hard watching all those people in love and going through a break up.
387,"It gives me hope if anything. Sometimes I'm jealous but it reminds that in our casual sex-laden world, real love exists still. "
387,It sure does - you'll get there.  I'll make your wedding cake when you do.
388,Its always sad to see someone so admired and respected to pass away. 
388,"It really is. She really meant the world to me, I used to dream about meeting her!"
388,Keep your head up. Just remember her for what she stood for. 
388,I really do. My mother has Alzheimer's so I understand the disease.
388,My grandfather did as well. Its really sad to see them deteriorate like. Science is getting better so there is hope.  
388,"I do believe that there is hope. I am sorry its taking so long to respond, I wish my computer was a bit faster."
388,Its all cool. Did you know my character has three thumbs.  
388,"What character are you referring to? Three thumbs, I am intrigued!"

389,I do too - my two cats don't seem to like their lol 
389,"Haha, I think cats prefer easy listening ;)"
389,Maybe - or maybe its the kale I'm always feeding them LOL 
389,Kitties on kale? Mine would start a revolution :D
389,LOL. I LOVE Kale and it's super healthy. Try sneaking it in with some tuna or salmon. How many cats do you have/ 
389,Five! They grew up together so they love each other and never fight. How about you?
389,OMG WHAT? I have just two. They're a handle enough already. What are their names?

390,Summer camp sounds interesting. Where do you go?
391,"Yes, I have three dogs."

391,Lol that’s a good one I work from home since I take care of mom and dad full time

392,"That is really sweet! They are such amazing companions. They also help in hunting, aiding people with hearing issues, and search and rescue efforts!"

393,That's nice that you have family to spend time with. I love Netflix
393,Do you spend time with your family? What do your parents do for a living?
393,"They're retired and getting older.  I help around the house and make sure they are Ok, they need more help then they used to."
393,It is tough seeing your parents get older. My father is still working at a very prestigious job.
393,That's nice what does he do?
393,He is a dean at a college in Vermont. My mom is retired now.
393,Do you visit them if Vermont often? It's so pretty up there.
393,I love it this time of the year. The leaves are absolutely amazing!
393,"I also love it in winter, skiing is the best.  They have great pastries in Vermont."
393,Believe it or not I have never skied. Maybe you could take me sometime.
393,"Perfect we can stay at your parent's house, I'll just need to get someone to stay with parents"

396,I take medication that makes me very hungry! I love snack food also.
396,Good thing you can burn it off with all that running.
396,"I will never give up running, unless my knees give out."
396,I hear that starts to happen as we get older.  Better pick up something that is easier on the body.
396,I would love to try cross country skiing. I just don't want to live in the cold climate year around.
396,I do like warm weather best - how about snorkeling?
396,I live in Florida and snorkel all the time. We have some great reefs.

398,Sounds like it would be a great time.
399,"They are amazing, but I don't have time to have a cat because I'm always working."
399,Same! Travelling to work takes forever and honestly they need a lot maintenance 
399,For sure! It wouldn't be fair to have a cat and leave it alone all day.
399,i know right ? do you work ? Sometimes i have lazy days and it wouldn't be fair on the cat
399,"I am a basketball coach and I work literally all day every day, life is non-stop for me!"

401,I can't believe slavery would still exist anywhere in the world.
401,It's awful! My husband did a charity organisation to bring awareness and help those who were affected 
401,It really is. I know from first hand experience how it is to be a slave. I am so thankful to no longer be in that situation.
401,"No, I'm so sorry to hear that! It would be rude to ask but when exactly was this?"
401,I was a slave for 10 years in Africa. I escaped 5 years ago from Africa with the help of these Christian missionaries.
401,"Before I met my husband he was also involved in these, however he can't travel due to responsibilities here"
401,He was involved in missionaries?
401,Yeah he works at the local Church and he did some work with missionaries. But the little ones don't let him go
401,That is amazing. I owe my freedom to people like him. I definitely understand kids keeping him home now. 
401,What about yourself? Any significant other? I'm just happy you escaped and started a new life here!
401,"Yes, I met my husband here 2 years ago. Thank you. I truly have  a great life now. We are hoping to have a child soon."
401,"Good luck, I think that's fantastic!! Do you think you would adopt, have a surrogate or try donor insemination?"
402,She drives a Subaru Outback.
402,Oh that's a fun car.  I drive a Cadillac Escalade.  It's a big car.
402,Yeah the Escalade is big.  I bet it is a plush drive.  How long have you had the Escalade?

403,That is awesome. I wish I could play an instrument but my talents seem to be with numbers which is why I am great at couponing. 
403,That's useful! I would love to learn how to coupon better
403,Find a copy of the ABC nightline episode extreme couponing to give you some tips. Love doing it so I can donate to help others. 
403,"That's so sweet. I might look into that, it seems interesting. I like the idea of saving money in general"

405,"No, she is doing fine now. Such a crazy kitty. Have you ever had any problems with your pets?"
405,Yeah.  It was sad.  One day my two cats decided they hated each other after years of no problems. 
405,What? that's quite strange. how long have you had your cats?
405,It was like 8 years. I don't have them anymore.

405,Sounds so cute. What personalities do British blues have?
405,"Well, I am no cat expert, but they make good house cat's and mine is quite calm"
405,Sounds like the perfect cat.
405,"Yes, it has been my dream cat for a while. Such beautiful big eyes"
405,Are they expensive?  You said you saved up?

407,LOL.  I had one growing up.  I miss him.
407,I got her in England . She cost a bit to bring to states but worth it all. Had a cat when she was a puppy but guess she forgot
407,They get jealous easily
407,Hopefully they will learn to get along with each other  and she wont have more intentional accidents in the house
407,They will end up being best friends before you know it
407,sure hope so . I have missed having a cat around. I had my last one for 17 years
407,The last cat I had passed awy young and never got another
408,ohh thats a cool city!why is it named so?

408,"my husband also tells me to do so,he is health consious afterall"
409,"Those are the one's that like to argue with the judges about how they're ""on key"" and how they have perfect pitch. lol"
409,I could never ever sing in front of people like that. 
409,I am fine in the choir but for sure am not a soloist!

419,"It is indeed ,you should always ask her out in private. well i never proposed a girl but i can advice,i think"
419,"I will keep your advice in mind, thank you. I am shy around women since I don't have good eye sight and my friends take me places."
419,"i understand you, we have similarities "
419,It is hard to ask a person out in private with friends and family always around. How would you suggest I do it next time?
419,"if you think that she doesnt really like you ,she doesnt laugh on your jokes,doesnt ask you lot of question then dont ask her out"
419,"Makes sense, but I really felt we had a good connection. I guess I was wrong."
419,yeah sometimes we make  mistake understanding the type of connection.
419,Not the first time and I am sure not the last. I will not let that stop me from asking others out. There is someone for me out there.
419,"yeah thats the spirit , i wish i was that confident i couldnt have ended up marrying arsh"
419,All they can do is say no. Have confidence. You never know unless you ask. You can get to know more people that way.

420,"Yeah, I'm not going there. I have actually been married for 8 years. Sorry I lied about that."
420,Really! Why did you say that?
420,I was afraid. But I shouldn't be.
420,"Afraid of what, the truth?  Why would you not want to be honest?"
420,Not afraid of the truth... How do you get closer to someone? I don't mean to not be honest.
420,"Are you married or not? If you are married, you should stay true to your spouse."

422,"Yes, he had to raise me after our parents passed away. He did his best."
422,Sounds like you turned out well.

427,"Yeah, the wood quality and the brush hairs can make all the difference with certain brush strokes styles."
427,"Yes, my neighbor is an artist and I heard her talking about that through the fence to her artist group. They spend a fortune on brushes."
427,"Oh man, the paints can get exorbitant too, especially those with cobalt."
427,Yes! Good luck with your collecting. It was nice talking to you.
428,My son did not mention he was stopped by the police for speeding last week.
428,Did he get a ticket or did they let him off with a warning?
428,This will be his second ticket in 3 months.
428,How old is your son? Does he still live with you?
428,"Yes, he is 17 years old."
428,"You should ground him for a while, multiple tickets that close together is pretty serious. You don't want him to lose his license."
428,"You are correct.  Not only is he grounded, he is unable to use the car for quite some time."
428,"Hopefully he learns his lesson, his safety should be a priority."
428,We explained his safety and that of others are our main concern.
428,"That's good. He's still in high school, right? I used to play soccer in high school."
428,"Yes, he is and a very good student athlete.  He made a bad choice and have to learn from the consequences."

429,"you should do it ASAP, well it depends where do live or work,because for me carrying a gun is so important"
429,I learned to shoot a gun in the military so I have had lots of practice. My state has open carry and concealed depending on the situation.
429,"yeah i think everyone should atleast know how to fire a gun ,sometimes unexpected things occur."
429,I agree 100 percent. It helps you not be as afraid in certain situations. We have several gun ranges close by. I need to go visit one.
429,well i dont usually go there but i have been there in the past.
429,I read a lot and see stories where a concealed gun holder helped save the day. 
429,i have experienced such situations so no doubt you are true.
429,When I was growing up we would go out to my grandparents property and shoot cans out in the middle of nowhere. It was fun and good practice.
429,"yeah thats really sounds fun , i wish i had a childhood like you."
429,"Good memories, for sure. I am sure you had just as exciting a childhood, just different activities."
429,yeah not so exciting though

430,I hope so too! Have you put together a portfolio to see if scholarships were available? 
430,"Yes I have, my best pieces are of New York city, I got a lot of inspiration from going there."
430,"I have never been, but New York city is on my bucket list! "
430,"It is very amazing, what else is on your bucket list?"
430,"I want to vist Hawaii, and Australia. I would love to see a Panda bear in the wild. What about you? "

432,"i dont trust online sites , they are often deceptive"
432,"They can be deceptive, which is why I stick to the stores that I have shopped in personally."
432,where do you usually shop?
432,"Stores like Macy's, JCPenney, Forever 21."
432,which ones are the cheapest?
432,You can always find sales at JCPenney especially around the holidays. I am tall and they have a better size selection online.
432,"i am tall too, i will definetly try that someday. "
432,They have big and tall stores but I am tall and skinny. Need to open a tall and skinny store.
432,thats funny but doesnt make any sense to be honest
432,People think if you are are tall you are big. Those close fall off of me or the pants come up my shins.

441,A bit of calisthenics. Mostly weight lifting though.
441,Nice. I originally did weights for my training but I want to incorporate more cardio.
441,Yeah I'm trying to get more into running. Get a little more leaner.
441,"I might set a goal to run a half-marathon. Just to prove people wrong, you know? People say that because I'm a short woman I can't do it."
441,Haha. Idk if height has anything to do with it. But giving your all is what counts.
442,It worked out! I just had to call and speak to customer service.
442,That's good! I recently had a bad run-in with customer service.
443,"I studied nonstop it seemed, but now that's over It really feels good."
443,Awesome! When will you know the results?
443,"Monday afternoon at the latest I was told, what have you been up too?"
443,Just hitting the clubs and enjoying what's left of the nice weather!
443,G
443,What are you going to do now that the test is over? Feel like going out?
443,"Was going to ask if you'd like to do something, I was thinking we could get outside, maybe do some hiking since the weather's still nice."
443,I'll be busy through the day for the next few weeks -- but I'm free every evening this week except for Tuesday
443,"That sounds even better, maybe go clubbing? what time Tuesday do you want to meet up?"
443,I can't Tuesday. Any evening but that one. How about Thursday? They're having a party at Stix
443,"OK, then Thursday it is. I'll meet you at Stix."
443,What time? Want to go eat at Fogo's before?
443,"say around 8pm? and Fogo's is good, seems like forever since I've been there."
444,I found the sets on Game of Thrones so convincing. Ever thought about stage design?
444,I really thought about being a interior designer do you think that is an easy field to get in
444,"I have no idea what it would take. I think you would find competition stiff in a large city, for sure."
444,I think being blonde in this field would be a plus well i sure do hope so
444,"Heh, heh. Beautiful hair and all is what we seek with our interior designers!"
444,I know right just saying would make life great as long as the boss stay in his lane and dont try coming on to me
444,"You could always commit to working with women bosses, although even this might prove a challenge these days."
444,you right women are so disrespectful to each other i just dont feel like an all women job would be in my best intrest
444,"I love working with women and interior design will surely place you alongside women, even in school."
444,Well if you think it would be a good fit I'm all in
444,"The best thing I know about the field is being able to use your creative mind, but yep, you will have to work with women all right."
444,Ok being blonde and being in a field with women may not be as bad as i think Im gain
445,Thank you! When the sun is out it is easy to have a good day! The other day I just curled up in a ball cuz of rain.
445,Aw man. You don't like the rain??
445,It was too cold! And then it got humid and penetrated my being. Usually I love it.
445,Ohhh. Yea I know what you mean.. I love to watch movies on a rainy day. Hbu?
445,I like to read on rainy days. I really like thunderstorms best. These I can't sit still for! I just watch for lightning.
445,What kind of books you read? Do you normally read for your past time?
445,"I like history, but nothing beats a good romance for passing the time. What do you watch on TV?"
445,Cool cool. Them romance novels will keep you warm ha. I usually play games. I don't watch TV much.
445,"Computer games, I take it? What kind?"
445,"Ha, yeah definitely. A game called Quake. I play it constantly. You play any games?"
445,Too addictive! I get stuck on bubble-shooter as it is. heh heh. My son liked Eve. Ever play that?
445,No. I'm pretty focused on Quake. Me and my friends even have a group to help us strategize. Haha.
445,That is how he played. He became an administrator for the game. That good. 
446,I definitely  don't have a career in politics! Did the Speech Communications class help?
446,it did . what did you study or do for work ?
446,I'm in medical school. Hoping to be a surgeon someday
446,What field of medicine are you studying?
446,"Cardiothoracic Surgery -- heart, lungs, that sort of thing."
446,i like going to school but i don't have steady hands so no surgery for me .
446,"Both of my parents are doctors. I grew up playing the game ""Operation"" if you've ever played that -- I was a champ!"
446,"Yes, but my parents were both clowns so it was really crazy when we got together to play games."
446,LOL! We need to introduce them! It wouldn't hurt my parents to lighten up a little bit!
446,They would make me take the train with them to work. People would look at us strange!
446,Hee hee hee... no wonder you were leery of public speaking!
446,I am afraid of clowns now. Still taking the train to work. Do you take the train?
447,"Habits maybe, I'm not truly sure myself. What should I have done?"
447,why what did you do ?
447,I was drunk and I was scared...
447,That is no excuse! You know how much I love my hot dogs. You took it and Lied about it.
447,I'm not talking about the hot-dog situation... I left them there. They were laying on the ground. I don't know if they were okay. 
447,Just come clean I know you did it. It is like a scene from my favorite horror novel. 
447,"I don't know if I'm ready to accept the consequences. It is not my first offense. I know it's my fault, but I'm so stressed out."
447,"Don't stress. I forgive you, but you need to buy me some more. "
447,Why? You're suppose to support me without wanting anything in return. 
447,You lie about taking my hot dog and you expect me to support you. This really is like my horror novel
447,Can't you move on? This is serious. My job is on the line. I didn't went to law school all these years for nothing. 
447,I do not even know what to say to you right now. 
448,Nice! How's the weather?
448,"Looks great for fishing off the boat, but I am stuck cutting hair."
448,"What a job! I hope you get plenty of time off. I haven't been very busy, just reading a lot."
448,I don't have time to read or fish. I never get to use the boat except for sleeping at night.
448,Wow. I know how to cut hair. Maybe I can take your place for a while and give you a break! The Pacific sounds nice right now
448,That would be great. Maybe I could learn to serf too. 
448,"I'm not a certified surf instructor, but you could use my board while I'm cutting hair LOL"
448,I will surf when the tide is low.
448,"Yes, start slowly. Do some internet research when you get a chance!"
448,Thanks! I plan to.
448,What's the best way to get there?
448,You should google it.
449,Yeah that's one of the reasons its a favorite trail of mines. 
449,"same, its quite cool"
449,I often use stock photos of it for some of the marketing campaigns I work on. I plan too visit very soon. Have you ever been?
449,Yes I have been. Me and my brother have red hair and people on the trail look at us strange.
449,Hahaha. Do you look back at them strange? People with red hair are awesome! They're just jealous that's all.
449,That makes me think of the janet jackson song I get lonely lol. They seme ok.
449,People like that make me want to scream. Like thar Michael and Janet Jackson song. Lol. 
449,I used to listen to George Michael and Atomic Kittens lol I was a teen when that song came out
449,George Michael is the guy who sings Careless Whisper right?
449,I always imagined taking over the world with him. just a crazy thought.  
449,Here's a thought: Appalachian Trail with a man and woman and the guy has bad breath and talks to her and the Careless Whisper sax plays.. Perfect mint gum commercial!
449,that sound amazing! Me and my brother look like twins! Maybe it could be a double mint gum commercial?
450,"I'm the same way, but honestly, hiking in the mountains is a lot of fun."
450,I didn't mean that. I just meant trying that new backpack as being untrustworthy compared to my old one.
450,"I don't like change, either. Maybe you could try the new backpack out, and keep your old one just in case."
450,"OK. You know, I would never get rid of my old one. How about you try the new one instead?"
450,I could do that. I have a hiking trip planned for next weekend. 
450,Super. Super. Where are you going?
450,To my vacation home in Pine Mountain Valley. It's near Fort Benning in Georgia. It's great hiking there!
450,Hmmm. I haven't been hiking in Georgia yet. My last hike was near Monte Cristo in Washington State. Whew!
450,"Was it a long hike, or just a lot of altitude? I've never been to Washington State, but it looks beautiful in pictures."
450,"Altitude, for sure. The hike is at least 7 miles. Yeah, it is beautiful. I would like to hike in Georgia sometime."
450,It's nice. Pine Mountain Valley is at the foothills of the Smokey Mountains. I can hike the Appalachian trail from there.
450,"Nothing like Western Washington Cascades, I bet?"
451,I study the Bible a lot
451,"So do I. I live in the big city, but I love getting out of town to go on a hike and read."
451,"Oh, me too! Every chance I get. I love nature."
451,I would love to move to a cabin in the woods and leave the city behind.
451,"It sounds nice. I wouldn't mind having a cabin for retreats, but I like being pretty close to civilization"
451,I would be fine on an off the grid homestead. I have had enough civilization to last a lifetime. 
451,"I get like that sometimes. I'm pretty big on creature comforts, though. Plus I have to sell jewelry to pay the bills"
451,What kind of jewelry do you make?
451,"Necklaces, bracelets, that sort of thing. I love using Swarovsk crystals"
451,Crystals are really pretty. 
451,I do like shiny things LOL. Does your work keep you pretty busy?
451,Absolutely! I work for Cherokee Nation in Indian child welfare. 
451,That's awesome! I admire that greatly!
451,Thanks. A lot of sad stories.
452,Canadians are getting on the map now.. Pun intended lol
452,"yes,your from canada"
452,No Australia. Kangaroo Jack and all that. 
452,Oh wow! I always thought kangaroos were really interesting animals!
452,Yeah.. They can pack a punch! But I can take it. Got 10 piercings after all
452,wow that is a lot of piercings! Any tattoos? 
452,Yes! Plenty! Haha!
452,I have one of a drum! I was the drummer in our high school band. Crazy dare turned true on my arm. 
452,That's kinda cool though! Never heard of a drum tat.. I recently got a tat of a no smoking sign. Celebrating 3 years of not smoking.
452,Good for you! I smoked for years and quit. The only thing I smoke now is meats on the grill. I hear there is great food down under.
452,"That's great! Yeah, WE'RE the great food here in Australia. Food for the critters!"
452,do you eat kangaroo ? crocodile ?
453,I am male. You?
453,"I'm a female, but when I talk about my hobby people just assume I'm not haha!"
453,What is your hobby?
453,Playing chess and making music. 
453,There are plenty of females that do that. I would probably enjoy them too if I could ever put down my Harry Potter books.
453,"Oh my god, I love Harry Potter too! Who is your favorite character?"
453,My favorite is Hagrid. I can relate to his connection to nature and animals. 
453,You must love Fantastic Beasts as well then?
453,"I do, however, I like the setting of Hogwarts better. "
453,"I can understand that, there's just this ambiance in Hogwarts that is impossible to replicate. "
453,Absolutely. Who is your favorite character?
453,"Hermione for sure, so witty and passionate!"
453,I like her too. 
453,I don't think anybody can dislike the golden trio haha
454,Are you Australian? 
454,not at  all
454,LOL! I was thinking of going to the under for some schooling.
454,i am from the USA
454,That is awesome! do you travel?
454,i do love to travel. been to some part of asia. Do you love to travel to
454,I really do! I like to hike and explore outdoors. I like the wilderness and animals. I always wanted to work with animals.
454,"Wow. that's sounds fun, we do a lot of hunting it is fun too. deer hunting season now looking forward for more hunting experience"
454,After my parents got divorced my dad took our hunting dog.  
454,"oh sorry about that, "
454,I miss him but thinking of getting another one
454,"yeah, i understand that hope you get new one pretty soon it's fun"
455,uuuuuu . . . oh yeah. My favorite was my old 86 mazda. Turbo was great.
455,"That's so cool. I love being on the wild side sometimes too, that's why I love swimming. Gives me a boost of energy every time"
455,Me too! I once swimmed in a lightning storm and felt the electricity through me. I got out then.
455," I had the same feeling when I had some tacos from Eddy's Locos Tacos the other day, as you can see i love tacos"
455,"Well, I am a pizza fan. Love the fresh tomatoes on Canadian bacon. Love it so much. "
455,Do you agree with pineapple on pizza? if you do we could honestly be best friends
455,Consider it done. I always order Hawaiian pizza on at least half of it. Wow.
455,Oh wow haha that's actually kinda same. Doesn't even have to be ham sometimes I do pineapple and pepperoni 
455,Ever substituted fried salami instead of bacon with the eggs?
455,Never BUT now that you say that it sounds like a great idea. What brand?
455,"Well, make sure it is thin sliced is all. Most brands have this incredible shelf life. Like two year from now."
455,"Oh well I'll look forward to buying some then. Maybe my local Publix has em, thanks for the tip!"
455,Sure!
455,Nice talking have a great nice!
455,You too!
456,"Yes! Not gonna lie though, it's a bit stressful. Especially the fact we had to move. "
456,"I can imagine it can be stressful, but all that is behind you now."
456,"You're right! It's time for celebration, which funny enough is the name of my new town haha! How's your job going?"
456,"It is going alright I guess. I love what I do, but it can be very stressful."
456,Understandable! What do you do when you're stressed out?
456,I love to spend time in nature.
456,Oh cool. Do you just relax or like go on hikes?
456,Both. I am a hunter so I spend a lot of time in nature. My family does not eat any store bought meat. 
456,Can you hunt all year round when you are? 
456,"There is almost always something in season, but most is in the fall or winter. I usually am able to keep our freezers full throughout the year."
456,"That's really cool! I wish I could do the same, but I can't get myself to push the trigger in front of an animal. "
456,Hunting is something passed down in my family. We are Cherokee and only hunt with traditional methods. 
456,I find it's honorable to continue traditions like that. 
457,Wow! Ten years is a long time to be prepared. I plan 3 years ahead.
457,"The Internet has made it a lot easier! I used to be a travel agent a long time ago, though. Lots of places I still need to see!"
457,"Yes, the Internet helps me research my travel and career options. Do your old job?"
457,It's much easier now. I'm always planning trips in my mind -- I'm planning every trip I'm going to take for the next five years
457,I am too forgetful. You must have a great memory. Do you miss your old travel agent job?
457,"Sometimes. It was fun planning trips for other people, and gave me good ideas about where I'd like to go. What destination do you dream about going to?"
457,"I really want to go to Novalja, Croatia. Next year, in 2020, they are hosting the Fresh Island rap festival."
457,How awesome! My father's family is from Croatia and I've always wantd to go there. That sounds amazing!
457,Really? That is awesome! I hope you do get to go. Do you still have family in Croatia?
457,"Yes, I only know them through Facebook, though. And I love Croatian rap! Fun to watch YouTube videos LOL"
457,That is really cool. I try to stay in touch with my family through Facebook. They are all in the UK.
457,That's one thing Facebook is good for. I've found family on several continents that I would have never known about otherwise. Do you miss the UK?
457,I wish I did miss the UK. I left it when I was 3. I hardly remember it. I want to visit it.
458,"Deer, mainly, The bigger the better. And you?"
458,mostly deer that is the most popular in my area
458,Deer are everywhere where the're nature. I take it you live close to a forest?
458,Yes! My boss works for the forest service. 
458,"Hmm, I guess that means you also work for the forest service, yeah? I'll bet it's a rewarding job, being so close to nature."
458,my girlfriend! She is my boss too lol
458,"Yeah, the best women are our bosses. So, you're studying at university, yeah? What are you studying?"
458,Im in school now for psychology. ITs so boring! I would rather sing
458,"Singing is fun, and can be quite cathartic. You should do a study to see how singing affects mood."
458,Definitely working on that.  Good idea! Do you go to school?
458,No. I'm too busy hunting deer and fishing.
458,Did you ever think of taking classes maybe or watching videos? Of deer?
459,It is all steak the name is determined from what part of the cow it comes from.
459,"I guess it make sense, yes. I like to eat my steak medium rare. How do you like yours cooked?"
459,I like medium well to well.
459,Some people would say that you like them overcooked haha! 
459,I have had many people tell me that. I just can't bring myself to eat it any less done. 
459,"I can understand, no judgment here! My mom used to cook them well done because she was afraid of food poisoning.  "
459,I am not sure of why. I eat duck medium.
459,Duck steak? So you agree that steak can be mean more than just cow meat? 
459,"It can be. I have deer steak in the freezer, but the duck is duck breast. "
459,Did you hunt the deer on your own or just store bought
459,I hunt them. My family does not buy meat from a store. 
459,That's pretty cool. You must save money then. 
460,"I've always been interested in criminal justice. My mother was a victim of violent crime once, and I've always wanted to be in law enforcement."
460,Sorry to hear about your mother. Good for you! Better job than mine working at Target
460,Target's a great store. I'm glad I've got one so close to home. How long have you worked there?
460,Just started 3 days ago! I get a discount on dog biscuits. I buy my dog one after work every day. But i have a secret! 
460,Oh yeah? What's that? You tell me yours and I'll tell you mine
460,The dog treats! I cant help
460,LOL! Some of them do look tempting. My secret: I'm afraid of the dark. I hope they don't figure that out at the police academy!
460,hahahahah. We have that in common! 
460,I'll have to give the dog treat thing a try!
460,I can only eat them in the dark! lol
460,LOLOL! That's the funniest thing I've heard all day! I'll have to tell my mom that one. She's really my best friend
460,"My dog is not quite my best friend, but she sure does cheer me up a ton!"
461,"I don't have kids, unfortunately - boating accident."
461,So sorry to hear. They are laying in green pastures sure...
461,That's sad. So have you seen 16 candles?
461,I have seen every single one! All sad. All green! I think green is my favorite color. What is yours?
461,"Grey is probably my favourite colour, but I like blue. What's you're favourite one?"
461,Blue is nice. What kind of music do you like?
461,"I like rock and rap mainly, though I enjoy a bit of synth pop music as well. Prefer films though. What about you?"
461,ROCK! I like rock and roll. BINGO
462,"I'd love to be able to play banjo, but I can only play the guitar"
462,"It's basically the same, just have to memorize new chords, and practice finger picking. "
462,"Yeah, the only problem is that banjos cost a fortune. Are you in a band?"
462,"Oh I get you, they definitely are expensive instruments. I was in a band before yes!"
462,"I'd have loved to be in a band, but life takes over. I'm more into fitness and running these days, you?"
462,Interest and passions seems to change with time. That's amazing that you're into fitness. Music is my favorite hobby. 
462,Yeah. Who's your absolute favourite?
462,It is hard to pick one. My favorite artist right now is K flay. Do you know her?
462,No but I think I'll Google her for a listen. I'm quite fond of female vocalists. Do you recommend any others?
462,"I'm glad. Oh the list could go on forever. Florence and the machine, Haim, Courage my love, Sainte."
462,I wish I still enjoyed music like I used to. I don't find the same joy from it that I once did.
462,"That's difficult to deal with sometimes I find, when we lose interest. Do you used to go to concerts?"
463,It takes a true poet to write that down
463,"Some thoughts you just have to capture before they're gone, right?  "
463,i agree completely.  
463,"Do you like rock music? Metallica, ACDC, or Nirvana? "
463,I live in Seattle and have seen most of those groups live! I was born a giant 
463,"Awh man! That's incredible, who among those you saw was your favorite?"
463,Nirvana! Good thing I am tall! My parents were over 6 ft. i could see over the other peoples heads. Do you like them?
463,"I think they are great. They are in strong rotation on my playlist. I'm a cab driver, so my customers get to know good music. RIP Cobain"
463,"cab driver? i hope that you are not driving now lol. i am a angry democrat,you/?"
463,"Shh, don't tell! Is angry democrat your profession or hobby? I just plain and simple don't trust the govt."
463,Its all a conspiracy my friend. Listen to the late ones. The truth is hidden in never mind.  
463,The late ones? The truth is hidden? Where?! I NEED to know.
464,Who is your favourite author?
464,My favourite author is Robin Hobb. She writes epic fantasy with wonderful characters. What about you?
464,Dan Parkinson has some excellent novels.  I really like the Dragonlance series.  
464,I've heard of that series but haven't read it. What did you like about it?
464,"I like that it takes place in a world with endless possibilities, the author makes you feel like you're there!"
464,"That's the main draw with fantasy for me. The sheer scope makes anything possible, and with a good writer, you're immersed. "
464,Do you read anything by George RR Martin?
464,"Yeah, I've read his Song of Ice and Fire. He's probably my second or third favourite author. I take it you're also a fan?"
464,I am definitely!  And the t.v. adaptation was great... until the way the writers ended it.  What did you think?
464,I think the two creators are terrible writers and I have no idea how they managed to blag their way through the first 5 seasons.
464,"I enjoyed most of the series, but the way they wrapped it up so fast was a disservice to the story."
464,Yeah. They had one eye on Star Wars and just wanted GoT over. I read last week that Star Wars dropped them! 
464,I am glad!  Serves them right!
465,I believe they do too.  Life without it would be boring.  What do you think?
465,"I don't know. I believe we only get one life, and I'd rather spend my time enjoying life rather than working it away."
465,As would I.  I think there is too much focus on material objects and having nice 'things'.  
465,I suppose there has to be a balance of both. To enjoy solitude and the company of others.
466,WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
466,"Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, that's a long name"
466,sure it is! why are you hiding from madonna?
466,Because of the person she is.  She hates Taco Bell...  my husband is the CEO.
466,she may hate taco bell but still she may like your husband\
466,she might . she thinks she is better than me because she has an actual job .
466,you got a job too i think.. don't you?
466,No I don't. I am retired. I used to work in Journalism. I relax on the beach now.
466,well you still write as a hobby i can say
466,yes . i love to read and write . it keeps me inspired .
466,what else do you do on your free time?? 
466,I just watch musical tv series Glee :)
466,really? seems interesting
466,"yeah , its kind of over the top sometimes haha but interesting"
466,what's your favorite one?
466,"probably katt williams live , but they're all funny"
467,i dont wont to have to go trow that. scars me
467,"It is very scary, but we cannot avoid death."
467,thats true. i just hope its a long time from now.
467,"oh yeah, I feel the same. Honestly, Its hard to drive a car without fearing an accident. "
467,true. i just try not to think about it. just go n come back.
467,"I have tried that too, but I have an issue staying under the speed limit. "
467,me to. im luckey i have not got a speeding ticket yet.
467,I have never gotten a speeding ticket either lol
467,cool. i got stoped 1 time got off rith a warning. and i can get road rage! lol
467,I get horrible road rage!! It seems people are becoming worse drivers. 
467,yes. here thay dont know what a blinker is. and thay have truble finding the gas peddel.lol
467,"people who do not use their blinkers or text and drive, drive me crazy!!"
467,im gonna get a bumper sticker that say.  get off the cell phone n drive..
468,He is great! I like him too. What about Tim Cook?
468,The current CEO? Would you say he's quite the genius that Jobs was?
468,Noting like Jobs but i think he can sail Apple the way they are now. It is not bad
468,"Yeah he inherited some pretty big shoes, but he is doing a great job so far.  Have you heard that Apple is developing a car?"
468,The Project Titan? Must be sweet.
468,"I didn't know it had a name, is that the official name for the car right now?"
468,I don't know. I just heard it from the news or something.
468,"Interesting, what do you think about Tesla, will they be a competitor with Apple?"
468,For me I think Telsa is already at the top and Apple need to do a lot of catch up. 
468,Agreed. Tesla is currently doing a great job with their enhanced autopilot.
468,I wish their Semi-truck will help a lot.
468,I'm interested to see how safe and fast that thing will be...pretty exciting.
469,Those are all really great songs that I'm familiar with.
469,I would really like to see her in concert some day!
469,"Me too, she is good, and she definitely helped careers for newer female artists"
469,She sure did!  Her dance moves and her voice brought a lot of attention...such an iconic and timeless artist!
469,I have always wondered about her name and if it is a reference to Lady Madonna.
469,"It would be a very good question to ask her, I would sure love a chance to interview her!"
469,"Did you know she is the same age as ""Weird Al"" Yankovic?"
469,"Yes, I did, and I am a fan of ""Weird Al"" as well...but did you know that Madonna is also a successful actress?"
469,I had no idea.  What movies has she starred in?
469,"One of my favorites was ""Desperately Seeking Susan.""  She has so much talent!"
469,"I doubt she'll be able to dance like that for very much longer, but I'll always love her music!"
469,That's the nice thing about her having music videos...her skills are recorded for all time.
470,I love cokes!
470,Me too! I love them.
470,i start my day with one
470,That's cool. I buy the box of six and don't share with anyone
470,LOL! i wouldn't either
470,Have you ever tried Jones Soda? They have some awesome flavors! the cream soda one is my fav
470,Never heard of it. Those cream sodas are yummy
470,yeah but my very favourite is mountain dew!!!!! i drink one every single day while I am in chess club
470,I don't know why people love that moutain dew! A lot of people I meet love them too
470,yeah i just think it is very refreshing and they have many flavours
470,i haven't tried it in awhile - like years - maybe i should try it again
470,"i would if i were you, im sure they have revised the formula since and you could try a new flavour"
470,do you remember Jolt Cola?
471,OH NO!! do they have security cameras at work?
471,they might. My dad used to work at home depot and they had cameras there that they watched every night as they closed up
471,"ya, they have those cameras that make a noise when you walk by them"
471,"you know what i wish it played, country music"
471,really? i don't care much for it - i like the old school rock n roll
471,well then you aren't listening to the right artists!! if you go into it with an open mind i am sure you will find songs you fall in love with
471,i used to work in a country dance hall. it wasn't to bad
471,wow that sounds like alot of fun. what were the job requirements??
471,"i was working as a server for the bar, so not to many requirements needed"
471,oh yeah i was a server this summer 
471,it can be a lot of fun! all the dancing around and stuff
471,i agree i love that stuff
472,you sound like your busy
472,"yeah i am, here in the united states there are such high expectations and i feel pressured to succeed "
472,that's gotta be hard - since your in school too - can't let it get to you
472,yeah i try not too. being in school is like a full time job honestly and hockey ontop of that is overwhelming
472,school is a full time job! but when you graduate you will feel so less pressured for sure
472,i agree. do you have any experience with the pressures of school or work??
472,"both! i went to college awhile back and work a full time job, but, i was able to get through it"
472,what did you study?
472,"computer science, to build websites and stuff"
472,"oh wow, i had a first year class in that and it was really interesting but I am sure it gets very hard"
472,"i don't even use my degree, waste of $$"
472,"uh oh, sometimes i worry that will happen to me"
473,wow i really like kayaking that is an interesting fact
473,"i started kayaking about 3 years ago, but stopped after I tumped over and couldn't get back on it"
473,"oh wow yeah i would be afraid, sometimes you do not know what is under the water, like crabs"
473,we have seen alligators in the waters that I turned over in. it was very scary. i haven't been back on it 
473,yeah i would not be too interested in falling into water like that
473,"right! i live in an apartment, asked the office people if i could take my kayak to the pool, late at night to i could practice recoery"
473,what did they say
473,"they said no! but, if i would have done it late at night, they probably wouldn't have known. i'm totally scared to go back in the water"
473,yeah they totally wouldnt know who goes to the pool at night 
473,"i totally loved it - being on the water, i do love the water"
473,i love the water too it is so calming
473,"yes it is!! just floating around, so relaxing. i used to go after work"
474,If you eat meat then you are hurting the enviroment.
474,I would be less satisfied without meat but I could eat less ofi t
474,Have you ever just thought about eating a fresh non meat pizza at a flower shop? That would be nice.
474,"I haven't. I typically eat pizza at a pizza shop. I prefer meat pizza, but I like cheese pizza as well. How long have you not eaten meat?"
474," I never really ate pizza with meat on it. Since my favorite chicken died in front of my eyes for food, I been off meat forever. "
474,Wow! Someone ate your favorite chicken? That's rough. Did you know it was going to be raised for food before it became your favorite chicken?
474,No. I never knew any animal was raised for food. I used to think that all meat was from plants. My parents lied to me.
474,"What did you think happened to the animals? So, you ate meat, but you though it came from plants? How long did you believe this?"
474,I believed it until the day my chicken waas murdered at the local flower shop..
474,So why would you want to eat pizza a the flower shop were your chicken was killed? You said it would be nice. That seems odd.
474,It's to prove to my chicken that I will never eat meat again.
474,Do you think the chicken would even know? It's dead. Why not just eat your pizza at a pizza shop?
475,It pepperoni my favorite! Whats your favorite?
475,My favorite is meat lover's Chicago style!
475,Yea meat lover's pizza is good as well but its a bit to heavy for me. How many slices can you usually eat?
475,OF Chicago style meat lover's? Only one but I enjoy every cheesy bite! How about you? How many can you eat?
476,Do you do them in pen or pencil? That's the true test of a crossword puzzle lover.
476,I'm an experienced crossword player so I like to do them in pen! How about you?
476,"Same here, but it took me years before I was confident enough to do so. My girlfriend finally talked me into just trying it. I always use pen now."
476,That really good. Though I still do make mistakes every now and then. How often do you do crossword puzzles throughout the week?
476,Daily. I like to do the New York Times crossword every day. I also have a book of crossword puzzles that I do when I'm bored.
476,Impressive! I do like doing crossword puzzles with pen and paper but I find it easier now to do them on my phone or tablet.
476,They are okay on the phone but it just doesn't feel the same as the ones on paper. It's like an e-reader vs a book. Which do you prefer?
476,I feel like its just more convenient when I read books on an e-reader rather then a book so I would prefer e-reader if I'm on the go! 
476,"I think it just depends. I prefer a book. I like the feel, the smell, having it in my hands. When I travel I bring the e-reader."
476,I agree! I do prefer books when I'm at home the smell of a good book would definitely make you keep want to reading.  
476,Totally! I always feel weird saying that to people. Not everyone understands. How often do you read? I go through at least a book a week.
476,usually once a month . how has your weekend been ?
476,It's been pretty good. I read a book and I ran. How about you? 
477,I'm just listening to some music helps the time go by faster.
477,I usually turn on the tv while I clean. It help make it go by faster for me too. I like watching scooby doo. Do you watch tv? 
477,I don't watch tv much anymore. Most of things I watch are via the internet now like netflix and youtube.
477,I still consider that tv. I might watch it on my computer but it essentially the same. I don't have cable is all.
477,I disagree watching things via the internet goes beyond whats on the tv i feel like its more of a community people sharing their lives.
477,"Sure, if you are watching people's videos on youtube. But I mean netflix, hulu, amazon prime. Those are just tv on the internet. What shows do you watch on netflix?"
477,I'm watching black summer. Its a tv show about the zombie pandemic how about you? 
477,I'm watching Black Mirror. No zombies but random stories about how this technology age effects the world. Do you marathon watch or episode here and there?
477,Yes I have seen Black Mirror before. If the should is good enough I like watching them all in one go. 
477,"Wow...watching that much ""tv"" is too much for me. I could maybe do 2 episodes at a time...maybe. What do for hobbies? I like to draw comic book scenes."
477,I hate having to wait to find out what happened after a good episode so I have to watch the next episode. I like go to the gym.
477,cardio or weights?
478,Nice! Have you ever been to a working farm? It not what people think. How often do volunteer?
478,I havent been to a working farm before but i;d like to. i volunteer a few times a year
478,"Just out of curiosity, when I say I operate a family farm, what kind of farm do you think I mean? "
478,I think just a family owned farm where you harvest to eat or sell
478,I run a goat dairy.We work the farmer's market and we are in local grocery stores. What do you do?
478,I am a teacher and i enjoy travelling
478,That's great! I've never flown before. I like to keep my feet on the ground. What do you teach and what grade?
478,I teach math at grades 4 and 5. Do you enjoy music? cos i do
478,of course! You can't trust a person who doesn't like music. I like a lot of different genres. What do you like to listen to.
478,"I listen to absolutely anything, as long as it sounds good to me. I love blues though"
478,Who is your favorite artist or band? 
478,coldplay
479,I put him in time out to let him think about what he did.
479,You are doing the right thing for him to learn discipline.
479,"Maybe it was all the sugar, but he couldn't stay still for the duration of his punishment."
479,How did your son get so much sugar in his system? 
479,I think it must be from all the sugary drinks he got from the neighbor kid's house.
479,Maybe you should ban him from having any sugary drinks as punishment. It might make him more healthy as well. 
479,"That's a good idea, I will need to talk with the neighbor about this to ensure he sticks to it."
479,How long have you known your neighbor for? I'm a bit worried that your son can just get sugary drinks from them. 
479,"A little bit of time, but our kids get a long better than we do."
479,How often do you kids visit your neighbor?
479,"Every day after school it seems, but sometimes they visit on the weekends as well."
479,WOW that often. Do you know what they do when there over there? \
480,I enjoy honey and i feel like pooh the bear lol
480,"I like some honey, but not all honey is created equal. I do like a good hot toddy though. Ever had one?"
480,Nope
480,Do you drink alcohol? 
480,Yes i do especially at the beach side lol. I would like to live there someday
480,I'm the opposite. I would like to live mountains or near the mountains. If I can live near the mountains and the beach that would be fantastic!
480,Still great. I just love how the ocean makes me feel and waking up every morning to it will be bliss. What do you do?
480,I'm a photographer. You?
480,I am a teacher
480,Do you teach little kids or teenagers?
480,"Liitle kid, grades 4 and 5, it could be very stressful but we get along and i love them."
480,It takes a special person to be a teacher. I couldn't do it. Kudos. How long have you taught?
481,"That's interesting, I am a judge right now."
481,"No i dont, i am an artist and my drawings bring me lots of money"
481,"Very nice, we need more artists in the world, how long have you been drawing?]"
481,so about 6 years or more
481,"I'm on the circuit court, but I'm about to find out what article III of the constitution is all about."
481,Law seems difficult it seems..
481,"Very difficult, but mostly memorization and there's always reference materials."
481,"Hope you watch movies to keep you sane lol, i enjoy movies, kinda takes the stress of the day off for me"
481,"Definitely, I watch tv mostly, but catch some movies on the weekends if i have time."
481,I hear you :) I do the same
481,"Hopefully not too much Law and Order, that show isn't accurate!"
481,"no not at all its a fantasy show, law certainly doesnt work that way"
482,I had to excuse myself professionally before I said something that could cause trouble.
482,Wow. I don't know if I would have been able to do that. I work at a cinema...people are rude to me all the time.
482,"I am sorry to hear that, people that are rude to employees are the worst."
482,I agree. I never understand why they do that. I got popcorn thrown at me once. I don't even like popcorn!
482,"Oh that just sounds awful, I am surprised you haven't quit that job yet."
482,"It's in the works, believe me. This is just my job while I'm in school. I have a semester left! What do you do?"
482,"I have been working in retail while I finish up school, same as you I suppose."
482,What are you studying?
482,I am just going for an associate's degree for the time being. You?
482,I'm studying engineering.
482,"Oh, that's quite admirable! What do you want to do with your degree?"
482,I want to work with plastics. Find/create a more environmentally safe option. What kind of associates degree are you working towards?
483,They did not anyways thats fine because in 2 months i will leave here for San Diego

483,oh very nice who was your mother if i may ask?
483,"Mrs Andrews May. you can look her up,theres a few article about her on the internet."
483,I just recently learned she was American
483,Yeah she was but my dad English. They met in the dance school in London
483,"i bet they are really nice, everything she wears is super cute"
483,I know right? Super excited about moving to san diego. what do you do?
483,i follow a metal band so i am a groupie meaning i just follow them and thats about it lol kinda boring
484,yeah what shops do u want to go to
484,"I think we should probably go to the mall, is that okay?"
484,yeah thats cool any shop imparticular
484,How about Hot topic? or Maybe Fast Forward?
484,i was thinking old navy or nike
484,"Nike sounds good, I need some new converse anyway"
484,haha sorted what should we do for lunch then
484,cinnabon? just a giant cinnabon for lunch?
484,yeah sounds good to me
484,"awesome, i'll get one to go, too. mmmm cinnabon!"
484,i fancy a starbucks

485,precious and princess
485,"Lovely names, I don't have kids myself as I'm focusing on my career"
485,Okay thats awesome. are you married?
486,"That's a good film, I'm quite lazy so I love sitting at home and watching films"
486,I have to watch a horror film with my husband.  I am scary.
486,I prefer to watch horror films alone
486,What is your latest horror movie?  I have not watched any lately.
486,I enjoyed the film It Follows. What other things do you like? I enjoy fast food
486,"I am actually trying to stay away from fast foods, but ChicFilA is my weakness."
486,"I have never had ChicFilA, is it nice?"
486,It is very good. You should give it a try.
486,"I will try it soon, my favourite fast food is probably just McDonalds"
486,I really like McDonald's french fries. 
486,"The french fries are lovely, and I love Big Macs too"
486,You make me want to try a Big Mac!
487,Tell me a little bit more about why you feel this way? Was there something that happened recently?
487,"Indeed, I got the bad news of my husband doing something behind my back. He met up with another woman!"
487,"Oh wow, that is not good. What a a jerk! How did you find out?"
487,"It's ironic because one of my grand children told me during our family dinner. She was like ""Pops met up with a lady yesterday. They were holding hands!"""
487,Oh my did you confront your husband about this? I would be soooo mad!
487,"Why yes, I did! The moment he came home from work, I just had to confront him right then n' there."
487,"That must have taken some courage- and what did ""mr. innoncent"" have to say for himself? I would have been going into a clinical depression."
487,He kept on playing dumb and acted as if he had no idea what I was rambling on about. I guess you could neither of us slept well that night.
487,of course he did! What do you see as you next step here?
487,"I don't want to be a drama queen, but I'd thought of bringing the two of us to a relationship counselor. See if we could work something out."
487,That seems ilke a good idea- if only you can get the creep to go.
487,"I guess, but for now I'm still trying to figure out what happens next! I'm just very heartbroken by all of this."
488,I do not like the fact she gets drunk so often.
488,"She shouldn't drink so much, have you told her that she gets drunk too often?"
488,I have and she is the sweetest when sober.  She calls it having a good time with her friends.
488,That's a shame. I don't have any friends to have a good time with as I've just moved to a new area
488,"Oh really, what area did you move?"
488,I have moved to PA from VA and I'm not very happy about it
488,Was it a sudden or planned move? I am in TN.
488,It was quite a sudden move. I don't like the winters here because I have fibromyalgia
488,"Oh, I understand.  Maybe you will adjust and start enjoying your new area."
488,"I hope so, how do you like where you live?"
488,"I have TN -  it is growing, the weather is not and I love how friendly the people are in TN."
488,"I have a cousin who lives in TN, I would like to visit some day"
488,Definitely worth a visit.
489,She likes to spend more time talking to her friends on facebook than spending time with me.
489,"Wow, I'm sorry to hear that! I could understand why that may bother you so much."
489,"Yes, sometimes I feel as though she doesn't value her relationship with me as much as she does with her online friends."
489,"Yeah, forget about her. If it makes you feel better, you can come to my house and I'll cook for you!"
489,"LoL. As tempting as that may be, I could not do that to her. We have been together three years already and I do love her."
489,"Yeah, sure. But come on... think about it, she obviously doesn't like you as much as you think."
489,Maybe. Or does she feel neglected because I work such long hours as a nurse?
489,It's a possibility. Or maybe she's secretly talking to another guy?
489,"Well, she does have that one guy friend that she seems pretty chatty with. It does make me wonder."
489,"Yeah, you should probably look into that more. She sounds shady."
489,So are you suggesting that I should come right out and ask her? Or should I look at her phone when she is out of the room?
489,"I know it sounds bad, but maybe snoop through her phone while she's asleep or something."
490,"I enjoyed my last game at the YMCA, where do you play?"
490,I usually play at our local park. I have a group of friends I meet up with on Friday afternoons.
490,"That seems like fun to play outdoors, do you play indoors if it rains or snows?"
490,"LoL. Well, we have been known to play in my garage if all else fails. I don't use the garage for my car, so it's perfect!"
490,Sounds fun! I really want to enter a tournament some day!
490,That would be fun. I'm a competitive person so that sounds like something I would enjoy!
490,"You should start playing competitively, and go for the Gold in the Olympics games!"
490,Have you ever played in a tournament and won?
490,"Not yet, I'm going to sign up for my first one soon!"
490,Does your YMCA offer tournaments there?
490,Badminto isn't very popular here therefore I have to go to another location. They really like to play raquetball here by the beach!
490,Raquetball by the beach? I can only imagine how that's possible?! LOL
490,It's fun!!!! You should try it sometime! Good luck and have fun!
491,Yes! Live bugs from the jungle.
491,Oh whoa the jungle? That's pretty wild
491,Yeah of course. Do you want to catch bugs with me sometimes?
491,"Sure, I don't have a problem with that"
491,It's gonna be very fun!
491,"It sounds like it is, what do you use to catch them?"
491,I use nets and containers.
491,What kind of bugs have you caught?
491,"I've caught spiders, worms, and grasshoppers! Boy are they fun to catch!"
491,Worms? Yuck!
491,I'm gonna put a worm on your shoulder the next time I see you at work.
491,Eww! That would be gross
492,"Only a little, I travelled about a lot so I didn't get much of a chance to learn"
492,What do you miss the most about Montreal?
492,"The people, definitely.  Everyone I met was so lovely.  Have you been?"
492,No. I have always wanted to go. I have only been inside of Canada once and that was at Niagra Falls.
492,"Niagara Falls is lovely!! If you could go anywhere, where would you go?"
492,"I have wanted to visit Germany. However, I also dream of going to Hawaii one day as well. How about you?"
492,"My family lived in Germany for a bit (military brat) and I'd definitely say go!  It's such a beautiful country.  I've always wanted to visit Ireland, myself"
492,I can imagine Ireland would be beautiful also. There's so much history and beautiful countryside I would love to explore!
492,And the culture!  Have you heard of the matchmaking festival?
492,I haven't. What is it?
492,"It's a festival in Lisdoonevarna, all of the local farmers used to venture into towns to find a wife - now it's a big matchmaking and ale festival!"
492,LoL that sounds like a blast! I will have to look that up!
493,"Oh wow, you sound very smart!"
493,Thank you! I studied history at school. Do you enjoy learning about history?
493,"Yeah, sometimes. But it must be interesting or else I'll get bored!"
493,"I agree, some history can be boring. They're more interesting if it's a romantic story"
493,"Indeed. When I hear about romantic stories, it touches my heart, y'know? The feels."
493,I like to live in the moment. Do you like intimacy?
493,"Oh, definitely! I need a man in my life who wants to be as intimate as I."
493,I think the supply of gentlemen these days are dwindling. 
493,"Sadly, that's true. If only I ran into more decent men."
493,"They do exist, trust me. "
493,"If you know some, introduce those men for me, please! The more men, the merrier."
493,"Hi, nice to meet you. Haha!"
494,"Ah, their pet was in need of vet bills.  It wasn't smart but it was worth it haha"
494,I hope their pet is okay? Have you heard any updates yet?
494,"Yeah, they're all good, they just ate some lego ad had to have surgery to get it out.  Dogs, eh?"
494,Well that's one way to get it out. Poor doggy!
494,I know!! I don't know what I'd do if anything happened to my babies!  Have you got any yourself?
494,"Yes, I have a small breed dog. She's my little shadow and follows me wherever I go. "
494,"Oh that's precious! I have a large breed male and a small breed female, they're so sweet together. What's her name?"
494,Izabella. We call her Bella for short. She's my rescue pup from the shelter.
494,Oh that's such a cute name.  Do you know what breed she is?  It can be hard with shelter dogs sometimes
494,"They thought chihuahua, however, it turns out she's a rat terrier mix. She's the sweetest girl, albeit a little klutzy at times, LOL."
494,A rat terrier?  Oh those are some zoomy babies!  Is she a bit of a wild one?
494,Not at all. She's mostly calm. She'll get one good burst of energy sometimes and just run and chase her ball.
495,I am pursuing a Bachelors in Legal studies
495,Oh that's cool. Where do you study?
495,Strayer 
495,That sounds nice. I am studying a masters in psychology
495,Oh that's cool. I am not at that stage yet lol. Do you like cars?
495,Yes but I wouldn't say I'm a car person. I like food and cooking though. Do you?
495,I enjoy cooking. I always like to create new recipes. I have a ford mustang and just made a car cake after it
495,Wow! Do you like baking cakes then?
495,Yeah I am a baker 
495,I like cinnamon rolls. Do you make them? 
495,I have not made them homemade yet but I am looking into it
495,"Try them sometime. There are recipes on the internet, you'll love them! My favourite dishes to make are lasagna and a special stir fried noodles with vegetables"
496,"I've never been to Hawaii, have you seen the beaches there? They are beautiful."
496,"No, I've never been there either.  I would love to go, though!"
496,"Same here, I've only ever seen it in pictures."
497,I guess so. That way I can get more things done in the day. Do you have a teenager?
497,Yes and sometimes it can be so difficult!
497,I agree. My teenager has not once asked me if I needed any help with household chores. Does your teenager help you out around the house?
497,"Well, only with prodding. I've had to negotiate a lot to get them to do much of anything, but it's gotten better this last year."
497,"That's good to hear. Maybe your teenager can encourage mine to help out, haha! Do you drive your teenager to school?"
497,"My teen just got his license this summer, so we let him drive the old Ford to give him some experience and independence."
497,Oh I see. That's nice. Mine hasn't got her license yet so I still drive her to school in my Prius.
497,"He just seems to forget to change the radio station back to my country music. I guess hip-hop is more his style, LOL>"

498,"He's old, he just wants to sleep, doesn't matter where haha"
498,Oh no! That could be the worst. What is your favorite activity to do with him?
498,"Well, when he's awake we go play frisbee, but his old legs don't carry him far now so mainly we just chill - he likes horror movies!"

500,I love Super Mario.
500,"Same here! I'm super anxious, so playing newer mario games with my kids really throws me back"
500,I heard there were over 500 million Mario video games sold.  I guess we werent the only ones that like it.
500,Really?  That's crazy!  That's like finding out that lego sells 75 billion Lego bricks each year
501,"The last time I was there I didn't have time to finish the Louvre Museum, and yes I do believe I ordered french fries last time."
501,oh ok i have never herd of the louvre museum

502,Because of all the Russian collusion in the elections... It's scary how much happens that we don't know about
502,I am more interested in the collusion with Ukraine.
502,I haven't heard about that one?
502,I love following politics but sometimes it is hard to know what to believe. 
502,Or who to believe... It's just a massive game of he-said-she-said
502,It really feels like we are apart of a fake world with all the fake news.
502,What's your favourite conspiracy theory?
502,I try to avoid conspiracy theories.
502,"As a writer, I love them.  They can be so mind blowing.  Why do you avoid them?"
502,Many of them are manufactured to harm the other side and do not follow facts.
502,How so?
502,"With Trumps Russian collusion the investigation report has come out saying no collusion, but people still believe it. "
503,Well I guess we have to take the colors the way they are given us.
503,That's true we have to take the colors that are given to us lol
503,Miami is so expensive now.  I make close to a million dollars a year but I don't kow if I'll be able to send my 3 kids there.
503,Yeah it's ridiculous how much it is to live in Miami. Do you ever wonder if you have any royalty in your family?
503,It is insane how expensive.  Not really. I already know I am a royal pain.  :-)
503,Lol my mom always joked with me and said that I am related to the Queen of England and I am next in line for the throne. 
503,Must have been waiting for the facilities.  Many people in your family?
503,I have a lot of family so we have to be thrifty on spending.  
503,Yeah that can be tough when things are tight.  I am so lucky I have a great job.
503,"Well right now I am more of stay at home mom but, my husband is the head of Taco bell so we survive"
503,It is great you can be with your kids all the time.  I wish I could spend more time with my 3.
503,"Yeah i used to work all the time so I never saw my son but, now my husband provides"
503,My wife is so great. She stays home as well.
504,They're not but that doesn't mean they don't.
504,"Exactly, especially where a call would be impolite or inappropriate, like calling very late at night."
504,They always interrupt family time. I do not answer the phone any more if i don't recognize the number.
504,"That's very fair, thank god for caller ID. Should be ending soon and you can go back to your normal life without those pesky calls."
504,I hope so.
504,Unknown calls make me anxious.
504,Same Here. I am glad my phone now tells me if a call is potential spam.
504,Exactly!  It's a shame email spam filters aren't as advanced.
504,I agree. I think I have 100 spam emails to every 1 legitimate email.
504,Even automatic spam applications don't do the job right.
504,I think they are getting better. 
504,"They are, but so are spammers... It should be prohibited honestly, they're mainly scams"
505,"Honestly, I mainly prefer meat - have you heard of the paleo diet?"
505,Yes I have heard of it vaguely
505,"You eat like people did in palaeolithic times.  Get back to humanity's roots of eating meat and veg an exercising, instead of like... McDonalds"
505,True lol. I try to eat healthy but I also include meat as well. My small beagle named Droopy likes to snitch my food.
505,"Meat is really good for you, to be fair! Droopy is the perfect name for a Beagle!"
505,My son wanted to name him snoopy but he has a droopy eye so it kind of sticks lol
505,Droopy snoopy! Absolutely perfect.  How old is your son?
505,He is a teenager lol. Do you have any kids
505,"None myself, but I have loads of nieces and nephews"
505,Awwww I bet you spoil them. Do you like to watch videos on Youtube? I did not like it at first but now I enjoy watching with my son
505,Youtube can be a great resource for learning!  You just have to be careful with young kids on it
505,Yes you do I have a young daughter as well so I have to be careful with what she watches
505,It's full of not very nice people... But you seem like a really responsible parent
505,Yes I always monitor what my children are watching
506,I also enjoy South Park.
506,The writers wrote a very funny musical too
506,Are you talking about Band in China?
506,"No haha, I mean The Book of Mormon.  What's Band in China?"
506,"Band in China is one of their newer episodes, like a few weeks old. It has to do with the goings on of China right now."
506,"Oh!  I've not been keeping up with the latest series, I don't like waiting for episodes so I'm going to binge when the series ends.  Is it good?"
506,I also haven't been keeping up with the new series. I have just heard about the new episodes from Reddit.
506,"Oh, good things or bad things? Haha"
506,"For South Park I would say bad, the Band in China literally got them banned in China. The episodes themselves seem pretty good."
506,"I mean, it sounds like the goal was to get banned in china... besides, it isn't hard LOL"
506,I think it was an unintentional goal.
506,Even winnie the pooh and dr who are banned in china haha
507,She's not a bad person. She's just incredibly irresponsible.
507,That is not the greatest for the kids.  Hopefully they will be ok.
508,"Green, it's so natural and woody"
508,Green is a great color! When I go on runs I love to look at all the greenery in the trees and plants. 
508,I love working out!! What's your favourite way of exercising? Running?
508,"Yes, running is my favorite exercise. I actually won a lot of trophies from track when I was a kid. What are your favorite workouts?"
508,"Oh really?  Track or field?  I'm more of a gym rat, I like the variety"
508,"Mostly just track since its all running. And I see, so do you like weight lifting, high intensity, cardio?"
508,"All of the above HIIT was great when I was working, but now I'm freelance I can do whatever"
508,I've never been a fan of HIIT because it drains me too quickly. What do you freelance?
508,"it's good for getting a lot in quickly, but it can be super draining. I'm a writer, you?"
508,"That's very true. I'm a student aid. So, what type of writing do you do?"
508,"Oh wow, how old are the kids you work with? True crime"
508,I work with different age groups since I work at both primary and high schools. And what exactly is true crime?
509,"I mean, treat others as you would want to be treated, right?"
509,Yes but not the traffic lights.Especially if you are in a foreign country.
509,Yeah got to be real careful not to mess up when you're driving on the opposite side of the road from what you are used to.
510,Next week.  I like summer better but I got vacation in fall so there it is.
510,I enjoy going into the mountains and looking at the leaves in the fall
510,"Yes, that is the best thing about autumn.  When the leaves change."
510,I also enjoy camping in the mountains its so cool
510,I love camping almost anywhere unless there is a lot of bugs.  
510,"well, bugs are part of the experience.  They are not so bad in the cooler weather"
510,That is true.  In the summer bugs are terrible except for all the butterflies.  They are awesome.
510,"yes, but where I live it gets very hot in the summer so camping then is not so nice.  I camping better in the fall or spring"
510,Camping in spring here is cool and wet.  Not the best.
510,I've camped in the rain before too.  not fun!  but its the experience that counts
510,":-)  Yep, camping in the rain is definitely an experience you will not forget."
510,do you camp in parks or in other paid campgrounds?
510,Parks as much as possible.  They are more scenic.
511,"Plus, wouldn't you agree that when you benefit from working hard, it's easier to get motivated to do so?"
511,That is so true. I feel the same way. It's nice a nice feeling to really earn your money.
511," It's like my fiancé and his allowance from his dad. The more he does around the house, the bigger the allowance he gets."
511,"I'm surprised that your fiance still gets an allowance from his dad, I presume he's of working age?"
511,"He is. But he lives with his parents still. We're looking foward to leaving Kentucky together, I'd like to go live in Seattle."
511,Why do you want to go and live in Seattle?
511,"Many reasons, but mostly because of the fifteen dollars an hour minimum wage. That city values a fair worker compensation."
511,"Right ok, that's pretty good. What do you do for a living?"
512,It makes it easier to watch. What are your favorite movies? 
512,i like all kinds of movies to watch with my family
512,I like horror and romance the most. A little bit of evil and light lol. Some people say that I am a hopeless romantic because of it. 
512,horror movies are a good way to take your mind of of things. the Halloween movies were fantastic. Nice and frightening
512,Yep I guess it really makes you think about life and how things can really be. 
512,It makes you appreciate the quality of life we all are afforded.
512,Yes it does I guess sometimes I wear my heart on my sleeve because I have been naive in the past
512,sometimes being naive is a comfortable way of living. Knowing too much can make you bitter
512,Yeah that's really true
512,everyone needs to get out in the real world to stay sane! or at least try to stay sane. haha
512,Lol that makes a whole lot of sense
512,it's all depends on ones attitude
513,You're not wrong. I wish I could make time to plan a trip to see them perform.
513,Where are they playing next? I heard the tickets cost a fortune.
513,"I'm not sure. When I lived in Chicago, I think it was at least a hundred per seat. Must be more now. "
513,"Yeah, no doubt. Still, it must be worth it. Do you like any other similar bands?"
513,"I must admit I'm a fan of the classics, The Doors, Nirvana... if I wasn't so busy with my law degree I'd go to concerts more often."
514,"Hmm, then perhaps you should get a cat too? I have one in my tiny house, it keeps critters away!"
514,"I can't. I'm allergic, and even if I wasn't I don't like cats. Or any dirty animals. Should we call pest control?"
514,Have you seen any mice indoors? If not then baited traps should do the trick
514,"No, not indoors yet. I'll try. I don't know how you can stay so calm? I'm about ready to get in my car and leave."
514,"I suppose it's the serious, responsible lawyer-to-be in me that stays calm in any situation. Plus, they're not inside!"
514,"Yet! Haha. You're right, I'm getting overly worried due to my phobias, but it's just so hard to stay calm. I might go and work on my car to relax"
514,How has it been going with that car? You seem to have been working on it for months!
514,Yeah. The truth be told I don't think I'll ever finish. It drives the wife mad but a man needs his space. What do you do to relax?
515,"He is my hero, I have always looked up to him"
515,"Yeah, My dad always my hero. I am prayer god to recover your dad."

530,"I love museums as well, they really help teach the public about different things we may not otherwise know"
530,I agree. At the science museum I visited they had many interactive things to learn and experiment with. That was a lot of fun!
530,"O awesome, so its more of a general public museums and not one of the niche ones more meant for researchers?"
530,"Well, it wasn't the Smithsonian if that is what you mean. "
530,"Do you like museums? I have a lot of friends,that go to museums"
530,"Yes, I love museums. I work at one that is a science museum."
530,"O wow, is it more of a local museum or one of the larger ones they have in major cities?"
530,It is a larger museum in a major city. 
530,"i love dogs and cats,seeing the art of animals is inspirational.i love the city"
531,oh really? is that something that interest you?
531,"Not really.  I""d rather do research in a lab."
531,"i get that, labs can get interesting.  but my passion is gymnastics"
531,Rhythmic gymnastics is interesting because many people manipulate pieces like ropes or hoops. I could see why the rhythmic aspect makes it seem like a dance.
531,"Being tall helps with different routines, and i have to be in shape to do it, so it is a lot of work"
531,"True, you need good upper and lower body strength, as well as muscular endurance. I think it would be difficult."
531,yes because of this i have been considered well built but im afraid my passion wont pay the bills so thats why im in labs
531,"understandably , probably mostly brain power is needed ."
531,yes does take a lot of consentration and smarts
531,I'm sure it takes patience too.
531,of course.  but it can be rewarding with the final product
531,Very true.  It must be a proud moment for you when you achieve the final product.
532,i enjoy watching saturday night live
532,Saturday Night Live is a very funny show. I didn't know it was ending though?
532,"they have 44 seasons,star was a tv series in it only had 3 seasons,in that ended"
532,"I did not know it was ending, sorry to hear that!"
532,shows tend to get good at the end 
532,Yes they do and then they leave you hanging and wanting more!
532,"absolutely!!! iMy mom and dad are both a red head,when i watch tv series most people have red hair in some dont"
532,It is always comforting to see others who are similar to us on television.
532,"yes Im six feet tall,in when my family watches tv they sit behind me"
532,"That must make it a little difficult for them to see the tv then, unless they are even taller than you are?"
532,"my dad is 6,9 my mom is 5,5"
532,"Well, it sounds like your height landed nicely right in between their heights then. "
533,"What a great profession! I've always wanted to teach. I love to read, so English would probably be my preferred study"
533,"I enjoy teaching others, you would be surprised at how much there is to know about nature and the environment. "
533,I can only imagine! What do you teach?
533,In my latest travels I have been teaching about aviculture being necessary due to the effects on various bird species. You should read my blog!
533,SOunds interesting!
533,You could travel and teach English ESL! I hear it is a fun and lucrative job.
533,"That would be a dream! I have small children, so it will have to stay a dream. Do you have children?"
533,No not yet but I would still do what I do. My mother was a teacher as well and we had many great adventures.
533,Good for you! That's great that you had that experience with your Mother. My Mom just moved 3 states away. She's living her dream on the beach now :)
533,How wonderful! One thing I learned is...A trip across 3 states is just as exciting and beautiful as across the ocean. You should visit your mom. :)
533,That's wonderful advice. Thank you for that!
533,it is always good to take time to visit or go on vacation with your family. I wish I could! Take care!
534,"Hello, how are you today?"
534,I am doing all right! Are you going to be moving very far?
534,"Not very far, about an hour away. "
534,"Oh that's not too far at all. Moving can be quite stressful, but it you find yourself a good spot it is so worth it"
535,"I have been to Six Flags in Georgia, what about you?"
535,"I have been to Six Flags in Gurnee, IL and near St. Louis, MO. However, I much prefer Universal Studios Orlando over both."
535,"Really, I would love to go to Universal Studios. I bet it was really fun."
535,"It is amazing, especially if you love thrill rides. Sea World also has some great coasters. I also LOVE Disney World!"
535,"Wow, sounds amazing. I have got to set a goal and go to d"
535,You totally should. You are NEVER too old to enjoy Disney! People from all ages ride the rides!
535,This would be an awesome experience for me and my family. I would love to experience this.
535,Definitely take your whole family. There is something for everyone to enjoy.
535,"Thank you so much, I am definitely considering going in the next few years. What roller coasters do you like?"
535,"At Disney - Expedition Everest. Watch it on YouTube if you've never seen it. Also, Rock N Roller Coaster."
535,"Thank you, I will. Sounds exciting. I think I would love the Rock N Roller Coaster. These rides give you a real thrill and excitment. "
535,"Yes, it is in the dark, indoors and goes upside down and has inversions. It is a launch coaster. So much fun!"
535,"Great, thank you for the advice. I will definitely check these out. "
535,No problem! Hope you are able to go and have a great time!
535,"I need some fun time, too much going on around here to enjoy myself. "
535,I am sorry to hear that. Sometimes we all need to take a break and get away for a bit. It's good for the soul.
535,"I hear you. So good to talk to you, you have made my day!"
535,You as well. Have a great afternoon! :)
536,What do you watch? I like comic books so I'm big into the CW shows
536,Oh the CW. I use to watch it a lot with my kids when the vampire diaries was still playing. I really liked that show
536,How funny! I have children myself so tv watching is a luxury these days it seems :)
536,Oh for sure! It is such a blessing when we all have a show we enjoy watching together
536,My girls are in the preteen years so we have been watching a lot of YA stuff lately
536,Oh that's nice. My two daughters are 18 and 20
536,I bet that's fun! Great ages!
536,"Yeah, one is in college already, and the other is prepared her appplications"
536,Oh wow! Will they be close to home?
536,"Yes, thankfully! They it looks like they will both be attending the same college next year and it will only be about an hour away"
536,Great news! Just far enough away from home but close enough too. 
536,Yes! I am already excited for my eldest daughter to come home for thanksgiving dinner!
537,It was terrible.  I'm still really shaken up about it.
537,Oh god its a so sad news. how it happended its due to traffic collision.
537,Yes.  A drunk driver.
537,"Yes, drinking and driving can cause traffic accidents. "
537,too many.  I don't drink and drive. Do you drink and drive?
537,"Yes I do drive however, I am a careful driver "
537,That's good to know.  So am I.  Have you ever lost anyone to a car accident?
537,"No, however, I knew people that were killed"
537,Terrible tragedies.  What kind of car do you drive?
537,I drive a BMW and yourself? 
537,Toyota.  I think it's nice and safe.
537,Yes they are nice cars
538,No worries!
538,when are you moving to canada?
538,It'll probably be middle of next year before I'm able. I live with my best friend and we are waiting on her to finish school
538,"that's nice, I have always wanted to go there. hold on a minute I gotta feed Toto, he won't stop barking"
538,"Toto? Like, from The Wizard of Oz?"
538,"yeah my grandma used to tell me that story old the time, don't why she's from denmark though XD"
538,"Denmark? Wow, that's cool! Have you been there?"
538,"nah, never, maybe one day. denmark, canada, or anything up north, I want to see aurora borealis :)"
538,Ahh! The Northern Lights! That would be a site to see
539,"I know right, everything is falling into place finally after all that has happened."
539,What happened before?
539,"Well all that trauma of losing a loved one, has a big impact on life."
539,"That's sad, how long ago was it?"
539,"It's been a pretty long time, about 10 years, i remember it like it was yesterday. "
539,"Yes, and you're happier now.  With life going the way you want it to go."
539,Exactly! How about your life at the moment? 
539,It seems to be looking up for me as well!  I couldn't be happier!
539,What has happened lately? 
539,I got a new job and things are going more smoothly.  How about you?
539,"Oh wonderful, what job is it? I got a new pet."
539,Secretary.  What kind of pet?
540,It is a director post at the top fashion magazine in the States.
540,That sounds like a great job. Is it what you've wanted your whole life?
540,"Yes, i get to look at people and their outfits and make a judgement call"
540,Do you make judgement calls on your own outfits before going out with them?
540,"No way, since I do not eat pizza, I do whatever works for me"
540,How can you not eat pizza? It's the best! But maybe not as good as chocolate milk.
540,"I agree, but look at Tom Brady. In his new book, he said he doesn't eat cheese! How can this be"
540,Maybe he is lactose intolerant.
540,"baha I like chocomilk too, but the parameters of my character do not. I randomly thought of the song, Mr. president by Cocojumbo, its wild"
540,I have never heard of that artist. What genre do they fit in?
540,"I would say, reggae and dance music. Its definitely from the 90s or early 2000s"
540,Would you compare the reggae portion to Bob Marley?
541,I tried but it went straight to voicemail...
541,Maybe lost the network...
541,"That's what I am thinking, he is in an area that is prone to do that."
541,Were you able to eventually get a hold of him?
541,"I left a message, I'm waiting for him to call me back when he gets service again."
541,Is the signal just bad where he's at? Or is it just a bad carrier?
541,"It's the signal...It doesn't matter what carrier you have, calls get dropped all the time. "
541,"Well, hopefully you hear back soon. Did it drop right away or after a while?"
541,I was able to talk to him a few minutes before the drop...the wind must of changed direction. lol
541,"Yeah, lol, doesn't seem to take much sometimes."
541,I was trying to see if I could get some kind of a signal booster for his house.
541,Might be a good idea if they don't cost too much and aren't too hard to install
542,So you like to deep sea fish?
542,"I haven't ever been deep sea fishing, but i'm it's on my to do list."
542,Do you like to fish at a lake or river?
542,"Mainly on a river, i seem to catch more!"
542,I like to fish but I don't like to put worms on the line or take the fish off the hook.
542,That's a main part of fishing though! I prefer flies or meat.
542,"I""ll just use fishing lures.  and my husband can take the fish off the hook!"
542,"Wow, i didn't know they existed, that would help a lot."
542,"Sure, they come in many sizes and colors and such.  Easy peasy"
542,"I once cut my hand real bad with a fishing hook, this lure would prevent this. "
542,Ouch.  I've never hurt myself fishing.  Do you fish often?
542,"Mainly on a weekend when i have free time, do you? "
543,"Yeah for sure! I just got back from Souda Bay, Greece last week."
543,"My identical sibling lives in Greece! I have been so busy baking cakes, that I baked my passport into the second layer"
543,Lol! Do you travel as well? My mother is a well known celebrity so we are always jumping from place to place.
543,"As a kid yes! It's in my blood to travel, I have been to 17 countries, and I love it. where have you been?"
543,Wow thats a lot of places! I'm actually working on doing some short films for school and just got done traveling with my mom in southeast Asia.
543,wow thats neat! what are the films about? I would love to go back to SE asia and eat the oodles of noodles lol
543,Most of them have been documentaries about the fishing villages off the coastlines and how they live day to day. The noodles are to die for down there lol!
544,Why California
544,I love the Monterey area.  I love the sunshine and the water.  
544,I thought the same thing but hardly ever get a chance to enjoy the beach.
544,Were you busy working?
544,Yes. Between that and family obligations it doesn't leave a lot of time for sun and fun.
544,I hear that!  That's why I'd like to move to California.  I feel like I'd be on vacation every day
544,Do you have to work or are you retiring?
544,I'd have to work but I would still feel like I was on vacation
544,At first I did too but now it seems like everyone is on vacation BUT me!
544,"I lived in Galveston, TX and worked and it felt like I was on vacation every day"
544,That's good. I hope you enjoy it. When do you plan on moving out there?
544,maybe next year.  I have to save up some money first.
545,"Oh, it was. We spent a lot of time together as kids. "
545,"It is always fun to get together with old friends to relive past times,"
545,It really is. Do you get together with old friends a lot?
545,"Recently, I have gotten together with a number of all friends. I recently went to a reunion for my high school basketball coach"
545,How fun! Did you play basketball much in high school? 
545,Yes. I loved to play.  I was a gym rat who played every chance I got.  Do you enjoy playing sports?
545,"I'm a little too out of shape for sports now, unfortunately! I do often take my kids on outdoors walks, though. Is walking a sport? lmao "
545,Getting outdoors and getting exercise is what counts.  Race walking is a sport.
545,I suppose you're right. :) Race walking--I've never heard of that. Maybe I should look into it!
545,Race walking is actually an Olympic sport.  I think they walk long distances in the competitions.
545,I guess that makes sense. It sounds like it's more about endurance than speed. That's fantastic.
545,Yes it is.  Although they walk very fast.  It is a little comical to watch as their hips really get a workout.
546,Nobody is home and I heard a loud shriek from down there...
546,do you think it was a ghost?
546,I can only hope it was a stray cat that got trapped
546,Maybe you should go check.  ease your mind a bit
546,Definitely not! I'll just wait until my step dad gets home from work!
546,Do you still hear the shrieks? 
546,"No, its been quiet for awhile now. I've been distracting myself by studying some lines for a upcoming show I have with my theater group"
546,"yes, take your mind off of it.  What's the name of the show?"
546,"""Locally Grown"" Its about a all girl gang in San Francisco "
546,Sounds interesting. I'd love to check that out!
546,If you're ever in the Nashville area you should! That's where my theater group works out of.
546,i should ! that sounds wonderful ! thank you for the offer !
547,I am pretty anxious about my exam. I still have to study a lot.
547,Tests are stressful. I like to study in the library.
547,"Yes, I do too. That way I am not distracted so much. And it is nice and quiet in the library."
547,Sometimes I like being alone so the library is perfect.
547,Yes. I agree with you there. I like to go for a walk around the block to sometimes by myself. Just to clear my head.
547,That seems like a nice way to relax
547,It is. Especially if it is nice weather outside.
547,Do you have nice weather right now?
547,"Yes, it is about 68 degrees and sunny right now."
547,Where do you live?
547,I live in Florida. How about you? Where do you live?
547,"I'm not from Florida, but I'm here for college. Are you in school?"
548,yes I was
548,i see.  and now?
548,"Now, I look back and it just makes me embarrassed! "
548,"so, what was it that you slipped on?"
548,I slipped on the white lace runner. My heel got caught on it.
548,"wow, that must have been embarassing ..."
548,"Oh, it was!"
548,i can only imagine - like walking out of the bathroom with toilet paper on your shoe!
548,I haven't had that happen thankfully! Anyways how is your day
548,it's ok.  mom is feeling bad so we may have to take her to the hospital again
548,No... I hope she feels better soon. I will keep her in my prayers
548,"yeah, thanks.  hopefully it's something that passes or for which actual science can do something"
548,What exactly is going on with her?
549,hu
549,Oh no! It looks like kitty struck again. Maybe your cat wants to dance ballet too!
549,"Yes, my cat and I love ballet"
549,I wonder if they teach cat ballet at the Royal Ballet School? Haha!
549,"Maybe, I'll have to look into it. Lol"
549,So do you dance ballet yourself? Or do you just watch it?
549,I love to watch. It's a very delicate sport and thats what i love about it.
549,"Absolutely! There's a dancer I saw on Facebook recently who is obese, and she's challenging traditional views of dancers. I love her. :)"
549,"Very nice, what is this dancers name"
549,"I think her name is Lizzy Howell. She's 15, and she's been dancing for 10 years. I think it takes a lot of bravery!"
549,It's amazing how young they can start dancing
549,"Gosh, it is. I started really young too. I'm so glad my parents let me do it."
550,I prefer the green leaves. How about you?
550,"purple, here.  just a color thing, i guess"
550,"Ha! It might be. Green is my favorite color, so you might be on to something. I love to make smoothies with kale in the morning."
550,"don't know about smoothies but ""greens"" are good for you"
550,"Yes, they are. I have an autoimmune disease, so I try to eat as clean as possible. I don't know if it helps, but I like to think it does."
550,"oh, sorry to hear that.  what's your problem, if you don't mind my asking?"
550,I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and a few other health issues. I do just about everything I can to keep from having flares. 
550,"ah.  i get that, or some of it - osteoarthritic, here; pain and a bad health care system ... (sigh)"
550,"Yes, then you understand. I am sorry that you have pain also. Don't get me started on our health care system. Yikes!"
550,"yep.  if you don't have the money don't be thinking you're going to get the help you need.  it's unfortunate, really."
550,"I agree. We have insurance, but we still pay over $10,000 out of pocket every year. It is quite depressing."
550,"glad you've got some insurance.  if i had the money i'd go to the street to get what i need, that's how bad it is"
550,I am so sorry to hear that. I will say some extra prayers for you.
551,"That's so funny, my daughter hasn't stopped watching Moana on repeat since last week."
551,"Ha ha! Don't be annoyed, that's what children do! believe me!"
551,How many children do you have?
551,I have only one child. A girl. She always has wished that she had siblings. How many do you have?
551,"Same here, my daughter just turned 5 last month. Thankfully she hasn't mentioned wanting sibling yet."
551,"Oh, that is good. I have 1 sister and I feel sorry for my daughter sometimes. I can understand that she would like to have a brother or sister."
551,"Yeah it can be lonely for children sometimes, But my daughters friends practically live at our house anyways haha."
551,"Yes, I know. My daughter has a lot of friends too, and they play at our house a lot too. They also have sleepovers. "
551,I've recently started entertaining them by just letting them do all the work in our garden since they love being outdoors anyway
551,That sounds like a good plan. How big is your garden?
551,"We live in NYC so its not large at all haha, about 10 feet by 10 feet"
551,"Oh, that is not so big. I think that our yard is about half an acre. Hahaha. "
552,no i'm in texas
552,I love Texas.
552,my dad died when i was in high school
552,"Oh, its very hard to hear. What happened?"
552,He was shot in the line of duty
552,I am so sorry for your loss! 
552,I can only listen to metal music
552,Metal is the best!!
552,It's my favorite type of music
552,I love good head banging music!!!!!
552,me to
552,Did you graduate?
553,I love the beach! Its one of my favorite places. How about you?
553,"I do enjoy the beach, but I prefer the spring over the summer."
553,I agree. Its very hot in the summer. Spring is beautiful with all of the fresh blossoms. 
553,Yes the changing leaves inspires me when painting.
553,Wow! What types of things do you like to paint?
553,Mostly landscape. Do you enjoy art?
553,I dont paint but I enjoy baking cakes and decorating them. Its my form of art. 
553,That sounds yummy! Is baking a hobby of yours?
553,"Yes, it is! Do you like to cook or bake?"
553,I mainly enjoy the eating part.
553,HAHA! Who doesnt? What is your favorite food?
553,Well when I am painting I like to snack on fresh butter croissants.
554,"Yes, I'm okay. I feel really lucky."
554,That's good to hear. Glad you're ok.
554,"Thank you. It was scary, but nobody is hurt."
554,"I sure hope you are ok.  Traffic collisions often can cause injury, even death."
554,I'm always careful about making my family wear seatbelts.
554,Definitely! Seatbelts are life saving devices for sure.  Never know when they will be needed.
554,Do you drive?
554,Yes I do.  Everyday
554,Me too. It's usually so boring. Do you listen to the radio?
554,Can't drive without it!  Usually bluetooth my music files and listen to various playlists I have.  
554,I love listening to music.
554,same here ! what kind of music do you listen to ?
555,"I know it is a major climbing destination, but I did not know that it is part of the National park. Very interesting!"
555,"mmh.  such a beautiful mountain.  don't know about the rest of the park, tho"
555,It is! My husband read a book about it from Ernest Hemingway. He said it was a great book!
555,"i remember the story, The Snows of Kilimanjaro"", such a powerful piece:  ""there.  there is where we are going"".  <nods>"
555,Yes! I will have to read it. Have you every visited Africa?
555,"no, never.  you?"
555,"No, but I would love to. It looks so beautiful! "
555,"yeah.  but i'd be afraid.  the politics, the uncertainty, etc.  it would have to be a very well prepared group for me to go ..."
555,"I understand, but I would go just to see the animals. I spend all my free time at our local shelter, so Africa would be a dream!"
555,"i see.  yeah, i'd also be worried about the animals, but get your drift.  so you like animals, huh?"
555,"I understand you anxiety about going. That is how my husband feels. Yes, I love animals. "
555,do you have any pets?
556,"That sounds interesting to someone like myself haha, I usually don't hear stuff like that working my 9-5"
556,I like to take time to learn new things. It was a means of language in old times. 
556,What do you do for your day job?
556,"I work in IT, how about you?"
556,"I currently work a dead end job selling snakeskin oil, trying desperately to get out of it."
556,Dead end jobs are rough. What would you like to be doing for work if you could do anything?
556,I would love to be a white water rafting guide!
556,Wow! That sounds like a very fun job! Why is keeping you from persuing it?
556,Just trying to build up the confidence and commit to quitting honestly.
556,I understand the fear of being unsure about that decision. I think you can succeed!
556,Next year I should have the savings to pursue it for sure!
556,Do you live somewhere close to rivers for the rafting?
557,Oh no! I dont care for road rage. I am just glad we were safe!
557,good ! glad you all are safe . so whats your hobbies now ?
557,I love to ride horses!
557,"i used to ride horses , but i have not in a while !"
557,It is such a fun experience. I would like to own one of my own one day.
557,i would love to be able to have horses
557,What hobbies do you enjoy?
557,"I like nature walks, especially going on walks with my children. "
557,"Oh yes, and this time of year is so great for that because the weather is mild."
557,I really do like outdoor activies too like natural walks out of the town.
557,Its nice to get outside. I love to go to the beach. Its so calming
557,The beach is great. Do you have any pets? 
558,My mom actually makes us picnic lunches every weekend!
558,those are seriously the best ! i do them all the time with my kids
558,How many children do you have?
558,I have 2! Do you have any children?
558,"Sadly no, me and my partner expect to have one in the near future though!"
558,Just stay positive it will happen when the time is right!
558,Yeah honestly it doesn't help going to the park so much and seeing all the parents with their children haha
558,Your absolutley right. I actually have infertility so we had to take some extra measures to have children. And dealt with a few losses along the way. 
558,"Oh wow i'm so sorry to hear that, I'm glad it all worked out for you."
558,Thank you. Its still upsetting due to the fact that I can never have them on my own. 
558,I'm assuming you had a surrogate help you in that regard?
558,No we actually didnt need to have to have a surrogate. I had to get ovulation medication and hormones to keep my pregnancies
559,"I enjoy renting versus owning, helps be mobile and not go through the home buying and selling process.  How about you?"
559,I have owned my own home for some time now.
559,awesome! congrats
559,Thanks! Renting a home would be a disaster with all the kids I have. 
559,I understand.  I want kids
559,Well take it from myself. I never thought I would have more than one but I now have three!
559,Hopefully I can find someone one day to have a family with.  What do you do for a living?
559,"I am a nurse, how about yourself?"
559,Aspiring writer and work part time as a bartender
559,Sounds like fun! I work early in the morning. You must work later then as a bartender.
559,"Yeah, usually 6-12 or 2.  Varies.  It doesn't bother me though, I just need 4-5 hours of sleep and I'm good."
559,That's typically the amount of sleep I used get with my kids when they were younger. Drove me crazy!
560,"nope, i'm in texas; there's a sears in irving.  evansville, huh?  did not know that"
560,"i remember shopping at sears  many times. and now they're almost gone,like Blockbuster, another business killed by the internet"
560,"yeah.  i keep hearing they're about to go completely under.  o well, i don't really want to sell washing machines at sears, anyway :("
560,i remember my parents taking me to sears and buying me a basketball when i was little.its probably why basketball is my favorite sport
560,"o yeah?  yeah.  some stores play big in my childhood memories, too.  woolworth's, for instance.  no b-ball, tho ..."
560,i remember woolworths.wow.i hadn't thought of them in years.i cant believe toys r us and kb toys are gone.thanks to private equity firms and leveraged buyouts
560,"i wouldn't know why they're gone, i just remember my first experience of an escalator was in one.  so, you know something about business?"
560,i know a little.what s your favorite sport?
560,"i watch a (very) little nfl these days.  i've moved away from watching a lot of tv, period, tho, including sports.  used to watch a lot."
560,what did you replace tv time with?tell me it was reading novels.id respect you so much for that
560,"no.  i mostly caregive my elderly mom who has alzheimer's.  and formalisms.  math, mainly."
560,"oh.i respect you even more for doing that.i now that must be hard for you, physically and mentally"
561,"Yes, and I love to play tennis!"
561,Oh i'm jealous! I tried tennis and I was terrible at it haha.
561,It takes some practice! What are your hobbies?
561,"I honestly just enjoy being outdoors, I love learning new sports."
561,Its so nice to get outside and enjoy the weather!
561,Agreed. So what else do you do for fun?
561,I love reading mystery books in my free time. Reading is my favorite hobby
561,So like Crime mystery?
561,"Yes, its one of my favorites. Do you like to read?"
561,"I read occasionally, But usually it's hard to sit for that long and focus."
561,"Haha, I can understand that. Especially because everyone leads such busy lives these days."
561,What do you do for work?
562,That's cool. Did you not feel like going?
562,"No not really, I felt like just having a girl's weekend back here."
562,That sounds like fun!
562,Yeah there is nothing like getting some chores done during the day and then unwinding with a bottle of wine in the evening!
562,You got that right! Did you get everything done that you needed to?
562,"Oh no not at all, but my husband is still gone for another two days. So what do you do for fun?"
562,I like to go to car shows and relax and enjoy time with the family
562,Classic cars shows or more modern ones?
562,Classic and imports
562,Oh that sounds like fun! I honestly am completely clueless when it comes to cars.
562,That's okay honestly. It can take some time to learn about them
562,I just let my husband handle all the mans work when it comes to stuff like that haha.
563,The first thing i did was to go and buy a lottery ticket!
563,Did your lottery ticket win?
563,"I'm still waiting, the draw isn't until next week. I'm so excited"
563,"I would be anxious, hopefully you win!"
563,"I am very anxious, imagine if i did win! I'd buy a bigger shop."
563,What kind of shop do you have?
563,It's only a small shop that sells bakery items.
563,I love bakery shops. Did you know that Romans were the first developers of bakeries?
563,"I did not know that, how interesting, i wonder what the first bakery was called."
563,I don't know. They have been around for a long time. Maybe there's records of it someplace!
563,"It'd be fun to find out, and about the kind of bread they would sell. "
563,It would be cool to replicate some of the original Roman recipes to pay homage to the history!
564,I hate running also but your right it is meditative
564,Even though it is a chore I run at least two miles a day for the benefits.
564,The benefits can be so amazing yet rewarding at the same time
564,So what else do you do for your mental health?
564,I love writing
564,"Maybe I should try that, My daughter just graduated college and I have been stressing about her getting a job."
564,Writing can help with things that stress you. Your daughter will find a job. Just try to be positive
564,Do you usually write fiction or non-fiction? 
564,I like to write both
564,"I think I could get into fiction writing, I always love a good fantasy novel."
564,Even if you write for yourself it really relieves alot
564,Do you ever let others read your stories?
564,"Not many people, I would like to I just haven't done it yet"
565,"ah yes, liquid refreshment.  ;)"
565,That's what's best about brunch haha
565,"anything in particular?  manhattan, ipa, wine?  i rarely drink anymore, but i'm given to ipa's"
565,It's better to have something simple and easy like a wine cooler or beer. Chicken and beer is even better.
565,"ah, yes.  i like the fried chicken.  not sure beer's a good ""after breakfast but before lunch"", tho, but ..."
565,"Haha, well it is because it's not as strong as wine or anything else. I mean, it's not as fancy but it's sufficient. "
565,yes.  so long as it's good it's sufficient ...
565,"Yes, it is very good. IMO. "
565,"what else do you like, foodwise or drinkwise, any time of the day-wise?"
565,"I love some seafood! Oysters, crabs, the whole nine."
565,"mm, yum!  oysters, crab, but i have a special affinity for *lobster* 8D"
565,"Yes, lobster is pretty nice. Honestly, I could eat anything. Good thing I don't have any pets. LOL"
566,What do you .i
566,"When I was young, my favorite candy was gummy bears. My family always bought them for me"
566,Is it still your favorite candy ?
566,Yes! I like different variations including sour ones!
566,The sour ones are the best . My best childhood memories when my family bought me a new cd for my CD collection.
566,A CD collection? That's really cool! I like to listen to music with my parakeet!
566,Yes i have large CD collection. A parakeet ? What songs does it like ?
566,My parakeet likes classical music! 
566,That's sweet ! I would be afraid have one at home as it's filled with rare vintage furniture.
566,It is worth it for their companionship!
566,For sure.Do you have any other animals you listen music with ?
566,Just my parakeet.
567,It's great because now I'll be able to afford my medications.
567,Do you have a health condition?
567,I do. I need medicine to keep my heart running correctly. 
567,Oh wow i'm so glad that you can afford that now. 
567,"Me too, it would be catastrophic if I went without medications. "
567,"I actually just got off some medications for my skin and had some weight gain side effect, so now i just feel over weight"
567,"Side effects are the worst, I have a weight gain side effect with my heart meds. I know how you feel."
567,Yeah its kinda depressing because I was on my meds to be more desired but now i'm over weight too now
567,Weight doesn't determine attractiveness. You have a lot to offer.
567,"Thanks, that really helps with my confidence knowing other people think that."
567,It's the truth! We all have something to offer and we're all worthy.
567,"You're so right, I love your kind words and optimistic outlook! "
568,yep.  imagine ... if chapman hadn't killed him.  and maybe george hadn't died of brain cancer
568,Who knows where music would be today in that case!
568,"yeah, and i wonder what john might have to say about the current politics of the world <shrug> o well"
568,Do you own lots of things related to The Beatles?
568,"no, not really.  i followed them after they broke up, musically of course.  still have mcartney's ""ram"" on vinyl somewhere.  you?"
568,No not really. I prefer to get my enjoyment through reading.
568,what do you read?
568,I love reading on the topic of environmental change. Especially on how it affects animals.
568,"ah.  there will be big, *bad*, changes for all of us animals if we don't do something soon ..."
568,Indeed. I just think it is horrible for the wildlife that has been affected by our actions.
568,"yes?  the insectidae are dropping, too - great big ecosystem, nothing will be unaffected, i think"
568,Do you partake in political discussions in relation to climate change?
569,"yea, they are great. i really want my favorite team to go to the superbowl next year"
569,What's your favorite team?
569,The New Orleans Saints! What are your favorite football and basketball teams?
569,Cavaliers and Buccaneers! Just realized they rhyme. Haha
569,Lol! They do. Nice. Do you have any pets?
569,A dog named Bucko. You?
569,Yes. A cat. A Cornish Rex. Her name is Delphi. She's a rescue from my local shelter.
569,Wooowwww. That's cool. Any plans to get more pets in the future?
569,Yes. I need a bigger apartment first! I love pets and there are so many who need homes!
569,Aww. That's a sweet goal. Maybe I'll go to a shelter and get me one from there someday..
569,Yes! Please adopt from a shelter. We need to do our part to help pets recover from terrible owners.
569,Amen. I feel you on that one. I've been reading a lot about environmental and social causes. I want to take part and do something!
570,i can't stand the humidity
570,There is not much humidity where I live in the mountains.
570,I love the mountains
570,Me too! I want a truck one day to be able to get around easier.
570,I have a cousin who put truck tires on a lincoln continental LOL
570,Your cousin sounds like a funny person!
570,When I said something about it they kind of took offense. Where I am from we have only man made hills. My cousin is in WV
570,Where did he get the truck tires?
570,I have no idea LOL we lower our cars here
571,Ha! Yes and then I woke up and started looking for my next job!
571,Well it's good that you got some rest. What job are you looking for?
571,Currently I'm looking for something that I can be close to the water!
571,Do you enjoy working close to the water?
571,Sure do! How about you? Do you prefer the sea or the mountains?
571,I prefer the mountains. My favorite season is winter and I think snow-covered pine trees are beautiful!
571,"How neat, but we are totally different! I love the heat of the summer and the smell of the sea!"
571,I love the sea but I'm a sleepy mountain town kind of person. The heat gets too much sometimes!
571,"I understand! The heat can be oppressing at times! I do enjoy the beautiful leaves of the trees in the fall, they are refreshing!"
571,"The bright oranges during fall are breathtaking. I do love the blue of the ocean, my eyes are the same color as the sea."
571,My favorite are the burnt red hues! Red is my favorite color!
571,That's amazing. Red Compliments blue!
572,No just two pairs of blue adidas shoes
572,Guess you're only short a pair of shoes... 
572,Yeah but I am bummed because that was my favorite pair of shoes. 
572,Any idea who stole them?
572,I think it might have been my neighbor.  I left them on my porch to air dry them and then they were gone.
572,"Well, they probably wouldn't wear them because that would be obvious. Do they sell sneakers? "
572,Not that I know of
572,"Hmm. Well, did you at least call the police?"
572,Nah it seemed like it was more work than it was worth.  I'm not sure they would do anything.
572,True. So where are you from?
572,"Florida, how about you?"
572,"France. But my parents are irish. Weird combo, I know."
573,"After I grilled, I went in and read the newspaper"
573,i read to my kids each night they love it .
573,What are their favorite books?
573,They love PJ Masks and Curious George books
573,How sweet! My favorite is ender's game.
573,That's a great book for sure
573,Do you have a favorite book?
573,Yes I love James Patterson books they are so easy to read
573,I too enjoy books that are easy to read
573,Do you have any pets?
573,"I do not, do you?"
573,"I have 10 cats, I know I'm a crazy cat person"
574,I love a good NY pizza but they are hard to find
574,I bet! New York is pretty famous for their pizza. I love oversized jumbo new york style pizza. You can find it in the Adams Morgan neighbourhood in DC :)
574,Oh man Adams Morgan has some of the best pizza shops.  I used to live near there!
574,"We have a local pizza shop, so much better than the chain places."
574,Absolutely I used to go to college in Adams Morgan
574,That's cool! I bet being in college you ate a lot of pizza.
574,Definitely it was one of my staple foods...ha!
574,"I may have to make a pizza tonight, lol All this pizza talk is making me hungry!"
574,Me too...good thing I have my favorite pizza shop on speed dial.
574,"I think I may just hit my speed dial also, call up my local shop and get a loaded, thick crust on the way."
574,"Awesome, what type of music do you like to listen to?"
574,I love to listen to Rock-N-Roll and Heavy Metal music. How about you?
575,Is that right! Most people say its to windy but I really enjoy that part of it
575,I live in Chicago as well and I really enjoy the chill factor of the winds! 
575,How long have you lived in the Windy City?
575,I've lived there for two years now!! It's really amazing and I love all of the food options!!!
575,"Thats great to hear. I hear Chicago has the best deep dish pizza, is that true?"
575,Yes!! Chicago is the best place for deep dish pizza. It's the best place to get the authentic deep dish experience!!!!
575,Now I am hungry! One thing I really enjoyed about Chicago is the music scene. There is always so many great bands playing.
575,"I heard a great cover band the other night at a local bar scene. They sung ""Hungry like the wolf,"" which is funny since you mentioned you were hungry!"
576,"Tons of fun things! Food, rides and craft items! Usually they benefit something! Have you ever been to one?"
576,"no, i guess not.  been on a walk for alzheimer's last year tho.  no food, no rides, no crafts"
576,"That's great! My family has done many Alzheimer's functions. My nana passed from Dementia, therefore we are active in the community!"
576,"i'm glad to hear it.  i caregive my mom.  she's just recently forgotten one of my sisters, so it's a slow progression"
576,"Your mom is lucky to have you, take lots of pictures and videos. I wish we would have taken more of my Nana."
576,yeah.  these are what's left - memories.  so how are you/your family otherwise these days?  well?
576,"Yes, thank you! We are always looking for fun things to do so that's one of the reasons we are going to the fall festival. "
576,"what kind of rides or ""fun things"" are you going to do there?"
576,"Eat lots of cotton candy and funnel cake, then, the next morning wish I wouldn't have. "
576,"lol.  yeah, the battle of the bulge is never over : -{D"
576,"Tell me about it, always watching my figure and pinching pennies!"
576,"well, i hope you have a lot of fun.  make those memories, the pennies and figures are ephemeral"
577,"Yeah, it makes things much easier with a job."
577,"yeah, ""things"" are always easier with *m.o.n.e.y.*, the j.o.b. i could actually do without XD"
577,"lol, I second that. I Haven't been working long and already miss my ""free"" time"
577,what would you do if all you had was free time ...
577,I would work on all my craft projects and spend time with my dogs
577,"what kind of dogs?  we have a variety, mostly mutts, almost all rescues"
577,Great pyrenese mix and a pitt bull that was adopted
577,"we've got a shepard mix (""fence""), a long-haired chihuahua mix (""tulip""), and nelson, the weiner dog ..."
577,"We have a total of 6, lol Tucker, Trigger, Abbey, Gypsey, Sophie and Draco. I love them but, they do get expensive."
577,"yeah, i hear that.  good thing the weiner dog will eat practically anything (eye roll)"
577,"Lol..I have a mix, 3 will eat anything..the other 3 are picky! But, that's ok, they are all good and healthy"
577,"yeah, healthy dogs are happy dogs, and these are happy dogs.  "
578,My husband and I are very excited 
578,Do you have any children already or will this be your first?
578,She is our first daughter. We have one son.
578,That's wonderful. I have two daughters 10 and 13. I wish you the best.
578,Thank you. What do your daughters like to do?
578,my daughters both love crafting and they are good at it .
578,That is so cool! I like crafting and art. 
578,i do enjoy crafting too !
578,What do you do for a living?
578,i'm a landscaper. it's hard work but it's very rewarding.
578,"That is cool! I am a stay at home mother, but my husband is an engineer."
578,"Wow, engineering, sounds impressive.  I'm sure the income will be awesome."
579,olive
579,That's an adorable name. My cat's name is Venus.
579,cool
579,What breed is your dog?
579,"um, it's wrinkly and brown?  not sure"
579,Like a pug?
579,"i guess.  wait, a french bulldog!"
579,I love french bulldogs. Their smushed little faces are so cute. Not good for their breathing though.
579,what?  why is it not good for breathing?
579,"Since their snout is smushed up into their face, it makes it more difficult to breathe and fight off colds. "
579,oh ok
579,And they are more prone to heat strokes that way as well. Cute breed but a lot of work to keep healthy. 
580,"mm hmm.  ""be a doer not a follower""; happiness is difficult enough in this world ..."
580,"Family is very important to me personally, but I've learned it's important to go your own way. Fleetwood Mac knew it best."
580,"tusk, rumors, tango in the night ... they're all gettin' kinda old now, tho ..."
580,They are but their music is timeless. I love listening to the oldies.
580,"yes, excellent music from the ""standard"" line-up.  i'm ""listening"" to more ambient these days, quotes on the 'listening'"
580,I listen to a lot of rock and metal but I'm venturing off into dance and pop. It's good to diversify your playlist.
580,i agree with you there.  finding new stuff is a great eye-opener.  that's how i found soundgarden et alii years ago
580,"I love Soundgarden! Tragic about Chris Cornell though. He was a great singer, I saw his band in concert before his passing."
580,"wow, you got lucky.  and, yeah, i couldn't believe it when i heard it.  such a talent.  but people are people."
580,"I couldn't either, such a great musician. What is your favorite genre?"
580,"i'm pretty eclectic in my tastes, it just needs to be well done.  who are you listening to currently?"
580,Same. Recently I am listening to Jinjer. They are a Nu Metal band.How about you?
581,Which is your favorite animal ?
581,"I love all animals, but cats are my favorite. What about you?"
581,I love dogs. I personally  want to own one but they are experience.
581,"They definitely are, but it is worth it!"
581,Do you own a cat?
581,"Yes, I have one. Do you have any?"
581,No not at the moment. Is the cat a girl or boy?
581,She is a girl. I have had her since high school. I am now a graduate student in college.
581,"Aw, what is her name ?"
581,I call her Kitty. 
581,Clever haha! Did you get to bring her to college with you?
581,Only in between classes?
582,What are some of the benefits?
582,"Health benefits for one, like a diet rich in nutrients"
582,"I have read some on it, but I like my protein from my steaks"
582,"I understand that, but there are a number of health issues linked with red meat consumption."
582,"Very true, sometimes I think it is a no win situation, watch your cholesterol, watch your sugar intake "
582,"Yes. I try to have a nice intake of fruit smoothies. They are filling, usually healthy and delicious."
582,Those sound good. I'm just not much of a cook and don't know how to do some of that stuff
582,"Its not hard at all! Just get your favorite fruits, a small cup of plain or flavored yogurt, ice and a blender and you're good to go!"
582,"That's all there is to it ? I could handle that, it sounds easy! Thanks for the info "
582,No problem! Its really great because there are so many different flavor profiles and fruits to play around with.
582,Sounds amazing! I may have stumbled upon something new and healthy.  Hmm...maybe I need to rethink my red meat consumption??
582,"The thing is, you can still enjoy the red meat, just eat it, as with all things, in moderation. Maybe a steak every other week or so."
582,Sounds like a plan in action for me. Thanks for the tips!
583,Maybe you should start coming to my library.
583,"If it's close, I will definitely make that happen. Coffee and learning make a great combo"
583,"Speaking of learning, how did you do on Mr. Lempke's exam?"
583,I aced it as usual!
583,"Nice, me too. Did you get points for the extra credit?"
583,"I made sure to complete the extra credit part, so yes, I got those points."
583,"Good job, I got a 105% with the extra points."
583,Wow! It's always great to do better than perfect.
583,And I love to be perfect.
583,It's my goal with everything I do.
583,Maybe one day you will reach that goal! ;)
583,That's the plan. Little progressive steps is the key.
584,The 5 of us will be the first on the voyage as well as the ones who fund it the most!
584,wow . do you think you will get to mars in your lifetime ?
584,"Well yeah, like I said, we are going to be on the 1st voyage, which will hopefully be in 2024."
584,"Congrats, in order! Need to have a celebration dinner. Just NO beets, I can't stand them"
584,"The only ones I like are candied beets, but those are on a rare occasion."
584,"My mom likes them also, YUCK! I can't cook either. So may have to cater that dinner before you go to Mars"
584,Shawns catering is my favorite just in case you needed to know.
584,Haven't heard of them. What kind of food do they make?
584,"Mostly barbecue, but some greek food."
584,MMM..I love some barbecue and big heaping of tangy slaw
584,My favorite is the brisket and burnt ends.
584,Oh now you're just making me hungry! lol
585,Yes a goat
585,I didn't realize ranches had goats. I've always thought of cattle or horses. Do you have those also?
585,yes
585,"That's fantastic! You must love it? Becky and I looked at some property in the country. It was beautiful, but Becky wanted to be closer to her family."
585,Yes i do. In my year of cheerleading I would help out with the horses.
585,Cheerleading and horses! How interesting. Do you have other hobbies also?
585,I also like to dance 
585,You must be a natural athlete! Do you want to go out dancing sometime with Becky and me?
585,Yes i would love that
585,"There are a couple of places in town we like to go. You can stop by first and see our new place, if you want."
585,Where are you guys from?
585,"Romeo, Michigan. How far is your ranch from there?"
586,"Haha, not that time. That was a different time."
586,Oh shoot. Hey next week my dad and I are going fishing if you want to join us. Maybe you can catch something then.
586,"Oh, I'd really appreciate that! Are you bringing your son with you too?"
586,"No, he is going to stay with his mom, Helga, that weekend."
586,"Ah well, a nice weekend with just the three of us then? Maybe even bring some hotdogs and marshmellows for s'mores?"
586,"I think we had planned on going on just the day trip, like after breakfast to before supper."
586,"Oh, I see. Well a nice day at the river isn't so bad. Did I ever tell you about the day my grandfather and I flipped our canoe? "
586,"No, do we have time to tell it now?"
586,"Oh, I think probably not. But the short of it is that I'd never seen my grandfather so flustered in my life"
586,Oh I can only imagine.
586,"Serves him right for forcing me out on the river, if you ask me"
586,Oh I did not know he forced you on the river!
587,Gosh I love the beach and wish I could go back.
587,"i've been to clearwater before, it's a pretty nice area. Say, did you do anything for Halloween?"
587,"NO, Terrance just wanted to stay home this year so we didn't go out or anything. Did you do anything?"
587,Not really. Just grabbed some pizza and spent some time in watching movies.
587,What movie did you 2 watch?
587,"Ferris Bueller's Day off! Not Halloween themed, but it was good"
587,The parade scene is probably as Halloweeny as that movie gets.
587,"lol, right! Seen anything lately?"
587,Terrance and I have been watching the Scream movie series.
587,Oh those are scary!
587,"Oh a little, we have been watching for the satyr."
587,"Well in that case, I guess I better start hiding!"
588,I wonder how it tastes in Libya.
588,I don't think it would taste much different in Libya. Except maybe a little fresher?
588,"My late husband had some Nigerian coffee two years ago, but I think he was speaking in code. Have you had foreign drinks?"
588,I have not! That sounds like it would be amazing. Coffee is easily one of the most popular drinks in the world
588,"Easily now but I believe it may have been a struggle at first, since most folks drank beer."
588,I've never liked the taste of beer. Do you?
588,"It's an acquired taste, and after years of not drinking I'd say no. It makes me nauseous. Now coffee, that's a proper drink and laxative. Would you disagree?"
588,I don't really like coffee at all! I drank coffee in college to stay awake but it's too bitter for me.
588,Perhaps orange juice would be better for everyone. Less jitters. Less offense to others. Same bowel motivation.
588,I like orange juice but not with pulp. Do you like orange juice with pulp or without?
588,Pulp is rather necessary for that full bodied texture. Otherwise I'
588,"Ugh, the mere thought of pulp makes me gag"
589,He just became detective. It's very exciting for us all!
589,OH! We should throw you 2 a party. Can everyone come over?
589,Haha he's not a man of parties. Maybe we can have you over for dinner one week
589,That would be great. I can cook since we are celebrating you both.
589,"You're very kind, but I want to cook you dish from my home too"
589,"Oh alright, I will allow it. What will you be making?"
589,"Lamb stuffed cabbage, will you eat?"
589,It sounds amazing.
589,It's very good. My husband loves them
589,What day should we come over?
589,Could you come for Saturday lunch? Just before dusk?
589,Works perfect for me. See you then.
590,A pet skunk? You're not afraid of being sprayed?
590,nope haha . my pet skunk is currently running around .
590,So what kind of name do you give to a skunk? You call it Flower like in Bambi or something?
590,LOL! I love it! What a cute name. I might use that in the future.
590,*rolls eyes* Of course you'd like it. Weirdo...lol So what's another weird pet you have?
590,Maybe a cat. They are really sassy.
590,And temperamental as anything. I have scratches all over my arms from cats...*makes hissing noises*
590,lol the things we do for a cat
590,A pet I'd like to have is a snake...I find them fascinating. However they also terrify me so not sure how well that would work.
590,"Oh snakes terrify me, I don't think I could ever keep one as a pet."
590,I'll most likely go with a dog. Boring but loveable as all hell and a lot less crazy than a cat.
590,"i am more of a dog person , love their playful personalities ! cats are sweet though"
590,It's been fun. Take care.
591,"I had no idea! You would think since I drive one, I would know the history. "
591,I really appreciate the level of safety that BMWs have.
591,"Oh, I do too! It helps me feel safe every time I drive it!"
591,But do you actually drive safely?
591,"I feel I do for the most part, but I do drive a little bit over he speed limit sometimes."
591,"In Germany, there are some parts that have no speed limits."
591,I would love to go to Germany and drive on the autobahn. Germany also has nice shopping malls!! lol
591,I haven't heard about their shopping. All I know is that they're great engineers.
591,"Dusseldorf has great Fashion districts! Yes, they are defiantly known for having great engineers. "
591,"I must look into their shopping. If it's anything like their engineering, then I'll be intrigued."
591,"Then again, I have a shopping addiction, or so my husband says! lol"
591,I may have a slight addiction myself.
591,What's that?
592,Do you think it's important to talk slowly to get a dog to listen to you?
592,"Yeah definitely, at least most of the time."
592,I really wish I could get a dog to listen to me. I want to get one
592,"Lol, if only we can understand dogs and listen to what they are saying. That would be hilarious."
592,That would be really funny. What do you think your dogs would say?
592,"I always figure they are just yelling ""Hey!"" with each bark. So what is your favorite food?"
592,I love white cheddar macaroni and cheese. What's yours?
593,"No I havent, have you?"
593,No I only took the class to experience something out of the box but I never did anything more with it. That's my brother
593,"Oh awesome, so what would you usually enjoy experiencing?"
593,I'm more into film. Like to watch old French and Italian movies
593,"That sounds interesting, although not my usual scene."
593,So what's your scene? 
593,I like to get out on my skateboard. I'm usually out quite late!
593,Cowabunga! Skateboard is super cool! How long have you skated for?
593,"Haha, I love that word, 'Cowabunga!', I've skated since I was early teens... Have you ever tried?"
593,"No, I've always been too afraid of climbing on one of those"
593,Oh don't be! It's nothing that knee and elbow pads can't help with :)
593,"Haha, are you telling me you wear those? "
593,Always ;)
594,Yeah my favorite number is 32.
594,I was 44 in football. It has stuck with me since.
594,Ugh the number 44 reminds me of the acres I had on my farm it just got foreclosed on.
594,Oh wow. I'm sorry to hear that.
594,It's ok. I've been wanting to move somewhere warmer
594,Warmer? I love colder places.
594,What do you like about the cold???
594, I like to bundle up and drink hot chocolate by a fire.
594,I love hot chocolate in the winter.Its pretty to drink around Christmas time.
594,Christmas is my favorite holiday!
594,I love Christmas too!!!! I love to look at all the pretty light.
594,Some of the houses around here have competitions with lights.
595,I actually do really like weed and I think that it is beneficial for many people
595,"Yeah. As much as it can have negative side effects for society, it can do good too."
595,yeah my father works at a stifel and has seen that first hang
595,I've traveled around quite a bit and I always feel like the countries that legalized weed have themselves figured out much more.
595,yeah that is totally true
595,Weed being demonized was totally a tactic to target minorities (especially in the US)
595,really? tell me more about that I am not very educated on that topic
595,"Well, people of colour are much more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people even though they consume the same amount"
595,"that is so unfair but I can see how that is true, there is so much inequality stil"
595,One of the founders of ben and jerry's said he wouldn't have been able to start the company if he was black
595,wow i love ben and jerry's i did not know that
595,"I've loved Ben and Jerry's for a while, but that video I saw was really eye-opening"
596,I write poetry. It would be nice to make a living off it.
596,That sounds amazing! I have always loved jobs using creativity. 
596,"Yeah done a bit of everything. Theatre, Spoken Word. I took an Art Class, but turns out I can't draw or paint a lick."
596,I can't paint or draw either! My mom was the artist in the family. 
596,The one time you actually wish you were like your parents lol. What kind of creative job would you like to do?
596,"I wish I could be like my mother, but never my father. I would be a singer for sure!"
596,I love karaoke. And sometimes in the shower I imagine I sound great but secretly I know that I don't. It would be amazing though.
596,"Yes, It would!! It would be amazing to get rich and buy all the burritos I wanted. lol"
596,So that's your favourite food is it? Personally I'm a cheeseaholic.
596,"Yes, but I love cheese also! The more on my burrito the better!!"
596,"Mmmmmmm *makes rapturous drool face.*Think this is my last turn, but it's been fun chatting."
596,"Yes, now I'm hungry! I am going to have to go eat after this!! lol"
597,That's a motto that I live by.
597,"yes , life is wonderful and we need to be grateful ."
597,I agree. Do you meditate?
597,No. I like taking photo.
597,That can be a type of meditation. A beautiful picture can do great things for the mind.
597,Nah I don't think so. Photography is an art. Meditation is just placebo.
597,"It may be a placebo, but it puts a smile on my face."
597,As long as it works for you pal. 
597,"I've always had an interest in photography. The cameras seem so expensive, though."
597,Are they? I don't find them expensive.
597,"I'm not exactly wealthy, so I guess it's more of a perception thing."
597,No it's a rich or poor thing. 
598,"Did it really, I would have figured Spain."
598,I know! I was surprised by this fact too! Do you do any other styles of Dance?
598,Primarily waltz and ballroom.
598,Amazing! I'm currently taking a teach
598,What is taking a teach?
598,"Sorry, I accidentally hit the enter key. I am currently taking my associate level teaching exam in Ballroom. I am finding te amount of turn challenging to remember!"
598,I have found it easiest to block everything out and simply listen to the music.
598,That doesn't help for your oral exam though!
598,"Oh, yes, you are right."
598,What other interests do you have? I love driving my van around doing odds and ends
598,I have been getting into browsing stocks more right now.
598,Now that does sound interesting! Tell me more
599,We sell them to friends and family who like game.
599,"oh wow thats cool, i am a student so I don't get to do things like hunt often"
599,"I'm a student too, but I mostly hunt if the season coincides with my breaks. What do you study?"
599,I am a psychology major but I am also studying environmental studies and the importance of things like recycling
599,Oh wow. That's awesome. What year are you?
599,"I am in second year, how about you?"
599,I'm a year into my master's program
599,"that must be nice , what is your masters in ?"
599,"It's hard work, but I get a stipend for teaching labs for the department. :) So that's cool. I'm an English major both undergrad and MA."
599,Oh that's cool. Where do you study?
599,A four-year nearby where I live. Nothing fancy. :) We aren't known for much! What got you into psychology?
599,I just want to know how the mind works and one day help others
600,I did not know that. I just love the way they look.
600,"I know right, they are incredibly cute and mischeivous "
600,"I bet they're strong, too."
600,"Yeah, they must be"
600,Do you like apes?
600,"They're ok, i believe they are clever"
600,Most of them are. They're very closely related to humans.
600,"Yes, they are indeed... evolution hey!"
600,That's right! It's an interesting thing to see evolution over the centuries.
600,"Definitely. I wonder when we evolved from having less toes like apes, to 5 toes as humans"
600,I'm sure it has something to do with walking all of the time.
600,and balance perhaps? I only have 3 toes on the right foot though
601,"You're are right, I shouldn't be afraid of a great opportunity."
601,That's the spirit! You should listen to music to help you relax. 
601,"Yes, my after school activities help. I love the band I am in"
601,That is great! I am in a band too in which I write songs for
601,"That's cool, at my school we play all types of songs"
601,Do you play any instruments? I've taken music lessons since I was 5
601,"I play trumpet and baritone, one day I would love to learn guitar.  "
601,I am sure you will get there. I must say guitar is my favourite instrument. You will pick it up easily! 
601,That's what my bandmates say.
601,What is your favourite Genre of music? Mine is indie pop
601,"I like late 90s, but in school we play jazz and classical music"
601,oh that is cool! Jazz is so beautiful and soothing
602,So when was the diagnosis made?
602,Last year
602,And what treatment was suggested? Or did they suggest any specific treatment?
602,"Radiotherapy. I also turned very clean, for instance I am now a vegetarian"
602,So have you researched any of the CBD treatments that are available? I have heard great things about the CBD oils 
602,"I haven't actually, what have you heard?"
602,"Some people have had amazing results using CBD. Tumors shrink, disappear. Others have had no success at all. I guess it all depends on the person."
602,Perhaps I should go ahead and try it!
602,"From what I have read and heard about it, my opinion is that it can't hurt. If it helps that's a bonus"
602,"I will lok into buying some, thank you for the advice"
602,You are welcome. There are so many different types of cancer that if a person can find something that will help them it's a blessing.
602,"Yes, you're right. Have you had any other friends with cancer?"
603,Yeah...I made her a cup of tea before telling her...honey maybe you should drink this lol...
603,Lol I hear it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission.
603,yep and hopefully know some dirty secret about the other person to guilt them out of being angry lol.
603,It's tough to hold in secrets.
603,Yeah I just spit it out...otherwise it just festers you know. Like a silent subtext. An invisible wall that's always there but never talked about.
603,"People say they want the truth, but they usually freak out whenever they get it."
603,Yeah us humans are remarkably indecisive about what we want. Half the times what we think we do we actually don't.
603,Most of use are scared to look inside our own minds and try to better ourselves.
603,Nope and that's one of the reasons people settle for partners that are less than ideal. That way you aren't challenged.
603,I completely agree. We turn into zombies.
603,"I like watching zombie movies, but being one isn't much fun."
603,Zombie movies are my favorite!
604,Me too!!!! Now listening to music. Do you listen to music?
604,"No, I don't listen to too much music. I watch TV. I like Supernatural."
604,Ahh Kesha is my favorite singer.i love supernatural they seem to rule the world.
604,That's pretty cool!  See her in concert any?  
604,"No I haven't,been wanting too.my friend James secretly rules the world but it a secret."
604,Don't let the secret slip! LOL.  
604,It's locked down tight. Lol.
604,Sometimes it's nice to have friends like that!
604,Yes. He is a very dear friend to me. You have any close friends?
604,"Ha, I've double trouble in my kids, and not much time to keep in touch with friends these days"
604,I understand that I have kids myself.they can be a handful at times
604,"Yeah, kids will be kids. no matter where they live! "
605,yeah but I love him like my own. His real mother doesn't have much to do with him.
605,oh ok . that makes more sense now .
605," It gets a little awkward and painful sometimes. When you get that whole ""you're not my mother"" routine."
605,It definitely can be. I'm sure he knows you love him though.
605,Yeah he's just at that rebellious young teenager phase where he's figuring things out. Adults are the enemy. Fight the power!
605,All when can do is be there for them when they need us. 
605,Yeah and he always comes to me eventually or apologizes after doing something hurtful. He's a good kid.
605,He really is a good kid. 
605,*holds up glass of water in a toast* To good kids!
605,To good kids!
605,Cheers! *clinks glasses*
605,Clink clink! I think i'll need two glasses though.
606,Really well! My theme was meat in everyday life.
606,Did you do traditional or modern style? Local show?
606,"Oh, very modern. Yes, it was a local show, but I'd like to take it further if I can."
606,I enjoy going to exhibits maybe I'll run across it!  I personally barely have time to read these days much less art
606,"I know, right? What do you like to read?"
606,"Mystery novels when I get the chance, what about you?"
606,"Cookbooks, usually. I loved Charcuterie: The Craft of Salting, Smoking, and Curing."
606,Wow! you must be a great cook then! 
606,Mostly I like to eat!
606,what kind of food do you like?
606,"Meat. Any kind of meat. I like to eat real hamburgers, with two thick slices of ham instead of buns. I make a turducken every Thanksgiving."
606,Wow that sounds fancy!  Is it hard to cook?
607,I am going to get outside and do some bicycling and watch some football on TV.  What are you going to do?
607,That sounds awesome. I think i will head out on a hike and do a bit of running as I sit in an office all week. 
607,"Good plan.  I like to read fiction, so I'll do some reading too.  "
607, i can never stay still enough to read! i do prefer the outdoors more. Do you have any other hobbies?
607,"I mostly do a lot of outdoors stuff like biking, hiking, kayaking, backpacking.  Do you have any hobbies?"
608,That sounds interesting. 
608,"It is nice place to visit, the people are friendly"
608,That is good. It is always nice to visit a place that has friendly people
608,I try to only travel to places where the citizens are nice to visitors
608,"I do too, especially when traveling with my brother.  "
608,I travel with my daughters whenever I can.
608,"That's sweet! I travel alone mostly, my family is kinda crazy. "
608,"I am fortunate my daughters and I get along, they make great companions."
608,"I get along with my family, but sometimes they have weird thoughts. My brother mainly, he thinks he is a viking."
608,"My extended family can drive me crazy, but I do my best to avoid them"
608,I totally understand that! I try to keep myself busy to avoid them.
608,"It can be tough when we meet for holidays, but laughter helps."
608,"All family get togethers are tough, yes! lol The last one I kept myself busy hiding in my room, painting my nails green."
609,It's a calculus exam. Thanks!
609,Calculus 1?
609,Yup. It is for my degree program.
609,What is your degree? Do you have to get more math classes after this?
609,"My degree is engineering. Yes, I will also have to take physics."
609,Physics? That must be crazy hard.
609,Yeah it is. My brother said that only about half the class passed when he took it. 
609,"My mother teaches it at the high school level, but I guess I didn't get the math genes in the family."
609,That's ok. I bet your great at a ton of other things.
609,"Ah, thanks. Mostly I just like to mountain bike."
609,Thats so cool! Have you biked in any cool places?
609,There are some great trails in the Appalachians.
610,Is it enjoyable?
610,So far. The biggest issue is when other people don't read the book and you're just uh...well I guess there's nothing to discuss.
610,Indeed. I enjoy going out to bars. Alcohol helps finding things to discuss.
610,It does. And makes me braver. I usually look for that hot nerd type to chat up.
610,Someone should start an alcohol club.
610,Or bring it to our book clubs...the hard stuff...liven the conversations.
610,What a great idea.
610,Okay I'm going to bring a giant bottle of vodka to the next one. We're discussing Dostoevsky so it's perfect.
610,What's your favorite Dostoevsky?
610,Only read a couple so far. I loved Crime and Punishment.
610,I haven't read anything of his.
610,"Well it's a good one to start on. A great, psychological book. What goes on in the human mind."
611,My St.Bernard will be carrying the ring in a tiny little beer barrel attached to his collar.
611,"Yes great idea what kind of dog is he, I had a dog growing up I loved Buddy he was a greater swiss mountain dog."
611,I believe we are talking about the same breed of dog. They were a rescue dog designed for high altitudes.
611,I wonder how many movies they have made about these rescue dogs.
611,"When we honeymoon at Niagra, it may be useful to have both: old movies and a rescue dog. Will you attend the wedding?"
611,I would love to attend the wedding. I can attend any time thanks to my schedule.
611,"Open schedules are magnificent, yes?  I got so bored that I decided to marry just to fill the time."
611,That's the pleasure of working from home. Maybe I'll make a movie out of your wedding!
611,"As long as my role is played by Rip Taylor, I don't think that'll be a problem."
611,"It's your wedding, after all. Whatever role you want."
611,You're absolutely right! Perhaps I will be my own ring bearer as well. That way I can walk down the aisle twice. 
611,"got it , cat glasses , frumpy dresses , and whatever is your drink of choice ."
612,"No, but I had already left the store and I figured ""why bother?"""
612,That makes a lot of sense. Sometime that's just how it goes though.
612,"Yeah, I mean, the cashier has a bit of leeway. Don't they?"
612,Sometimes. I suppose it depends on the store policies. 
612,"Well, like I said- I'm not proud of continuing on my way. I should have returned to the store."
612,You still can if you it's something that's still bothering you.
612,I wouldn't dare. I'd be so humiliated if anyone else knew!
612,"It's not something to be embarrassed about. It happens all the time, and may clear the name of the cashier. It may also make you feel better about it. "
612,You may be right.
612,Just do what you feel would be best. 
612,I'm sure I'll feel better after my wine.
612,Maybe. What is your favorite kind of wine?
613,"In my current relationship, there is more trust she's not insecure about me going out with friends"
613,That is great!! It sounds like it is a good relationship.
614,Britney and Christina are no longer those wholesome teenagers lol.
614,do they ever play justin timberlike ? i love justin timberlike !
614,He doesn't put out a lot of new music anymore. Kinda depressing.
614,"Yeah.i likes his music, but now I don't have a lot of time to listen to music college pretty much takes all my time."
614,Just as well since there's not much new music to listen to. What are you taking?
615,"Honestly, I do. I get to make my own schedule and name my price."
615,That's always nice! I wish I could do that! I work at a movie theater so I have set hours.  
615,Maybe you can start doing some work on the side. Do you have any special skills?
615,"I am a very organized person, and have good computer skills. "
615,That's good. There are some online jobs that you can do in your free time.
615,"I would like to do more work in the morning, I'm always busy at night. I work and do my running at night."
615,I'm sure a little extra money in the morning would give you a good start to the day.
615,"haha, yes it would!"
615,I say you look into it. I'm sure you can find something enjoyable.
615,I would probably love to some freelance 
615,It's definitely a great way to flex the mind. Make it happen!!
615,I am always bad at not making it happen though. lol 
616,"I was watching Bob Ross, my favorite artist, paint a tree on television last night. The tree looked exactly like the one I landed in."
616,"That's hilarious. I love Bob Ross, he's got such cool hair. "
616,"That means I have cool hair also, since I emulate obscure celebrities in every facet of my life."
616,That's interesting. How could you emulate every celebrity? Wouldn't that be somewhat of a paradox? OR is it only the ones you like?
616,Only the obscure ones. My mothers fashion line does something similar. I wish she would let me model her new line of Congressional Hairnets.
616,hahaha. Congressional Hairnets. I guess I could use one of those since I plan to become a nun. 
616,Goodness gracious! Why would you want to do that? or is it Nun of my business?
616,Why? What's wrong with becoming a nun? They seem pretty chill at my high school. 
616,"Oh I forgot that nuns worked in public. I keep thinking of them as isolationists, much like we do of monks.\"
616,"That makes sense. Some monks go out in public, but most don't work. Have you ever heard of phenomenology? "
616,"No, but I assume it's the study of phenomenons. How off base am I?"
616,They do! But mostly the phenomena of consciousness. It's interesting stuff.
616,"Oh, I don't need to study consciousness. I already know all there is about existence. Any questions?"
616,"Wow, I don't think I'll ever be that certain about my own existence. "
616,That is correct. You never will until we all are.
617,No I'm so glad I didn't tho.my dog sure wanted it.lol
617,Yeah doggy dinner...YUM!
617,Yeah he was huge.then I went back to watching my comics. Lol
617,Yeah seen one skunk you've seen them all I guess.
617,Lol.yup they are all smelly. Do you watch much TV?
617,Not like I used to. The last few years all the good viewing stuff is on internet streaming.
617,Yeah.i love Netflix and Hulu. I'm a huge couch potato. Im very picky on what I watch tho.
617,I don't care where I find it as long as it's good. I love me some YouTube because it's short and there's so much variety.
617,My daughter loves YouTube.i only listen to music on YouTube
617,Music is like the only thing I don't listen to online. Still like my radio for that. 
617,Lol.thats how you get to know all the new music on the radio.
617,True enough I suppose. I'm old fashioned about some things.
618,"Yeah, I had some great friends that passed away in law school."
618,"I'm sorry to hear that. If you don't mind me asking, how did your friends pass away?"
618,They went ice fishing. Fell througn and drowned.
618,"That's unfortunate, but at least they were doing what they loved!"
618,"Actually, they didn't want to go. It was an instructor that took them as TA's on a research expedition."
618,Did the instructor face any consequences afterward? That seems reckless.
618,"No, not at all. It wasn't like that. Just a freak accident. Very unfortunate."
618,"What's done is done, I suppose. I hope I didn't open any old wounds."
618,"No, I'm good, man. I should hold up."
618,Glad to hear it. 
618,I'm sure you are!
618,"So, what are you up to these days?"
619,"Oh, well I wouldn't know."
619,I like Batman because he's a regular human. He doesn't have super powers.
619,"He just has gadgets, right?"
619,Right. And he always conveniently has the right gadget for whatever crime he's solving.
619,"What about Robin? Did he have to borrow all his gear from Batman? Kind of awkward, huh?"
619,Lol I don't know how that was started. I'm sure Batman bought whatever Robin needed.
619,I can only imagine!
619,Who's your favorite hero?
619,"I'm without the illusion of heroes, my friend."
619,Aww man you gotta have a little imagination with that stuff.
619,"Not really. I did try to like them. Bought  a Venom, but never got into it."
619,"Venom is a good one. He's an anti-hero, and that's a special niche in the comic market."
620,That's interesting. I've done some research but it seems difficult to actually get the viewers. 
620,S.E.O. (Seardh engine optimization) companies can help you get hits on youtube also. But they cost money to be effective.
620,"I used to work for an SEO company, actually. Most people don't even know that term if you bring it up to random people. haha"
620,It IS refreshing that there are still people who haven't spent that much time online. 
620,"haha. The internet is the future, I guess. Youtube is an especially interesting place. You can learn just about anything. "
620,"Yes, I've learned that the earth is round, flat, and shaped like a donut all at once. I learned all of this on youtube."
620,"I guess critical thinking skills are still an important trait to have while doing just about anything, but especially when it comes to the internet. "
620,"When I'm shopping, which I love to do, I use critical thinking to decide where to eat. Optimal outcome is always the same: Fries at the golden arches."
620,"It seems to me that actual critical thinking skills consider a bit more than preference or taste. I guess it depends on your objective, though. "
620,Ones objective should always be personal satisfaction.
620,"Maybe, but I think hedonism eventually creates chaos. "
620,It's fortunate that most of us are satisfied personally when we help others.
621,All the stop and go traffic and hills are killing my transmission
621,"Well, that's wear and tear. You're not to blame."
621,I'm sure my car disagrees since I chose to live in the Bay area...she's like coulda learned to drive better!
621,My car wouldn't end up like that down here in the valley.
621,"Ever wonder if cars could talk, I mean we baby them like they're real.  Mine has a name! "
621,I've never named a car.
621,My sister thinks I'm nuts bc I have lol.  
621,"Yeah, my family never really got that materialistic for those kinds of bad habits to rub off on me."
621,"oh, truth, family customs and all.  "
621,For sure.
621,whats something you learned from your fam
621,Don't talk to strangers. 
622,Hersery Pennsylvania.The chocolate capital of the USA.
622,MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM love me those Hershey kisses.
622,Oh yes. So good  I don't travel much. College and my dogs takes up pretty much all my time.
622,Oh what kind of dogs and what are you taking?
622,"A pit,a blue heeler I love my dogs more than anything they are super spoiled. English,and child phycology I'm wanting to be a teacher "
622,Blue heelers are gorgeous. English teacher was my second choice.
622,That's cool. English was a favorite subject in school.yeah my blue heeler is a females and a smart dog.
622,Pitbulls also get a bad wrap. Just because they're big and strong and capable of doing a lot of damage. But it's never a case of bad dog.
622,"Nope.mine is a big baby, he runs from my cat. Lol"
622,My friend owned a rottweiler who would hide under the bed every time a new visitor came over.
622,Oh wow. Yeah it's usually the big dogs that are the sweetest.
622,Almost always. Big affectionate lugs.
623,"Yes, you don't see many males with long hair.  Especially past the shoulders!"
623,"I understand that, attitudes about hair varies across cultures and historical periods, and age too"
623,"Definitely.  Since having kids, it seems like the 'mom' thing to do is cut your hair.  Not me I guess."
623,I never met my mother. I wonder if she would have cut her hair or kept it long.
623,"Wow, it must have been difficult for you not knowing your mother.  Even the simple things like not knowing what she looked like must have been tough."
623,"Yes it was, that is why I have dedicated my life and study to finding out what happened to her and my father."
623,That sounds like an interesting journey.  I'm sure it's frustrating sometimes.  Do you think you are close to finding out?
623,"Well. The US government won't say anything, but I have come across some interesting leads in a small Russian newspaper, which lead my investigation to a library in Kabul."
623,Wow!  Dealing with different countries would definitely add a degree of difficulty.  Is it strange the US government won't (or can't) say anything?  That sounds very odd
623,"It is odd! That is why I suspect that they were operatives with the CIA. But why they never came back from their last mission, I have not yet discovered."
623,Crazy! It sounds like a movie or TV show or video game! It would be frustrating not knowing what happened but kind of cool you have such interesting parents
623,"Maybe I will publish a book if I am able to piece together the full story. Anonymously, of course. The government does not give up its secrets easily!"
624,"That *does* sound exhausting, so I can't blame you."
624,I fall asleep at times. It's a thing.
624,You may want to get a sleep study done to see if you're narcoleptic.
624,You think so?!
624,"With your work load, it may not be, but if you find yourself becoming tired at odd times, it might be the right call."
624,Maybe I just need to cut back on the tennis.
624,That kind of physical activity can make it much harder to keep your energy up when doing something relaxing like reading. 
624,"You don't have to tell me, buddy!"
624,"When it comes time for me to write after a long day, it's hard to focus on the task at hand."
624,Watching fish can be relaxing. It could put you in the zone.
624,"I've never really been interested in fishing, but maybe I could give it another try."
624,"No, I mean in an aquarium."
625,"Ok, I guess that was a bit out of nowhere!"
625,Lol...I'm a bit of a trivia geek.
625,"Well, trivia and sewing go hand in hand..."
625,"yeah tea, knitting needles and inane knowledge. A Holy Trinity."
625,"lol, that's the one!"
625,Every Sunday I pray to Sister Martha of the knitting needle lol...my Patron Saint.
626,"I see, that's interesting. It's good that those things exist for people who need it. "
626,I know a woman who was actually paid 6 dollars per month to live in an apartment. That's free rent and one pack of cigarettes.
626,"I guess so. Better than having someone homeless on the streets, especially compared to the amount of money we give billionaires for free. "
626,"True. If that guy that invented Tesla cars would give up half a billion, it'd help quite a bit. "
626,Sure. Do you think it's weird how much of most people's income goes to paying rent?
626,"I find renting as strange as typing with both hands. I type with one, and am starting to believe perhaps I'm in the minority on both accounts."
626,I think you might be right about that. Can you type fast when typing with only one hand?
626,20 words per minute if it's not too cold in the office. 30 words per minute if my blood is warm. Summer is the superior season.
626,20 wpm? That's pretty slow. Have you ever thought about learning to type with both hands online?
626,"Oh, I can do that, but then I'd have to set down my coffee. And without the coffee I'd be typing with my face."
626,"Or you could create some type of instrument, that is constantly feeding you coffee while you type with two hands. "
626,I did: my daughter. But she's still to young to hold the cup steady.
627,Hmm... I've never heard of that distinction.
627,"Yeah, people don't usually look too kindly on people who like to stay up all night."
627,I've always been a night owl.
627,A kindred spirit?! How do you spend your nights?
627,Chores mostly. Nothing exciting.
627,"My wife like to clean at night, but I usually write for work."
627,I was just joking- I party hard in the Atlanta clubs baby!! woo-hoo!!!
627,"I'm not much parties, myself. We live a quiet life for the most part. How's the part scene?"
627,"Man, it's so wild. People dying like flies out here we go so hard!"
627,Why are people dying like flies? What's going on?
627,Overdoses. There's a batch of bad meth going around in my city. It's tragic.
627,That's awful. Truly a shame.
628,I went in to pick up my order and someone had already taken it
628,That's preposterous. A real crime. Did you tell the baristas what happened?
628,I did.  they gave me another on.  I love Starbucks...almost as much as I love Burritos!
628,"Burritos and Starbucks don't sound like they go together very well, so I hope these were different meals. What's your drink order?"
628,lol  I know.  I was picking up for later.  I just like cappuccino
628,"Interesting. I think that could be made into a movie. It's got everything. Love, loss, and the inevitable hopelessness of being. "
628,thats me.  my life is a drama!
628,Interesting. So what's your favorite movie?
628,action and suspense.  I really like the hunt for red October.  I watched it again last week
628,Wow! I have a ton of movies but haven't seen that one. What's it about?
628,stealing a russian submarine.  Its a jack ryan movie.  The first one I think
628,"Oh, interesting. I've never seen it myself, but I would be interested in checking it out sometime. "
629,"I find them quite long, but once I got a bit of coffee into me it was easier to pay attention and get into it. Very talented musician."
629,"Well, I love live music! It's best with bacon and jello. maybe."
629,Bacon is always a good way to start things!  I can't wait for the weekend and make some bacon and eggs for breakfast.  
629,Right! I love eggs too!
629,What's your favourite way to make them?  I love sunny side up and scrambled sometimes
629,"Tacos, man."
629,"That sounds kind of weird!  But in Italy once, I saw pizza with a sunny side up egg right in the middle of it so who knows!"
629,You've never had an egg taco?!
629,"I haven't, no!  Is it just a regular taco with egg in it?  How is the egg cooked?  Like scrambled before putting it in the taco?"
629,"Yeah, just a scrambled egg and tortilla."
629,I'll have to try that some time.  Sounds like a good snack for when I'm working (I draw professionally)
629,"Wow, do you draw skaters and weirdo-people like me?"
629,I'm a cartoonist so I absolutely draw weirdos!  Especially like you!
630,would you like a pastry as thanks?
630,I thought I informed you that you couldn't handle any food due to risk of cross contimination. This is serious.
630,"I suppose you are right, I just have such a passion for baked goods, cake is a big part of my life"
630,"Well, now that all needs to change. Are you hungry in your mouth or stomach? Stay focused on your weight."
630,"Good point. I may have to distract myself with other things, what do you think "
630,I think that is exactly what you need.
630,"Luckily, I happen to be somewhat of a collector. I have an extensive collection of small toys wearing little raincoats. Do you collect anything?"
630,no.
630,"what would you use to distract youself then, if you were in my position?"
630,I think you should find an app or reader that you could use instead. 
630,"Great idea, I love reading recipe books, maybe I could do that on an e-reader. Thanks."
630,You're welcome. I'm just glad we could stop this from getting out of hand.
631,I can understand that. Nothing really ever is perfect. Must be a lot of effort.
631,Trying to save the world must be hard. I may work too much but not enough when it comes to conservation.
631,Me either. I take out the garbage and try not to litter. That's about the extent of my fabulous contributions to the cause.
631,"If you search youtube for ""melody sheep""   ""bill nye"" you will see a most wonderful video. Watching things like this is the extent of my contribution."
631,lol it's more than me.
631,"Yeah, i need a vacation from all my work. I should use the vacation to do some charity..."
631,I suppose if you want to. But it could be the whole OCD thing. Maybe you're being a bit hard on yourself.
631,Obsessing compulsively about my disorders is rather exhausting. How have you been feeling the last few days/
631,Not too bad...The weather has gotten super cold though. Not a big fan of forced hibernation.
631,"We should carve stone monuments so that when we freeze to death, the next dominant species can learn about us in the future."
631,Good plan. What do you want them to know about you?
631,"Very little. Perhaps that while the world was on fire, and I yet froze to death, I never forgot the alamo."
632,"That's the way it goes, or the original is good and later ones are lackluster. Consistent quality is hard to come by."
632,very true. The end of Game of Thrones gutted my sensibilities for expecting quality to be consistent. 
632,"Game of Thrones is the perfect example. It was one of the best things on TV for awhile, then it became trash."
632,I absolutely agree. Hopefully the directors are ashamed of what they created. They ruined a perfectly great series.
632,I don't think rich people are capable of shame.
632,"I definitely agree. If they were, there wouldn't be billionaires. "
632,It takes a certain underhandedness to get to the top.
632,Absolutely. And cognitive dissonance to ignore the exploitation of the working class. 
632,What can you do? All I know to do is binge watch videos to get through the day.
632,"It makes sense. As they say, netflix is the opiate of the masses. Or did I get that quote wrong?"
632,Seems legit.
632,"Unfortunately, even the shows can betray you. I need a good steak. Do you think they have some in Canada?"
633,Oh! You're going to an interview too? I just moved here and this interview is super important to me.
633,I'm really excited to interview for this job.  I hope I get it!
633,"Well that's certainly something i can relate to, i'm pretty nervous but I think I've got this. How do you prepare for an interview?"
633,Well I eat a well balanced meal the night before and exercise in the morning
633,"Sounds smart, I like to put on some music beforehand to get me into the zone myself."
633,Thats a good idea too.  I may try that.  I list to music when I rollerblade
633,"Oh, cool, what sort of stuff do you listen to, i'm a big fan of Jason Mraz myself/"
633,"classic rock for the win!  Van Halen, Bon Jovi, etc"
633,"Can't argue with the classics, nothing like a 80s power ballad when out on a run or at the gym"
633,yesss!  love the power ballads too.  timeless!
633,"Well, good luck with your interview, it's been nice chatting to you"
633,thanks!  good luck with your interview too.  I hope you get it
634,An ancient king named David wrote that we should dance and make a joyful noise. 
634,What kind of noise is that?
634,"If my spelling is correct, I think it's like ""woo-hoo!"" or as the kids say: ""wooot"""
634,Can you imagine walking to work one day and you see someone dancing and saying woot? What would you do?
634,I'd try to steal their winning lottery ticket.
634,What would you do with the money? 
634,"I'd build a church. I'm not particularly religeous, but I do enjoy watching a group in prayer together. Strange?"
634,Yes. I'd buy office supplies.
634,There's an OfficeMax across the way from the gym I work out in while listening to christian edm. Do you collect office suppllies?
634,I like owning the really nice stuff. Stupid expensive pens are my specialty.
634,You better stay away from my collection of vintage parchment. The temptation must be too much...
634,I will see to your vintage parchment. And it will be mine.
635,"I have a slight southern United States accent, but I can't hear it compared to the people around me."
635,My accent is quite thick still.  Some big words are quite difficult for me.
635,"Your English seems pretty strong, though. Excellent work. English is supposedly pretty hard for non native speakers to learn."
635,Thank you it indeed was a bit of a challenge.  Do you have any pets?
635,I have a dog. He's a Siberian husky. What about you?
635,I have a dog also.  His name is Wonwon.  He is a german shepard.
635,"My dog's name is Kubrick, after the director."
635,that is awesome ! what movies did he direct ?
635,"The Shining is one of the most well known. It has a sequel coming out, apparently? My favorites are 2001 and A Clockwork Orange, though."
635,The Shining is a great movie for sure!
635,What is your favorite movie?
635,napoleon dynamite . what is yours ?
635,Probably Princess Mononoke.
635,"that is a very good movie . i , personally , love disney movies ."
636,thats right!  money is the best gift.  I need it for the kids!
636,"Makes sense, I don't have any myself so my money goes towards skiing gear mostly. How many kids do you have?"
636,I have 4.  so we have our hands full!
636,"I can imagine, are they getting anything special with the money or are you going to spend it more on day to day stuff?"
636,"mostly day to day stuff....but we just got a cat, so cats toys are in the future"
636,Lucky them! I'm allergic to cats so the closest I come to them is the cheetah on the side of my Cheetos packets.
636,haha  thats funny.  my kids love the new kitty and it keeps them busy
636,"I'm sure a bit of relief is a blessing, how old are they?"
636,"My kids are 14, 10, 8 and 2.  two boys and two girls. "
636,"Wow, that's quite the range, it must be pretty hectic"
636,yes....we stay VERY busy.  I love it though
636,"Sounds great, its been nice chatting with you"
637,"I reside in a rather large city, but it's not as progressive as your home. Gamble much?"
637,I do. Every weekend. I like to see if my karma is acting as it should and reevaluate my life accordingly.
637,"My studies indicate that since you are still alive, you are living well."
637,Is that right. What kind of studies?
637,"I majored in american literature and education, but the studies I'm referring to are the works of heroditus and plato."
637,Interesting. I'm more of a Hegel and Marx kinda gal. I'd say Plato might disagree with you a bit on that
637,Catherine Hegel and Groucho Marx?
637,HA. No. I'm a fan of the Georg Wilhelm Hegel's dialectic and Karl Marx's interpretation of that. Heraclitus seems somewhat related. 
637,"No kidding! As a native of Ephesus, you know I love those philosophies."
637,It's very interesting stuff. That's very exciting. Have you visited any of the landmarks?
637,"Only the ones on the west coast. I don't rent any houses, but Ionian."
637,Interesting. What is Ionian?
637,That was a pun.
638,"Here's hoping. It's been tricky to give up vices like burgers, but at least I can still enjoy eggs and cheese."
638,"Yeah, I've been thinking about doing it myself, but I love meat a little bit too much. How did you get into it, was it difficult?"
638,"It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be, but it also wasn't easy. I just had to keep reminding myself why I wanted to make the change."
638,"Was it the blood results that got you into it, or was it more of a moral choice?"
638,"It was more motivated by my health, but the moral element made it easier not to look back."
638,"That's commendable, I'm struggling with the morality at the moment, I write children's books with these black and white morals, it really puts my meat eating into perspective"
638,"Oh, you're a writer? What have you written?"
638,"I mostly focus on children's books, I don't have any myself but its a joy to go to a reading and see their faces light up. Its also super fun."
638,"I imagine it would be. I like to draw people I know, and it would be fun to put that work illustrating a story."
638,"Why not give it a go, I didn't realise how great writing was until I tried it, do you like to draw any other stuff?"
638,I haven't really tried to expand my repertoire yet. I need to get outside of my comfort zone.
638,"Hey, why don't we do a deal, you try some illustrating, and I'll give vegetarianism a go. Let "
639,I really wish he were still around
639,How come? What do you think would change? OR do you just want to hear him in Concert?
639,I would love to hear him in concert.  I never got the chance
639,I see. Me neither. Do you ever go to see concerts?
639,"I try to, but it's hard to work into my schedule with work and family"
639,That makes sense. What kind of music do you usually listen to?
639,I like mostly classic rock and southern rock
639,I see. Whats your favorite band of all time?
639,"If I had to choose, I would say Toto. What about you?"
639,"Interesting. I'm not entirely sure, I'd probably say Bright Eyes because of the lyrics in their later albums."
639,I don't know much about them.  What album would you recommend I start with?
639,"Hmm, it depends on what you're into but Cassadaga is an excellent album. "
639,"Ok, I'll give that a listen.  What other hobbies do you have besides listening to music?"
640,My business has donated to the Humane Society.  I believe it does important work.
640,"Yes, it does. It's an amazing feeling of satisfaction you get by helping people in need, specially innocent animals. "
641,Heavens no. I only work on cars that are older than I am. Do they make a 1981 kia?
641,"Ha, I was just kidding. You must get people asking you to work on their cars all the time."
641,"Certainly do, and as an artist they insist I put my special touch on it."
641,As long as they pay you what you're worth!
641,I work on cars but prefer to hike. I imagine a cobbler prefers to ride. What
641,I like to cook. I love trying new recipes.
641,Yeah? What're we having for dinner tonight? And do you have enough wine for the both of us?
641,Sesame chicken. And sake to go along with it!
641,"For goodness SAKE, I will be there shortly."
641,"Well, come on! I'm tired of eating by myself and having no one to cook for."
641,"As soon as i figure out which shoe goes on which foot, I can depart. So it may be a few hours before I get out the door."
641,Great! I'll keep the chicken warm. 
642,"What do you mean by ""eat healthier""?"
642,You could try and cut down on carbs and drink more water every day!
642,I guess I could try that.  I do like to eat popcorn while I am watching Netflix though!
642,"Oh man, I was watching Netflix way too late last night. Hence why I slept in this morning!"
642,I wish I could have slept in!  But I've always got to be at the family store on Sundays
642,Do you guys sell hair dye at the family store? I have brown hair but I want to try to dye my hair red.
642,"No, my family owns an appliance store.  It's been in the family 3 generations"
642,Oh that is great. It stinks you have to work on Sunday though.
642,"Yeah, thats the trouble with a small family business I guess.  Why do you want to dye your hair?"
642,I am just tired of having brown hair I guess!
642,I understand wanting to make a change!  I've thought a lot about making a career change
642,What new career do you want to go into?
642,I'm not sure.  Just don't love being in the appliance business.
643,I love rocking chairs!
643,"i'll get to cooking, but know that this rocking chair will cost you dearly. As a pro bowler taking time from bowling costs me bigtime."
643,How much would it cost?
643,Only about 8K
643,"Wow 8,000. I'd have to work a lot for that."
643,"Well, they are hand crafted and frankly my father, a retired policeman needs my help. 8K would would do, please help"
643,I am a professional grandmother and also a chicken plucker. I would have to pluck for hours.
643,"Shoot. This is making things hard for me. Umm, need an extra hand with the plunking?"
643,I can trade feathers
643,Are feathers in high demand?
643,Feathers are worth a lot. I can trade 5 bags of feathers and a country music cd.
643,"For the rocking chair? You promise they're worth a lot? Like 8k, so I can help out my dad?"
644,What kind of flower arrangement?
644,"It is an orchid arrangement. You know us vegetarians, we love our plants!"
644,Orchids were the flowers that were at my parents' funeral.
644,Oh man I am sorry to hear that your parents died.
644,"Thank you, you are kind. Are you parents still alive?"
644,They are both alive but I don't talk to my mom anymore because she hates how many old books I read.
644,What kinds of old books do you read?
644,They are mostly books about psychology. And flowers.
644,What an interesting combination!
644,What is your favorite flower?
644,Sunflowers
644,T
645,"I like doing solitary stuff, reading, listerning to music, etc."
645,That's interesting! What's your favorite book?
645,"I've been enjoying a lot of stuff recently, I like Lord of the Rings though"
645,"Oh that's interesting. I've heard Tolkein is amazing at world building. I'm not much for fantasy, generally, though."
645,"Yeah, I can understand that, A lot of people don't like the floury language from Tolkein, but the world is amazing. What do you read?"
645,"I like the flowery language, though. I've been enjoying the magical realism of Haruki Murakami lately "
645,I'm afraid I've never heard of them. What sort of stories do they write?
645,"Weird magical realism things. There's a talking cat, so I'm not so sure it's that different than fantasy now that I think about it. "
645,"If you enjoy a book, who cares about the genre in my opinion. What book would you recommend to start with from Murakami"
645,"Kafka On The Shore is one I really liked. It's all translated from Japanese, but it's a really good book. "
645,"I'll be sure to check it out, thanks."
645,"That's great! I've only ever read one book from Stephen King, it was called Lisey's Story and it was super good. I've heard he's a really enjoyable writer as well."
645,"I've heard the quality of his books varies quite a lot, but there are some gems in there. Its been nice talking to you, thanks for the recommendation."
646,"My favorite color is blue.  Specifically, Carolina blue"
646,What is Carolina blue? Is Carolina blue a color associated with a sports team?
646,It is the official color of the University of North Carolina Tar Heels.  It is a light blue
647,"And, what's good about this is that we will go find some bugs together! I love Fireflies!"
647,"Fireflies are pretty spectacular, and it's refreshing to see someone with a nature focused hobby these days."
647,I catch bugs for my collections. It has now become a set of 150! 
647,"That's impressive! I keep myself busy at the gym, but I'm still cooped up inside all the time."
647,That's good to hear. Very few people put efforts towards their health. Did you hire a personal trainer?
647,"No, I actually get a lot of workout tips from YouTube. You have to take the information with a grain of salt, but there's a lot to be learned there."
647,"That must save you lot of money from private training sessions. Talking about money, would you be interested in my collection?"
647,Buying your collection? It would make some interesting and storied decor...
647,Of course! Just let me know if you want any butterfly in particular. The pink one I caught yesterday is the biggest of them all! Costed me an accident.
647,"What kind of accident? Nothing too serious, I hope?"
647,I broke a few jars while moving this giant one on the shelf. A small cut but I can handle it. More sad about the broken jars.
647,"Unfortunate, but wounds heal. And, you can replace jars! "
648,I am at parties I guess.  Just not with my family
648,"I love to try new foods, so I like going to parties where the host is a good cook"
648,I love food.  I worked as a cook for a little while.  Just didn't work out though...
648,"It is a good skill to have! I have a few recipes I consider my ""specialties"""
648,"What is your favorite ""specialty"" to cook?"
648,I make a really good shrimp scampi pizza
648,I used to wait tables at a pizza place.  We didn't have anything that fancy though
648,I would want to eat all of the pizza if I worked there. Thankfully I don't work in the food industry
648,I've worked in a kinds of restaurants.  I just can't seem to stay at any very long
648,"I am sorry to hear that. I've learned from my parents that patience is a virtue, but difficult to maintain"
648,"Yeah, I'm not very patient.  One of my many faults I guess..."
648,Buddhism has a lot of great teachings on patience
649,"That's pretty near. I should get my own masters, but in law. I want to fight evil"
649,A masters in law sounds difficult.
649,"It probably is, but I just went through the worst breakup! I can handle anything, right?"
649,"Well, the course load would certainly take your mind off things!"
649,"Oh, that is a very good point! Now, to get a loan...Have you found work in your field already?"
649,That's the good thing about a business masters - it can be used in almost any field.
649,"I can imagine, do you have any preference? Please don't work for some giant evil corporation."
649,"No way. I have ethics and morals. I prefer corporations with a ""soul."""
649,"Phew, I'm so happy to hear that. I have you land a job in your field soon!"
649,"Me, too, although once I'm working I won't be able to travel much."
649,"That is a bummer for sure, but you'll get time off from time to time! Where will you travel?"
649,"Somewhere far away like Japan, but I like to keep my stay short because I get homesick sometimes."
650,"Yeah, I'm not a fan of hot weather."
650,Same. It's too hot here.
650,Autumn can't come soon enough! I especially can't wait for Halloween.
650,Halloween is definitely my favorite. I love to dress my cat up.
650,My dog would literally never allow me to dress him. He's a maverick!
650,"I'm sorry, that really stinks. It's so fun dressing up animals. What do you try to dress him up as?"
650,"Never costumes, because he went crazy when I tried to put a sweater on him. Don't be sorry. It's very funny and just part of his character."
650,"I understand! I dress Mater up as characters from Cars. It's my favorite movie, has been since I was a kid."
650,"Is that where the cat's name came from, too?"
650,"Yep! Mater is my second favorite character, and given that the cat looks like Larry the Cable Guy, it kinda fit."
650,"That sounds hilarious. I've never seen Cars, for some reason or another."
650,"Oh, you should. I hated it at first, but my children loved it, and then it grew on me. really good story, honestly. One of Pixar's best."
651,I do but I have a great job and I dont want to lose it and affect my family
651,Sounds like it might be time to sit down with the boss and discuss your thoughts and feelings. If moral gets too low it's not good for anybody.
651,I guess so.  I am just such a upbeat person usually.  I don't like conflict.  
651,"I understand. Conflict can be difficult, but a respectful discussion could be had"
651,I guess that's true.  Maybe I'm reading too much into the situation and we can just have a good laugh about it
651,That is possible! Try to approach it respectfully but almost casually.
651,That's great advice!  Have you ever had to deal with a situation like this?
651,"I have, both at work and at home. I am the oldest of five!"
651,Wow!  I'm an only child.  But my husband has 11 siblings!
651,Wow! That is a lot of siblings
651,It certainly is!  Unfortunately he never gets to see them because of his job
651,"That is difficult. Maybe they can use technology more to keep in touch, video calls and such"
652,I plan on hopefully getting some writing done for a personal project I've put aside - anything to distract myself for a bit with my girlfriend being away
652,"Speaking of projects, I'm tired of of working all day sitting at home. All because of this broken leg of mine!"
652,Ah I'm so sorry to hear that! How did you break your leg?
652,mountain biking accident . its the 2nd time i broke it in the same place .
652,Ouch! I'm not much of an outdoors person myself maybe that's why I haven't broken any bones yet..Any idea how long your recovery is supposed to be?
652,The doc says it gonna take me another 8 weeks for recovery. You can't just stop yourself from going out when you experience enough thrill!
652,"Aw thats a long time I'm sorry, but hopefully you're getting some well deserved rest now. Is your job flexible with you working from home?"
653,"Yeah, I hope so. This week has gone on too long already."
653,"i understand that feeling well . i usually try to distract myself with some other activity , like recycling ."
653,"Yeah. I crochet from time to time, but it's hard to find the time anymore sadly. "
653,"Crocheting is fun.  The name derives from French.  My sister enjoys doing it, what else takes up your time or just that"
653,"Mostly it's just that. I have to work a lot during the week, and am even on call too, depending."
653,Do you find it difficult doing stuff early a times?
653,"Yeah. I sleep whenever I can, since I could be woken up at any time of the night, so I usually don't get up early."
653,Do you think you'll have trouble getting up early when you find a new job? Back to regular wake times and all?
653,"It'll be weird adjusting if I get a new job, but I do think it'd be better in the long run. Less stress, less depression for sure."
653,"you know, some stress can be healthy and good for you. how u dealing with the depression?"
653,"Yeah, but it's super stressful when planning funerals... For depression, I mainly use therapy. have to, in this line of work"
653,do you ever feel like therapy doesn't do anything ?like idk sometimes i wonder if it really helps
653,"It definitely has helped me cope with my job, which is good. Otherwise, I'd've burnt out a long time ago."
654,"I prefer night over day time because its real quiet inside the home & no sounds of any kind. very relaxing, and you?"
654,"Same, I feel I get my best work done in the night, the lack of distractions really helps me focus."
654,"same here, I seem to focus better and think better as well, its when I get most of my work done."
654,"My family is back in the states, so there is no reason for me to be and about during the day. It helps with timezones too"
654,I sometimes stay up late just to talk with a sister from California. No distractions.
654,"Yeah, if they are also a night owl or they are in a different timezone you can get some really great conversations in at night"
654,"Very true, and yes my sister is a night owl as well. we talk for hours, and its so quiet."
654,"Yeah, does you job accommodate your night owling? I'm lucky mine does"
654,"Well it was very nice chatting, have a great evening from one night owl to another :)"
654,"Fun indeed, enjoy!"
654,w
654,Good night!
655,Not really.  We were when I was younger.  I just don't know how she'll feel about my dogs
655,"Why did you two grow apart? I bet she will like your dogs. I mean c'mon, who doesn't love dogs?!"
655,Life just gets crazy I guess.  My dad's whole side of the family grew apart over the years
655,"Ah, life does get crazy. My family only gets together around the holidays."
655,At least you get to see them occasionally!  Do you all have any special traditions?
655,"That is truth! This year will be quite hard, though. My father was killed in a shootout, he was a cop. It won't be the same."
655,"Oh my gosh!  I am so sorry to hear that.  Death is always hard to handle, especially around the holidays"
655,"Thank you for you understanding. You are kind. So, does your family not gather at the holidays?"
655,Not really.  Most of them live too far away and can't afford to travel every year
655,That is quite sad. I wish you could see them. I've learned how important it is to cherish family while you have them.
655,That's true.  Maybe I could offer to drive to them this year
655,"If you can afford to do it, I would totally recommend it. It could be an adventure too!"
656,Great! Is there any charge for the towels?
656,"It's a private beach, so I get paid by the owner, and tips."
656,"Awesome, here you go. Any site seeing suggestions? I would love to see the city a little."
656,Definitely check out the private beaches. Theyre the best in the area. 
656,I hope I don't get bored of the beach!
656,"Oh, you definitely won't. You can snorkle, get your divers license, etc. And, if you do, there's still the night clubs. They're world famous"
656,The night club sounds like a perfect way to kick off the night!
656,More like the perfect way to end it! Locals don't start getting there until midnight or later. Usually when all the Americans start to leave.
656,What's the best way to not stand out as an American?
656,"Do what the locals do. Eat dinner at 10ish, go out to the nightclubs later. Don't leave until they close around 4 or 5"
656,I'll have to keep that in mind. I don't usually stay up late but when in Rome right?
656,"In Spain, in this case!"
657,oooo you winning? how many 
657,"Yes, I am winning. Four of us playing, two teams"
657,nicee i never could get the hang of pool my hands sweat like crazy lol but i do love to cook with freinds 
657,That sounds fun. What do you like to cook most
657,honestly curry chicken or califlower but i cooked some quish(idk how to spell) and it was sooo good
657,Sounds really good. I have not tried curry chicken before
657,oh your missing out its so good but getting the chicken to that perfect bone falling off is a bit tricky sometimes btw whats your fav color
657,"I see. My favorite color is probably sparkly white, like a unicorn horn"
657,mines blue but now im thinking of unicorns 
657,I love unicorns!
657,if only they were real sigh
657,Indeed. Horses are the next best thing though
658,"I don't know, meat just stopped doing it for me, I much prefer to each fish these days, I haven't looked back"
658,It really limits your dietary choices.  I don't recommend it.   Have you considered vegetarian?
658,"I've thought about it, and i usually have some veggies with my fish. But I just can't stop eating our scaly friends #"
658,I couldn't disagree with how much they help with our eyes and hair growth. My mom used to tell me to thank fishes for giving me blue eyes haha!
658,"Yeah, my eyesight is great. It could just be placebo, but I feel it's gotten even better since I started eating more fish. "
658,You will get even better with time. Keep eating fish and who knows your eyes can be like mine someday!
658,"I can only hope, do you eat carrots as well. I hear they are good for the eyes, but I don't eat them much myself"
658,"I thought they make you a horse! Just kidding, IMO spinach is better option."
658,"Ah, well I'll give it a go, thanks for the great advice!"
658,"I would suggest buying it straight from a farm rather than stores. It looses its value quickly. Eat fresh, live long my friend!"
658,"Sounds like you know a lot about the subject, I'm a strapped for cash, so sometimes its difficult to get the best quality stuff from stores."
658,Of course! My dad owns a small farm where we have fun with animals and sometimes play basketball with our neighbourhood orphanage.
659,I'm using it to learn English.
659,"That's great. I'm a native spaker, but from what I understand English is very hard to actually learn what was your original language "
659,"Yeah, the spelling of English is odd. I speak French natively."
659,I took French in school too! Totally useless now i mean it does help with spanish but ive pretty much forgot 90% of it .
659,"Well, if you ever need help I can offer it. Why do you want to learn Spanish?"
659,spanish is actually a strong suit of mine but i honestly want to be a author 
659,"oh? Writing in Spanish, or bilingually?"
659,"I only speak English, so I am not a polyglot..someone who can speak sever languages, that would be awesome"
659,"You can definitely do it, I'm sure. Especially if you work more with Google Translate"
659,You should trying using google translate to translate english text to a target language like french.
659,I definitely use it a lot to check things when I'm using English. Most of these messages have been run through to check it even.
659,"thats so smart go you, so why do u want to learn english again "
660,"Wow, that's interesting.  Are you a big fan of trivia?"
660,"Sure, especially if it includes sports. I play football and baseball. It would be my forte."
660,I love sports trivia!  My dad and I used to do it together before he started working so much
660,"Awh, I'm sorry to hear that. Life has a way of getting in the way, huh?"
660,"Yeah, he's an investment banker.  He started working for Stifel a few years ago and they work him into the ground"
660,Wall Street never sleeps. Does he ever get time off?
660,He is supposed to but his requests never get approved.
660,That is terrible! Why won't he try to find a new job?
660,He makes too much money at this job.  He's paying for my college so I guess I can't complain
660,"I understand. Maybe, at least, with such a well-paying job he could afford to eventually take a year off or at least retire early."
660,That would be nice for him.  What do you do for work?
660,"Well, I'm a college football player so I do that, attend school, and enjoy pizza whenever I possibly can. I like pizza a lot"
661,"Oh wow. My grandma is from Denmark, they make a dish similar to meatloaf there, so good"
661,"It's a simple concept, but its difficult to go wrong. Delicious meat veggies and spices. Yum!"
661,"Exactly! Pizza is another favorite food, so many different choices"
661,"Yeah, my kids love pizza, I like to make it myself rather than order it, at least then I can save some money "
661,That is a good idea. I make shrimp scampi pizza and it is so good. Never seen it in a restaurant though
661,"I love scampi, I live in New York so its certainly not traditional to put on pizza around here, I might give it a try. Sounds Delicious!"
661,Try it! The trick is to thicken the sauce that you cook the shrimp in (with flour) and then spread on the dough
661,"Interesting, is it just a normal tomato sauce you cook them in, or is it something else?"
661,"No, just butter and some lemon juice"
661,"Interesting, is this a recipe from your grandmother, or is it something you got from elsewhere? "
661,"My grandmother used to cook shrimp for me and put it on toast, so I adapted it from that"
661,"Sounds lovely, I wish I had some tips that I could give you in return."
661,"No worries, with technology, new recipes are a click away"
661,"For sure, thanks for chatting"
662,How did I not know that?! They're literally my favs
662,"Yeah! I used to listen to them all day after coming back from school. But, I don't go out as much so I prefer movies over songs."
662,I can't stand movies. I totally gush over 1D though. Shame they split.
662,"That was heart breaking. I still miss their union. Hey, what you do in your free time? "
662,I like to ski. Lots of places to ski around here.
662,Lovely! Did you ski or sled? Sledding is a whoooooole different animal there!
662,Just ski. It's really easy to take a weekend and go to my family's cabin near the resorts and use their slopes.
662,"That must be nice! and here I am too tired to go to long vacations. Is it risky though, skeeing?"
662,"no, it's not that risky if you know what you're doing. I've done it since birth...Comes with living here, I guess"
662,"You sure know a lot of things about it then. Have you encounter any bear yet, in the mountains?"
662,"No, sadly. I'd love to see a brown bear though. Might have to go to the cabin during the summer"
662,"If you go to China, you might see them in mountain ranges."
663,tripping in public is always obvious
663,Were you walking and suddenly tripped on something you didn't see my son does that alot
663,my mom and sometimes myself also does that many times taking care of my daughter carefully
663,"at one time i tripped up an entire set of steps, not to careful if u guys keep tripping"
663,tripping is casual no need to worry a lot 
663,yeah good point lol do u by chance happen to collect seashells
663,seashells are precious its good  every adverse effects may sometimes gives good experience valuable life lessons
663,"yeah they do , i surely appreciate all your advice not many people seems to care now days"
663,yet there are many people with love and humanity 
663,"Yea, and some people to! but id say not more than 70%"
663,may be you are  right we shall be in that 70%
663,id hope so but its hard staying that way yanno
663,let us try our level best take care
664,"Yes. I am in the process of making a new movie about Charlie Pride, a country singer"
664,What interests you about their life?
664,"He was one of the first African-American country singers, and was very popular all over the country"
664,I'm really not a fan of country music but that sounds like some interesting history to know
664,"The origins of country music is very interesting, but not everyone likes the sound"
664,Do you also like dancing to country music?
664,"I do! I am not very good at it, but I like it!"
664,"Well, I think its all about having a good time. What else do you like?"
664,"I like to spend time outside, camping or hiking"
664,Me too!  Where is your favorite place to camp or hike?
664,Anywhere in the mountains
664,Have you ever been to the Rocky Mountains?
664,I have! Beautiful
665,I am not.  Tell me more about her
665,"She founded an experimental theatre company, wrote several books and is even in a band!"
665,"Wow, sounds like an interesting woman!  What kind of music do you do it to?"
665,I like all sorts of music. I love jazz and classical music. How about you?
665,I like mostly Christian rap and EDM.  They are great for working out to!
665,"Christian rap sounds interestin, I can't say that I've ever heard it before."
665,Oh really?  It sounds the same as mainstream rap but with more wholesome subject matter
665,Do you enjoy hiking?
665,I do most of my exercising at the gym but I like an occasional hike if the weather is nice
665,I took a trip to Alaska recently just to hike across the glaciers
665,Oh man! I wish I had met you earlier.  One of my apps is for identifying penguins that are nearing extinction
665,I can't remember if Alaska has penguins
666,"Yeah, Ive never found much interest in tennis"
666,Have you ever played?  Or you just don't enjoy watching it?
666,I don't enjoy watching it or playing. I would rather do something more adventurous .
666,"oh ok , well different strokes for different folks.  What kind of adventurous things do you like?"
666,My favorite thing is rock climbing. What are your hobbies?
666,"When I am not playing tennis or working out, I seeing musicals and listening to their soundtracks.  My favorite right now is Hamilton"
666,That sounds interesting. Have you seen Hamilton live yet?
666,"No, it is so hard to get tickets!  Have you?"
666,I have! It was amazing.
666,I'm so jealous!  What is your favorite musical?
666,My favorite is Dear Evan Hanson.
666,"Oh, I have heard nothing but great things about that one!  I'm hoping to go to New York soon to see a few shows"
667,"Green? Sure, although warm colors are my preference."
667,I understand that. I often just find them too...bright for my tastes
667,Softer colors help me relax after a long day. Wearing a navy blue uniform gets boring.
667,Are you allowed to mix colors in your uniform?
667,No! I don't think people would like the rescue squad to rush in wearing mix and match separates! How is your job? Do you get casual Friday?
667,"Most days are casual for us, unless we're playing or doing interviews"
667,What kind of interviews?
667,For the press before/after a game. They can get kinda annoying
667,That sounds exciting! Are you on a team with a mascot?
667,"We've got a team name and a guy who runs around ina  silly suit, but that's it"
667,"Okay. Silly suit? Tell me more... And, have I heard of your team?"
667,Yeah. They're the Marlins. It's kinda stupid the way they dress up imo
667,Ha!
668,Nice i have 2 pitbulls that are actually illegal because i live in canada
668,i have 2 i like clubbing as well dogs are my favourite
669,People take advantage of you when you don't have social skills like me. 
669,Yeah it's like some people unfairly take advantage of another person because of social skills .
669,"That's why I find my work as a distraction from all these involvements. I like creating music, that's what I'm best at. "
669,What kind of music do you like?i work in a factory so my music is machine niose 
669,Haha! I like to make slow pace music with some random movie dialogues that makes it sound cool for some reason.
669,sounds very cool id love to go listen someday sounds a bit like lofi i heard about it when i traveled to NY i enjoy traveling alot
669,"Yeah! you got it right. That music can boost your productivity, unless you're like me. I can't find any other work interesting."
669,i like to listen to the best music thats why i like listening to frank sinatra. he was really popular
669,"Sorry, but only 'Sinatra' I've heard of is Tank Sinatra, that guy makes some good memes."
669,lmao im gonna google that later how dank are the memes
669,Yeah! looking at those memes instead of being productive is what I'm best at smh
669,if only u could make music memes
669,Nice suggestion! I'll make one on lofi hip hops then
670,oh. it must be an American thing?
670,Yep! I'm glad I did my best at grades. Maybe now my father will be proud of me.
670,He's not usually?
670,It's not like that. He's a busy man. Always have some kind of work at hand. We see each other for a Hi or Hello
670,"Ah, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any pets to make up for it?"
670,no pets here. how about you ?
670,I've got 5. I love animals.
670,Wow! so are you a dog person or a cat person?
670,"Dog, by numbers. 3 of them compared to 2 cats"
670,Aight! Imma ask my dad to get me a cute little pup as a reward for my good grades!
670,"Definitely! It'll likely make you feel better. They're great companions, and super loyal to boot."
670,Is it a hassle to pet dogs? I don't wanna affect my grades because of it. I don't wanna get scolded by dad.
671,well thats very true. Do you have any personal experience?
671,"No, I just like to read about them"
671,What do you liked to read?
671,"Honestly, any sort of nonfiction I can get my hands on.  I recently read a book on the Industrial Revolution.  What about you"
671,I enjoy reading the news and such. I think that the best way to make a difference is to stay informed.
671,It is great to stay informed!  My grandma taught me that
671,I agree! My grandma is also my inspiration
671,I always love sitting with her while she makes her jewelry and just listening to her stories
671,That's so sweet. What types of stories does she tell?
671,Mostly stories from her childhood and younger days.  She always has a lesson to share from each one
671,Me too. My grandmother always liked to tell me I could change the world
671,"Wow, that is so sweet!  Are you guys still close?"
672,"Wow i wasn't even born yet, i only just dropped out of college at 21 because of a girl i was dating"
672,oh that sounds rough did she hurt you that bad?
672,"ya some people know me as a hopeless romantic, so whats going on with you lately?"
672,"I guess a bad relationship and my dog passing away I've just needed some time to myself, been playing alot of video games"
672,"I'm so sorry to hear that, what have you been playing?"
672,mostly skyrim and sims you its too bad you cant play your own built in music to the games 
672,I have never played that game what type of music do you like?

674,People have been eating it that way for hundreds of years. lol
674,"It's fine if I cook it myself, but I don't trust a restaurant to use safe food practices."

677,haha!  Not really.
677,Where else do you find old back t-shirts?
677,eBay and Etsy have some old and unique things
677,Do you ever sell shirts?  Or just return them to the thrift store as a donation?

696,oh no. I love the idea of learning something new. That's way I decided to invest on cryptocurrency
697,correct. I do not know how she would like his movies\
697,I wonder what else a page boy could do? Maybe hand out seating arrangements?
697,"maybe, however I cant stop thinking about my gf trying to leave me."
697,What's her reason for leaving though? 
697,because I dont like  john grisham as much as she does. ridiculous 
697,"who is john grisham, i have no idea!"
697,he's a movie director and also writes books. I like his boks though. 
697,"Oh right, i need to watch some of his movies. That's a poor reason to leave anyway."
697,i know. she wants me to like the same stuff she likes. crazy

699,Mozart is one of the greats. He started composing at the age of 5!
699,I know.  Its amazing to have talent like that.  My dogs dont care for it though.  They just want to play
699,"Haha! Yeah, dogs are silly, but lovable. Did you know they sent a dog in space from Russia?"
700,"yes, I remember reading about that in history class.  dogs are smart!"
700,"Oh, very cool. High school? College? I loved history classes."
700,In college.  I love history too.  Its so interesting to see how things change over time
701,"No not at all, but it's okay.  She had fun I suppose."
701,That must have been strange for the winners of the race. 
701,"Haha yeah.  But not strange enough to stop and wait, if they knew."
701,"Yeah. Oh, by the way I think I'll drop the keto diet. I'm eating way too much meat."
701,That's good!  To lose weight it's best to watch calories and exercise.
701,You are so right about that.  I like to eat and limiting calories I eat is quite difficult.
701,Indeed it can be.  Meditation can help when done right.
701,"I love my girlfriend and would do anything for her, but meditation is out of the question. It is so boring!"
701,It can be boring after doing it for a while.
701,"Yeah. Anyway, got any plans for next weekend?"
701,Probably hang out with my dog and read.  And you?
701,"Going to a friend's house for her birthday, and letting our kids play together."
702,"I have this great Bear Grills knife, perfect for all sorts of woodworking."
702,Smart idea. They have thick handles which makes them easier to grip for long periods of time.
702,"That's true! For example, while watching a movie, I find it relaxing to whittle. I've watched Good Burger so many times now."
702,That is so funny!
702,What do you like to do while you work wood?
702,i just work on my wood work and make couches and stuff
702,"Oh, that's interesting! Ever sold some of your work?"
702,Haven't sold one thing yet. :-(
702,"Oh, that's too bad. Was that something you were hoping to do someday? Like I do with my preserves?"
702,Oh that's awesome that you sell preserves.  My mom buys a lot of those.  I hope to sell them one day.
702,"I could teach you how I make them, and in exchange you could help me repair my couch!"
702,Absolutely! That would be amazing.
703,"Yeah, I remember that. It used to be all over the radio."
703,"Yes, he was the best musician ever."
703,"I dunno. If you're hearing it in a cab all day, he gets kinda old quick."
703,Well anything on repeat gets old fast no matter where you are :)
703,Yeah. And that's the problem with radio stations!
703,"Yea. Like what is the point of listening to the radio, if they're going to play the same song. I can do that on my own without the ads."
703,"Sadly, we're not allowed to use Spotify or Pandora at our jobs..."
703,Thats a bummer.  Wouldn't it be nice to just quit your job?
703,Absolutely. I'm slowly taking online classes in hopes of doing that.
703,Online classes takes some dedication versus going to class. Good for you!
703,"Yeah, but they work around my schedule much better. I can work during the day, do them at night."
703,What kind of classes have you taken?
704,"No, I was returning from tennis practice, and when I arrived home, Mom was picking up the remains."
704,that's so sad ! i'm so sorry .
704,Thank you. I'm just happy I'm not the one who found the dog.
704,Yeah that would be devestating.  How long ago did that happen?
704,"About two years ago maybe? Mom is a dentist, so she's used to seeing gross things."
704,Oh I bet.  Mine would freak out.  She's a concert pianist.
704,"Oh wow, and she does it professionally?"
704,Yes she does. She's very talented. I'd love to see her live.
704,"Wait, you've never seen your mom play live and she's a pianist?"
704,"No, I have been so busy with school work, and she wants me to focus on that.  That's why I graduated top in my class."
704,That's impressive. So I guess one could say your family is really focused on personal accomplishments.
704,YEah that's true. 
705,"I enjoy cooking and travelling, sometimes golf"
705,"Oh i love travelling too, whenever i go somewhere i have to buy a pair of shoes."
705,"I typically drive my Prius on road trips across the country.  I love tofu too, weird I know.  Whats your favorite food?"
705,"I love anything that is Mexican, that has to be the best food out there."
705,I enjoy mexican as well.  So you are a shoe person?
705,"always ! i went shopping today for new shoes, i can't resist buying them!"
705,You have a favorite pair?
705,"Has to be Vans, what about you?"
705,"Me too! love Vans, especially since growing up in the 80s"
705,great ! where did you grow up ? i bet you have loads too
705,south carolina.  you?
705,i'm from a lovely place called Ohio
706,"I know. Everyone wants something from me, who should I try to please?"
706,Do what makes you happy
706,And what if that angers mom and dad? Sometimes I wish I didn't have to wake up in the morning...
706,"That is not a way to think about things, besides you can't please everyone"
706,"You sound just like my therapist, who never understands me."
706,Have you ever thought about getting a dog? Great therapy...
706,"Getting a dog sounds like a good idea. I'd like a poodle, if I could pick any breed."
706,Poodles are cool! 
706,They look so smug! What kind of dog do you like?
706,I have a golden retriever...I love my dog
706,Those dogs always look so happy all the time. I bet they never have depression.
706,My dog is always happy and helps me when I'm feeling down
707,It's a celebration!  They just spontaneously got married last weekend!  They are having a small gathering to celebrate their marriage.
707,Cool! That sounds really special and personal. I'm sure they both will really enjoy that!
707,"I was supposed to work, but I have a really nice boss and he let me off."
707,"That's great that you have a really nice boss, most I have had are not nice."
707,"Yea, it's a pretty decent job.  I guess I need to take some sort of gift to the party."
707,What kind of gift are you thinking of getting?
707,They both like the ballet so maybe some tickets to that.  My mom was a ballet dancer.
707,"that sounds like a really nice gift . after that , what are you planning to do?."

707,"I understand, I have trouble waking up early too."

709,"I have that why I waiting on the results, I slept with a HIV infected prostitute, and the condom broke when i was doing her from behind."
709,The good news is the chances of actually getting HIV is relatively low. You should not have to worry about it.

709,lol HIV + I will fit right in holly wood 
709,Haha that is true!  There are plenty of them in there!

710,I was born in 87. I loved the alternative metal movement in the mid 90's. 
710,"what a coincidence , i love rock music !"
710,"80's rock is my personal favorite, but Tool was definitely one of my favorites of the 90's"
710,"They were really influential. I always considered them having more to do with the punk scene, though. Haven't really gotten very dep into their evolution, I have to admit."
710,I think in the early 90's everybody tried to slip into the Punk scene. From 95 or 96 on they were really heavy
710,Yeah.  I started to get annoyed with some of it because many tried too hard.
710,Yea. I went with my older brother to a concert in 97. We were the only olive skinned people there haha
710,"I bet!  Times have changed a lot, especially with music."
710,Yea. I still like heavy stuff. Nobody expects it because i'm kinda nerdy
710,"Haha yeah.  I'm not sure why people don't expect that.  I wasn't a nerd myself in school, but I knoew many who liked metal."
710,I wanna be a librarian. Most people expect me to like classical stuff
710,Yes!  That means there is some good balance going on there!
711,Yes.  Also reminds me of growing up and the fact my mom was a weightlifter
711,speaking of nostalgia i was watching star trek on netflicks it gave me the option of setting the audio to klingon
711,"haha, that is funny.  You have any ideas how to fix feet odor?  nothing I've tried has worked"

711,"Oh wow, never would have thought that.  You have any hobbies?"
711,I like playing tonsil hockey with random back packers.
711,"sounds very fun, I should try that sometime"
711,"right they're very unsuspecting, did you order pizza? "
711,"Everyday, today I'm waiting on my BBQ tofu with stuff crust.  10 more minutes and its free"

712,Im sorry to hear that. I have 2 cats myself. 
712,That's cool. I'm looking for a new dog.
712,You should think about a cat. I read to my cats every day. 
712,Never been a fan of cats. 
712,i understand . they're not for everyone . what else do you like to do ?
712,I work out a lot.

713,Do you like brownies? 
713,I do! They are one of my favorite foods. Do you like brownies?

713,"That's great! My best friend lives in Japan, and he introduced me to Japanese techno. What's your favorite blues artist?"
713,I love Eric Clapton and B.B. King. I've gotten into nightcore recently with some remixes: is that like Japanese techno?
713,I like B.B. King too! I think it is similar. I am still learning about this music!
713,"I like, ""The Thrill Is Gone"" by B.B. King but he has made other great songs too. "
713,"That's a great one. I also like ""Let the Good Times Roll."" How did you get into blues music?"
713,My mother: it's still her favorite type of music. I want to get her a CD of blues for the holidays. 
713,That is really nice of you. She will love that
713,Are there any Japanese techno songs you would like to own? 
713,"I think I own a lot! I would love to see Ken Ishii live, but I've never traveled outside the US so I am nervous to go"
713,If you go to Japan I'm sure your friend would give you a grand tour of their home! I want to go there and Ireland
714,What type of dogs do you like?
714,"I like golden retrievers, poodles, and Yorkies."
714,Cool!  Do you own one?  I've a pomeranian. 
714,I have a Yorkie.

714,"Pretty good, as long as the kid and the dog are both well trained!"
714,Ha!  Kids are harder to train sometimes!
714,"That's so true. I love to take my dog running, do you run at all?"
714,I run some.  I prefer hiking though.  I think a snail runs faster than I do
714,Hey hiking is great too. Are you into politics at all? That's my true passion.
714,"I follow them, and vote, but not a true passion.  I do my duty as a citizen."
714,What do you feel like your duty as a citizen is? Voting?
715,I like Fermented Salmon Heads and Jellied Moose Nose with a side of bat paste. some people dont like it when i drive my automous car
715,Oh I love driving my automous car!  I usually wake up at 4 am every morning and drive it to get coffee before work.
715,OMG we have so much in common. how do you take your coffee?
715,"Dark, Black, strong!  Mystic Monk Midnight blend being my favorite!  I'm a huge coffee fanatic!"
715,"sounds like it, maybe we don't have that much in common after all i like lots of cream you know what i mean..."
715,Oh I get that!  There are some people who don't even like coffee!
715,thats just weird. do you know how to get rid of foot odour?
715,No I don't. Thats why I leave it to the pros!
715,do you know any foot pros?
715,None that I can think of.  But if I had the issue I would leave it to them.
715,what issue do you mean? 
715,foot odor
716,"True, in some ways a writer has to be more creative in order to sell to the public."
716,"Writers have to develop long term characters, not just one piece. It's got to be difficult"
716,Both have to create meaning behind their work. An Artist has to not onloy produce a piece with meaning but find an audience that understands the meaning.
716,Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to be an artist. It just seems so hard
716,I imagine it could be liberating also. Working when it suits you.
716,"It would I'm sure. But I already wish I made more money...I couldn't be a ""starving artist"""
716,Art majors have a hard time finding work.
716,Yea. I just don't think I'm brave enough
716,I don't understand why colleges continue to offer such programs.
716,Me neither. There's absolutely no job market
716,Yet they tell students that there are jobs.
716,I guess it depends on what you're willing to sacrifice to be able to work.
717,It was part of the Catskills: have you been there before?
717,I have! That is very close to where I grew up. What brought you to the Catskills?
717,My job actually: I work in a bookstore and one of my customers gave me the idea to go!
717,That is really cool. I love getting travel recommendations. What else did you do while you were out there?
717,I also visited Albany New York for the first time: I've lived in the southeast most of my life. 
717,That's so cool! That is right where I grew up. I am a big Albany sports fan lol. What made Albany different from the Southeast?
717,The nightlife and the attractions! I also loved the various restaurants. Where I grew up it's country land and quiet. 
717,Albany does have some great restaurants. They're surprisingly diverse. My favorite is Bombers Burritos. I would like to visit the country sometime
717,"If you get to Memphis Tennessee, close to where I used to live, there's plenty of BBQ restaurants. "
717,Yum! I love BBQ. Brisket is my favorite. What is your go-to dish?
717,My favorite restaurant: the Blues City Cafe has the best BBQ ribs I've ever had! So I guess ribs would be mine. 
717,Good choice. Ribs are too messy for me; I get jealous of people who can eat them without getting sauce everywhere!
718,I am the mother.
718,Tell me about your daughter.
718,"Well, my daughter is 7 years old and is in grade 2."
718,"Oh great, and what about your wife."
718,I am the mother! My daughter is almost the same height as me
718,Please help me how to grow my daughter?
718,"Well, start feeding her healthy diet and make sure to have her enrolled in outdoor activities."
718,Sure i will follow that activities.

718,Do you have any other child?
718,"No, I do not."
718,What food regularly give your child?
718,Fruits and veggies
718,Thanks for you help.
719,I want to before I die.
719,I'm scared of dying. I tend to place blame on other people even when i know it is my fault. 
720,"I live in Tennessee,its freezing today!What about you?"
720,"Its not too bad here, cool but cold.  Does it ever snow in Tennessee?"
720,Every once in a while.I usually get a big pot of venison stew going.
720,Isn't venison deer?  What does it taste like?
720,"Correct.Kinda like beef,a little more chewy...whats your favorite band?"
720,"I don't really have a favorite band, just whatever I'm in the mood for in the moment.  What is yours?"
720,Mine is The story so far.What do you do for work?
720,I work hard everyday.  Do you work?
720,"Yeah,its okay work,a little repetitive,but interesting none the less."
720,What do you put in your venison stew?
720,"Lots of chunks of venison,celery,carrots,onions,potatoes,and my special blend of spices."
720,That sounds really good.  Where do you get the venison from?
721,I usually read on my Kindle. You?
721,Yep I use Kindle too. Love ebooks! What's your favorite food?
721,"Yes, ebooks are so handy! A great way to get my Stephen King Fix. As for food, I love Pad Thai"
721,"Pad thai is good, but how about pizza? I love mushroom and sausage"
721,"Ooh, you have good taste. I love mushroom on pizza, but no sausage. I'm a vegetarian"
721,I enjoy a lot of great vegetarian recipes. do you have any favorites?
721,"One thing I love is to blend cashew nuts as a parmesan substitute. It's amazing, you've got to try it!"
721,Sounds like a great idea. Ever used nutritional yeast?
721,"Yeah, I love it! Especially for mac and cheese. what's your favorite vegetarian recipe?"
721,"I love a good veggie pizza. tomatoes, spinach, and nutritional yeast"
721,"Mmmm, that sounds good. Now you're making me hungry."
721,where's the best pizza you've ever had?
721,I usually make my own! 
722,Is there something that could make the stay better for you if it could be changed? Like food or entertainment?
722,"The food, definitely. I like to bake for the folks that I live with, but the regular food isn't that good"
722,That's wonderful that you would bake for them! What's your signature dish?
722,I make a mean peanut butter brownie. I also make matcha shortbread. Do you like to cook or bake?
722,I actually just started! I've made a chocolate cake and chocolate chip cookies from scratch!
722,That's great! Good job! What other things do you want to try and tackle?
722,I would love to learn how to make a mean brisket or homemade stews. 
722,Yum! My mom makes the best brisket. I guess the key is a lot of liquid and a big roasting pan
722,I need to buy a roasting pan: I brought a crockpot and a dutch oven that I can't wait to use!
722,That's great! I still need to amp up my kitchen gear. I've heard great things about crock pots
722,I know there's a craze for the insta-pots they just seem a bit pricey. I would like one but I don't want my cooking to ruin it!
722,They can be expensive - maybe wait for a Black Friday or holiday deal?
722,"Yes, that insta-pot maybe on sale for Black Friday: I'll take your advice and checkout the deals!"
723,"Well, I used to be a chef, but i m a teacher now. What do you do?"
723,"Oh wow, being a teacher is awesome. Since you are a chef, do you teach cooking on the side?"
723,"No, but I like to bake in my spare time. "
723,That is so cool. Maybe you will have your own show one day and I get to see you!
723,I would love that! What do you like to do?
723,I love cooking as well. I wish I could become a chef one day and own my restaurant.
723,Me too. I would like that very much.
723,"When I have my restaurant, I can hire you :)"
723,"That sounds good! If I get mine open first, I will hire you as well. haha. "
723,"Sorry, I hope you didn't mind. I joke around a lot."
723,No worries! I am a jokester as well. 
723,Let me know the next time you are in town and maybe we can get together and tell jokes
724,"I cant i weigh 850 lbs, going to need a fork lift to get me out of here"
724,Do you know anyone that can fix the things?
724,no can you? I will pay you to un clog the toilet. apparently its backed up and splashing on the floor every time he flushes  
724,"I'm not very handy when it comes to plumbing, but I have some community contacts with social services that could help him to set things up if he is willing."
724,"I call them they say its landlords responsibility, Roto router said say they flushing depends down and they're tired of coming out to unjam adult diapers from the bowl."
724,Has anyone spoken with him about not flushing these items? It seems like that particular issue isn't going to get any better until he stops doing what causes the issue.
724,"ya he has been reported to the tribune, they put kitty litter in the recycle too no respect i tell ya "
724,It sounds like maybe he is either incapable of comprehending or just plain unwilling to comply
724,thats nothing the other guy pisses in the sink because the toilets clogged 
724,that is horrible ! he should be ashamed of himself !
724,agreed what kinda example does that set for his animals 
724,Sounds like the landlord should start the eviction process. I would hate to know that my properties were being cared for like that
725,it was a strange whispering sound
725,I bet that really freaked you out.
725,"yeah, and i was in a pretty dep sleep, so when I woke up it was really strange"
725,Did you hear anything else afterwards?
725,"no, it went away, so I could fall back asleep"
725,Thank goodness for that.
725,Has something like that ever happened to you?
725,Yes.  And it seems so real and I wake up to check.
725,what was it in your case?
725,Ususally it's after a read something and it is =very intense.  I have a Master's in Italian Lit so it happens.
725,"interesting area of study, why did you choose that?"
725,I love Literature.  It was something different.  And I was just drawn to it.
726,"Seriously? When I lived in Texas, it was fried eggs every day for breakfast"
726,"I love fried eggs! However, I love scrambled eggs even more!"
726,Scrambled is a great way to prepare them. I usually throw in some bell pepper and chives. Do you like to cook?
726,I don't like to cook that much. I prefer to dance instead. 
726,That's awesome. What type of dance?
726,The Electric Slide.
726,Classic. That must be a god workout!
726,"Yes, it is what is your favorite dance?"
726,I am a big fan of Latin dances like salsa. But not to dance. Just to watch :)
726,Salsa is amazing! Do you have any other hobbies in your free time?
726,"I love to travel. I have moved a lot over the years, so I have friends in several states to drop in on"
726,Traveling is great! Have you gone anywhere recently?
727,"I suppose I did, mostly listening to the great composers and getting lost in the music."
727,"Ah, I see. Was the music passed down to you by someone or did you learn it yourself? I know sometimes people learn it from unknown composers."
727,"I don't know how to play the music, but the music disks were passed down to me."
727,That is interesting. Music is a huge part of my families hertitage.
727,"Do you also enjoy getting lost in the music? My dreams always seem better than real life, which always disappoints me."
727,"Yeah, I love to dream. It's experiences recounted in a narrative form that resembles real life somehow. Sometimes you think it's real."
727,I can relate to that. Especially when you want it to be real.
727,Yes. A lot of the time daydreams would be so nice if they could be fulfilled. Most daydreams that I have tend to be positive.
727,"I'm sure having positive daydreams contributes to a good mental health, because there is a point where negative thoughts are hamrful."
727,Yes. We can try to improve our mental health for ourselves and those around us.
727,What a positive outlook on life. You should be a life coach!
727,"I could use some positive coaching in my life as well, I have been having trouble losing weight"
728,I might be able to borrow one.
728,I hope that works out!I work in fast food so not many of my coworkers have been married.
728,I hope to have country music at my wedding.  Weddings can be expensive.
728,"Fore sure!Weddings are very expensive,but hopefully its only done once.Im more of a sit at home and play Mortal combat type of person.Whats your favorite mortal combat character?"
728,I do like video games.  My favorite?  Probably Kung Lao.  What about you?
728,"Milena!! I am unstoppable with Milena,my friends always rage quit when playing against me!"
728,She is fast as heck!  I'm not that good at Mortal Kombat.  I used to play it a lot that.
728,"My reflexes have slowed down as ive gotten older,but i still do pretty well.Where are you from?"
728,Heck yeah!  I'm from New York.  What about you?
728,"Im in Tennessee currently,but grew up in Cleveland Ohio.Ive been to new york many times."
728,Nice.  Tennessee has a lot of good country singers.  Nashville is great.
728,Yeah almost every time i go to downtown nashville i get to see a famous country singer.
729,"Me too, buts its alright.  What is your favorite color?"
729,My favorite color is also red. It has been since I was a kid. 
729,Oh cool.  How does red look on you?
729,Pretty good I think. I can't find many scrubs in red though unfortunately...except for around Christmas or Valentine's day.
729,"That stinks, I know scrubs can get kind of expensive.  What do you do for work?"
729,I am a Labor & Delivery nurse. I love babies - I have 3 of my own!
729,"I bet they keep you very busy, plus your job too!  When do you find time to relax?"
729,It's tough but very rewarding. I'm really into yoga so I typically do that when getting off work.
729,"It sounds like you enjoy staying busy.  Yoga is very relaxing, I don't do it as regularly as I would like"
729,I do - I can always find something that needs to get done. Yoga keeps me grounded! What do you do to relax?
729,I like to have a few drinks and watch a movie.  What type of movies do you like?
729,That sounds like a good time - I like mostly action movies and romantic comedies
730,That is a great place to be! My parents were close to there but we are not very close anymore 
730,Do you mean you don't get along with your parents or you just moved far away from them?
731,He has been studying to become a CPA. He just took his final exam.
731,What does he plan on doing once he is a CPA? I'm sure he will pass the exam!
731,His first plan is to take us to climb Mount Everest to celebrate! I've always wanted to do that. Then look for a job.
731,That sounds amazing! I would like to visit Tibet but climbing Mount Everest sounds like a fun challenge!
731,That would be so much fun. Do you have plans to visit soon?
731,"Not soon, maybe in 3-5 years but I'm taking a cruise to Cozumel next Spring Break! I'm very excited!"
731,Wow you must love to travel. I don't travel a lot but I have gone hunting in Africa and shot a lion once.
731,I've never been that far! I travel for college and I want to be a polygot when I'm older. What was Africa like?
731,Oh that is impressive. Africa was very nice. The animals there are beautiful. It was very exciting. What year in college are you?
731,"I'm a junior in college, my 3rd year. I hope to travel for my career as I love the beach and surfing. "
731,I bet you would do a lot of traveling being a polygot. I've never surfed but I always wanted to. Is it hard?
731,When you learn to balance it gets easier to surf. To me the waves do most of the work and it took me awhile to master. 
732,That's adorable.  What's your cat's name?  Mine is Pickles.
732,Mine is named Speckles also! What a coincidence. 
732,Haha.  I have had many cats over the years.  I can't seem to get enough of them.
732,"Oh, so you're the ""crazy cat lady"" that I keep hearing about? haha"
732,Haha.  Not quite.  I currently only have two.  But I have always had a cat since was 3 years ols.
732,My ex GF had cats and I fell in love. I miss them more than her 
732,Pets are like family.  I get that.  
732,Yeah. They are. Maybe we could get speckles and speckles together for a play date one day
732,Sure!  I'm sure Pickles would love another cat t o torment besides me.
733,thats intersesting.  I love pizza
733,same
733,Do you have any favorite toppings?
733,Oh as long as it's a supreme pizza it's my favorite! What about you?
733,"I don't eat meat, so I like lots of veggies!"
733,"Veggies are good, especially on pizza! Mushroom and Onion is my favorite other than supreme."
733,Do you hav a favorite pizza place?  I love walking to the place on my corner late at night
733,I like jet's pizza a lot.  My college buds and me get pizza from there.  Is it expensive where you go?
733,"no, its cheap!  Great pizza, great price!  and I can walk!"
733,Heck yeah!  Those are the best when you can walk to them!
733,I love walking at night when it is completely dark.  I love the night.  Soooo peaceful
733,"Yes, its always quiet past midnight.  It is relaxing."
734,"Wow, I didn't know that. "
734,"Yeah and The band went on to become major stars, and by the early 1980s but they will always be a one album wonder"
734,What other music do you like?

734,Me too. Pretty eclectic. What other hobbies do you have?
734,"Mainly Youtube, I do some freelance work on it occasionally, and Reddit. Lots of Reddit."
734,Anything outside? I'm into walking my dog
734,"yes. I love the outdoors. looking for lost treasure, do you poop and scoop?"
734,"Oh definitely, must be a responsible dog walker!"
734,"Well in that case, I guess I better start hiding! woof"
734,What kind of dogs do you like?
734,My favorites are huskies and big slobbery St Bernards. They give the best hugs and cuddles. just hide the penut butter
735,Where do they usually grow? I enjoy planting flowers in my garden.
735,Cold areas like Canada I believe.
735,I do not think they can survive in Georgia. It is pretty hot here.
735,"Definitely too hot, I can see your point."
735,"Do you think if I were to pot it inside, would I be able to do it otherwise?"
735,I guess that depends on how cold you keep your home. I would have to gather more information. 
735,I am originally from Canada so I like to keep my house cold so maybe that could work!
735,It might work. Have you researched on how much sunlight they require?
735,Not really. I should do some research to get all the details.Do you like Narcissus?
735,They are ok. I prefer Tropical plants myself.
735,Cool. Do you have any tropical plants?
736,Unfortunately when I went back into the bathroom and it was gone! 
736,"Haha! even though im an older lady,i watch a lot of spongebob,this reminds me of a spongebob episode lol"
736,I used to watch spongebob all the time when I was younger! I love that show 
736,Its great!i dont think ill ever outgrow it.... Its funny how you notice things in cartoons when your older that were over your head as a kid.
736,"I totally agree!! Do you celebrate Halloween? If so, how was your night? I love free candy"
736,I love halloween! Seeing my kids dressed up and so excited is amazing!
736,Good to hear! I go to college part time so there were parties everywhere. But I prefer to take my younger sisters trick or treating.
736,Boy do i miss halloween parties on campus!it was always non stop craziness haha.
736,That’s for sure! What kind of things did you do for fun in college?
736,Mostly partied and made bad decisions! I dont regret it though because now im laid back because i got it all out of my system at an early age.
736,"That’s great advice, I think I know what I’ll be doing this weekend!"
736,Go for it! Enjoy your youth while you have it!! Whats your major?
737,My best friend has red hair! All 12 of my kids all have my blonde hair. Not a single one has brown like their Daddy.
737,One my kids has the red/orange to strawberry blonde if in the sun. My other one has the deep red almost starting to turn brown but not quite.
737,Aww I bet that is adorable. How old are your kids?
737,10 and 13 . amazing they grow up so quickly . one already thinks herself an adult .
737,Yes they do! It seems like yesterday that my oldest was a few weeks old. Now she is turning 33 tomorrow. 
737,I hear 35 is the new 25!
737,Yes! I just turned 53 last month and I feel like I'm in my 30s. What do you do for a living?
737,"I work in IT, what about you?"
737,Oh that is really cool. I'm an accountant. What do you do for fun?
737,i love to do that also and play with my blond hair ! trying new cuts
737,Oh what kind of hair cut are you interested in? I would love to put purple back in my hair like I had in my 20s. 
737,I'd love to go red - not sure what hue though. Not sure how much brightness I want.
738,It's hard getting the kids ready and out the door on time.  But as their father I need to succeed! 
738,Success is so important!  I'm only 21 but I know the value of working hard
738,It's extremely important.  Especially when you are an adult.  It sets a good example.
738,i agree . i feel like i have a young lifestyle but mature mind
738,"That's good.  I'm all about having fun, but knowing your limits and being responsible are very good qualities."
738,"Its really important, especially as you get older."
738,Absolutely.  We have to have self control.
738,"Oh definitely, also habits are important to education too!"
738,Yes!  Setting good habits as a young person is so beneficial in life.  We are instilling this into our children even now at young ages.
738,It's never to early to start
738,Did you feel that you had good role models growing up or did you naturally just make good decisions?
738,"No, my mom was a great role model.  Couldn't have done it without her"
739,I liked my ex's cat better than i liked her 
739,Lol thats funny.  Its easy to like animals a lot more than people.  Are cats your favorite animal?
739,yeah been eating them since i was young the local Chinese place cooks them well
739,"Oh, wow.  I've never tried cat, don't think I ever will.  How did they prepare them for you?"
739,well generally they shave the with a bic shaver first i believe and then add them to the wok 
739,"Hmm, interesting.  I guess that is one way to take care of the stray cat population.  "
739,ya its better than them spraying in your garden 
739,True.  What do you grow in your garden?
739,nothing crazy just the garden variety peyote and marijuana 
739,Never knew there was a garden variety peyote.  You must live somewhere warm
739,ya its pretty warm here in asia how about you 
739,"Fairly cool where I am, its autumn here.  Your halfway around the world from here."
740,Pizza is my favorite food. I can eat it just about anytime. Especially pepperoni pizza.
740,i love pepperoni the best with mushrooms .
740,My husband has started making pizza from scratch. It's probably the best I've eaten. Where is your favorite pizza place?
740,I really love Carbones pizza! What’s your favorite pizza place?
740,We have a place called Buck's pizza around here. I love it. It's nice to sit back read a good book and enjoy some pizza.
740,"That’s sounds awesome. If I see some yummy pizza, I buy it! I really like reading too, what genre do you like best?"
740,I enjoy anything supernatural really. I have really enjoyed some zombie books lately. Have you ever heard of GameLand? It was really good.
740,Maybe! What's it about? I believe it was a horror film in 1933 as well.
740,It's about people who control zombies with a chip in the zombies head and they use them to fight like in a game. Then some teenagers sneak into the place.
740,Sounds interesting. I'd love to check that out!
740,The author is Saul Tanpepper. He has several good books. Since I love nighttime I like to curl up and read before bed.
740,I love reading right before bed too! Honestly I live to go outside at night and eavesdrop on my neighbors arguments.
741,"Wow, that is really cool. Do you have a close family?"
741,We live all over the globe but we still stay close. We especially make trips around the holidays to each other. 
741,"That is great. Family is so important. I try to visit my parents as much as possible, especially on Buddhist holidays. "
741,"That's wonderful, were you able to see them during Losar? "
741,"I was! It's a really big deal to them, so I always make an effort. Is your family religious?"
741,I was raised Protestant but I am not religious myself. I hang up prayer flags on my porch and prefer meditation. 
741,Gotcha. It's important to steer your own course and do what works for you.
741,That is some wise advice. Are you religious as well? I find that those who are or are not have still a similar path to walk.
741,"Deep words! I still consider myself a Buddhist, but my views have opened up a lot since I was young."
741,Wisdom comes with age indeed. When I got older my parents just wanted me to be happy being me. But they always taught me to respect others. 
741,I think we are both lucky as far as parents go. Mine taught me to respect life in all its forms. And eat lots of veggies ;)
741,You just reminded me to eat more veggies! :D I was taught by my parents there's sugar in almost everything so adding more isn't helpful.
742,I was in the woods on a hike so i thought there was no hope of finding it
742,"Wow! It's amazing that it was even found, much less returned. "
742,"right, i was with my 3 siblings and they all discouraged me from even looking"
742,The only thing better would have been if the person who returned it had been hot. 
742,"My husband may not have liked that, lol"
742,"Yeah. He may not have, but you never know. haha"
742,I'm just glad I don't have to replace all my cards and ID!
742,"Oh, I know. I never carry cash. So, my cards would be the important thing for me."
742,Yeah I hardly ever have cash on me. Luckily the few dollars i had in there were all still there when it was returned
742,Sounds like you were one of the lucky ones
742,"Definitely a lucky day! WEll I need to go give my kid a bath, any idea how we end this?"
742,We each have to respond six times and then it give you the option to end
743,So what are the songs
743,"My sacrifice is my favorite song...i actually followed the band on tour for three months.I lost my job,i could literally run into traffic at this point."
743,I liked it too.
743,"It was a great experience following them on tour,even though it ended with me being jobless and on welfare last month,ill never forget the memories!"
743,Helping well fare is good one.
743,Right!! So what do you do for fun?
743,Mostly playing games.
743,Whats your favorite game? i just got done playing modern warfare.
743,My favourite game is handball.
743,How do you play? Ive never tried it.
743,I play on the ground with my friends.
743,I have no friends since they found out i was on welfare.
743,Come we will play together.
744,Do you have a good group of friends?
744,"yes , i've amazing friends . how about you "
744,Same.  Being adopted as a baby has made me realize how important friends are
744,"That's so good to hear! I am actually adopted myself, and I love my family so much."
744,How old were you when you got adopted?
744,26!
744,"That's good you found some parents to take care of you, they must be great people."
744,"Yes, i just hope im a good parent to my son!"
744,Do you just have the one child?  How old is he?
744,I have three two toddlers and a teen
744,I bet they are all a handful.
744,More than a handful.
745,"Yea. I got married last year and that didn't work out, so I'm looking to get my girl in better shape"
745,what happened to loving people the way they are?
745,We have to be mindful of weight distribution living on a boat
745,Hmm I guess that makes sense. Are you a healthy eater?
745,Very. I live a clean life style
745,"Have you ever read the Twilight books? Some of the vampires in there are considered ""vegetarians"" "
745,Nah. I'm not really into fantasy literature

746,Do you sell them since you go to the fairs?
746,Yes I do attempt to sell them
746,"that's great , do you sell them online ?"
747,It's really hard to understand. I have no idea why my husband just left me
747,"Wow, that is so sad to hear. Did you try counseling?"
747,I wanted to but he wouldn't
747,Oh wow that's a real bummer. I hope things start looking up for you
747,He left me with four kids and two dogs. I'm not sure what to do
747,I hope you have the support of your family and friends
747,I do and they have been wonderful
747,That's so good to hear. I know you can make it through this
747,I believe I will. May have to give the dogs away though
747,Don't give up on them! Dogs can be such a comfort at a time like that
747,They're just so much to take care of
747,"I understand, hopefully the kids can help!"
748,"Oh, really. I believe it. "
748,How do you feel about coffee?  Seattle is definitely the place for it!
748,I love coffee!
748,I think that's why I love Seattle so much!  
748,"I like the shades of blue, it's my favorite color."
748,Shades of blue.  Good colors.
748,Do you play any insruments?
748,"No instruments.  I own a banjo because I love it, but I don't know how to play it."
748,My mom taught me how to play the cello but I mostly forgot by now.
748,That's nice.  I guess if you don't practice it would be easy to forget.
748,Yes true.
748,I tried watching YouTube channels to teach myself the banjo.  Maybe I'm just too old to learn how to play.haha
749,"Thank you! It’s a girl, but I still need help picking out a name. Any suggestions "
749,"Abigail, Rene and Scarlett are names that just popped into my head. You don't have to pick out a name until you're ready though."
749,"I really like Scarlett, that’s a very pretty name. I still have a week to decide!"
749,Once the baby is here all your worries will melt away. Will there be family to help you when the baby comes home?
749,"Thank you, that makes me feel much better. My mother will be staying with us for a few weeks to help out!"
749,"Whatever you do, just make sure you are able to leave your home!"
749,Thanks for the advice! What do you like to do in your free time?
749,Listening to music and playing board games. Like cavemen. Lol How about you?
749,That’s sounds like fun. I like to read books and watch TV in my spare time.
749,I do love to read as well. Do you happen to have a favorite author or book?
749,"I love the book Secret Life of Bees. What about you, do you have a favorite book?"
749,"Scarlet Begonias, 100%. I get weird looks for this, but oddly enough, it reminds me of The Dresden Files books. Ever read them?"
750,You think working hard and getting money.
750,I'd prefer to work hard and make my own money. 
750,But it is not easy to work hard.
750,That's true. But it's not impossible. 
750,Tell me any  way.
750,I'm sure you can figure it out.
750,Thank you so much for your good words.
750,You're welcome. I hope you have a great day!
750,Thank you wish you to the same
750,Thank you for your good wishes. God bless!

750,Have a good day.
751,"Yeah, but my income is limited to social security. So, I dont have much expendable income."
751,"I put my family first,so i rarely have expendable income either."
751,"Yes. Family is important, especially when you get to be my age."
751,"How old are you?im 27,6'7 270lbs. I hope im done growing haha."
751,"I'm 68, 5'3 150 lbs"
751,"Everyone always seems nervous by my presence,but im just a gentle giant full of love."
751,I bet you are. haha. If only I were about 40 years younger...
751,What would you do?
751,"That would depend on you, sir"
751,So you have a thing for big guys huh.
751,"I did in my day, in more than one way"
751,Youd be amazed at the amount of woman who throw themselves at me because of my size.But my wife comes first.
751,"Well, I can imagine you WOULD have women throwing themselves at you if everything were in proportion"
752,"Wow, you know your stuff! I am a huge Bud fan, though I enjoy a good Pepsi sometimes"
752,I read too many subtitles. I'm a Coca Cola person myself.
752,"Nothing wrong with Coke, but Pepsi just tastes better, I think. Love it when I'm at the ballgame. You a sports fan?"
752,Not really. I watch Japanese cartoons in my free time.
752,"Gotcha. I watched an episode of Naruto on the subway once, but it was a little weird for me"
752,"i studied the language in school , was tired of reading subtitles for the anime ."
752,Really? That's great. It sounds like a tough language to master.
752,it can be . it was a bit of a learning curve .
752,I bet. Are you fluent now?
752,Not at all. I keep learning everyday. 
752,"Well, that's the important thing. You'd do well here. There are so many Japanese tourists in my city during the summer!"
752,I have noticed the tourist areas have a lot of Japanese tourists.
753,"One brother, he's a pug! I've been working odd hours trying to pick up commercials and work at the community theater as well"
753,I have never in my life heard of that breed before.  I'll look it up.  That is really cool I have 3 crazy untrained minpin
753,So cute! My pug's name is Pepper - he is so funny and has a great personality
753,Very nice!  My cat is smarter than most dogs but she is far too stubborn to try and please me!  I am after all just her servant
753,Haha - what kind of cat and how old?
753,My cat is 5 years old. Cats can hear too faint and too hidh frequency for human ears
753,That's funny - I know these animals have crazy good hearing. My dogs are always barking at nothing.
753,"Lol, if only we can understand dogs and listen to what they are saying. That would be hilarious."
753,"Yes definitely, I'm sure they're barking at something, we just can't hear it. Maybe it's the dogs across the street!"
753,It could be! Sometimes what I imagine it to be is worse than what it is in reality.
753,"Yes - like ""Theres"
753,"Yes! I like dancing in my free time, what do you like to do in your spare time?"
754,"yes theres plenty and its very competitive , are you romantic?"
754,"Not necessarily. I like basketball a lot! The Grizzlies are the best, but Toronto has 2 pretty decent teams."
754,some people say im a loser when it comes to romance
754,You should try getting out and just being yourself. I met my wife at a basketball game. 
754,what kind of car do you drive around in?
754,"I have a truck. It's not too good on gas mileage, but it's nice to be able to go off road. "
754,"I live in my car just outside of LA , do you live in LA?"
754,"No I'm in Austin, and there are a lot of people living in tents here."
754,have you ever met someone who lives in their car?
754,"I lived in my car when I was 17, but yes I've known a guy that lived in train cars before he got arrested because he didn't have a car."
754,my car is foreign so when people see me they think im a foreigner
754,Is it not very diverse in LA? Austin has tons of people from all over the world. It's not like the rest of TX.
755,It was a little box turtle.  So adorable.  I hope it's ok.
755,It sounds like it may have been a box turtle.  They are good as pets! Have you ever had a turtle?
755,I have not.  I have just visited them when my friend's have had them.  Very cute though.
755,i also have a turtle name george . do you have pets ?
755,"George the Turtle.  Love it!  I have cats, Felix and Zeke."
755,Oh such cute names. I work at an animal shelter so i have a soft spot for animals 
755,that is so sweet!  I do love animals as well.  I have had pets my entire life.  I was raised to love them as family.
755,i agree ! would love to meet your cats one day Im sure my kitten Toby would enjoy that 
755,I love the name!  Felix is 16.  My poor baby.  He isn't doing well.  Zeke is 7.  We love them to pieces.
755,"Aww, Have you had Felix from a baby ?"
755,"He found us when he was just 6 months old, the day before Halloween. He is a black cat.  we couldn't leave him outside."
755,"aww, he was very lucky to find your family them. Sounds like he's in a great home :)"
756,I just have an office job. I work hard though. I think I need a vacation. 
756,"Same here, I need a vacation desperately. "
756,Where would you like to go?
756,I would love to go Egypt. 
756,Egypt is interesting! I'd love to go to Greece/
756,I've heard nothing but great things about Greece. 
756,I studied Greek and Roman history in college so I love it. 
756,I am fascinated with Ancient Greek mythology
756,It's super interesting! And really weird when you learn about it in depth. 
756,I can only imagine
756,how has your day been?
756,"It's been okay, I'm currently at work. "
757,I don't. I spend most of my time sitting on my computer
757,That's not bad just your preference.  I like TV as well. I really liked that old BBC show Creatures Great and Small.
757, I love BBC! I love learning about other cultures
757,I also like watching the British Broadcasting Corporation.
757,So what do you do for fun?
757,"Mainly Youtube, I do some freelance work on it occasionally, and Reddit. Lots of Reddit."
757,Reddit is fun. I spend a lot of my computer time on there
757,I also enjoy running!
757,I like to hike
757,I run so that I can eat my favorite dessert - cheesecake. 
757,I like chocolate chip cookies
757,Have you ever had 
758,I reached 50k subscribers on my channel recently woo!
758,wow congrats! What kind of videos do you make?
759,What else do you do with your free time? I am a novice writer.
759,"Yeah I work in sales, but I really don't like it. Think I might like to be a personal trainer"
759,Sounds like you're pretty fit
759,yeah I think of myself as an athlete for sure. lots of different sports. how about you?
759,I was athletic in my day. Not as much so now
759,yeah it's harder as you get older for sure. I love to hit the gym and play team sports though still
759,I was always more into baseball and basketball
759,Have a favorite team or teams?
759,Carolina Panthers and Boston Red Sox
759,awesome. I'd rather watch sports than be at work any day
759,"Yeah. Ironically, both teams play ""Sweet Caroline"" at games"
759,that's hilarious. I guess it's a sporting event classic!
760,"Yep, guess we’ll just have to go to the indoor pool!"
760,no way theres way too many people in the indoor pool
760,"You’re right, plus I’ve got blonde hair which is no good in chlorine."
760,yeah my hair it so long it will cause me much grief in the pool
760,"I agree with you on that one! I’m pretty hungry I’m thinking of pizza for breakfast, what do you think?"
760,"i love pizza , can we get pineapple on it? "
760,Me too! But pineapple on pizza?? Yuck.
760,well i hate going skiing with you but i still do dont i?
760,"Okay fine, we’ll get half pineapple, half mushroom. How dies that "
760,ok i have glasses so you better make sure its half!
760,Okay but I have glasses too!!
760,its just sometimes your not fair when it comes to dividing the pizza up
761,"That's so interesting. I have seen the Ultimate Frisbee course at the nearby park, where I go to fish. "
761,Fishing is fun too.  How often do you go fishing?
761,"Whenever I get the chance. Maybe once or twice a month, depending on how busy I am with work. "
761,Isn't it getting a little to cold now to go fishing?
761,Not at all. I find that the fish can be easier to catch when it's a little colder outside. 
761,"Oh really?  I've never tried, maybe I should get out there this weekend.  Do you have a boat?"
761,"No, I usually fish from the pier. Last time, I caught a 14"" bass. "
761,"Hey that's a keeper!  Last time I went I caught two 6 inchers, you definitely got me beat"
761,"6"" is too small to keep, isn't it? I wound up having the bass for dinner. It was delicious, cooked up with some lemon and garlic. "
761,Yea way too small.  I catch and release everything anyway.  I usually just get frozen fish from the store.
761,What do you use as bait? I usually use some chopped up squid. Works great! 
761,Live bait is best.  My favorite is spinners although I enjoy plastic worms too
762,"Very rough,being a divorced single mom makes it hard."
762,I bet single parenting is exhausting.
762,"For sure,especially with the crazy hours i work in the ER"
762,"I work lots of hours too, I end up going out to eat alot."
762,What do you do for a living?whats your favorite place to eat out?
762,I work with computers. I eat somewhere different as much as I can.
762,I actually just built a computer.
762,"Wow, by yourself? That's pretty impressive. Most people just buy them."
762,"Yep,all by myself.I saved a ton of money vs buying one pre built and after my divorce ive tried to save money anywhere i can."
762,"Nice. Building computers is cool, but building food (cooking) is a pain. "
762,Yeah it can be a royal pain.I make awesome chilli though!
762,"chili, huh. I eat out at least three times a week, I can't understand why people cook at home so much, waste of time if you ask me."
763,yes.
763,Are you gonna see each other again soon?
763,may be i will go there
763,Really? Where are you planning to go?

764,I love homemade bagels! Do you own a bakery?
764,I don't.  I do however take order from my home.  more of an at home side business
764,"That's nice. I live in rural Oklahoma, and there are quite a few home bakers, but none that make bagels. "
764,Bagel bakers are definitely no common.  Needless to say I get quite a few orders.
764,I'm sure you do! My friend from New York is always complaining about not being able to find a good bagel here. We have some amazing fry bread though!
764,Fry bread?  I'm not familiar wit that.  Sounds delicious though!
764,"It's fairly simple. Sort of like a flour tortilla with leavening, deep fried in super hot oil. We like them with taco topping or cinnamon and honey for dessert"
764,I must try fry bread!  Sounds amazing!
764,All recipes has some good recipes for it. I hope you enjoy it!
765,"Yep. I had a big celebration dinner. Of course, I eat large meals a lot haha"
765,I eat a lot of cookies.

768,just a pretty dress! it was blue
768,I bet you looked great in it.  What have you been doing to lose all that weight?
768,"the usual, just eating better and exercising"
768,"Do you ever have a ""cheat"" day?  I'm doing the same thing.  More proportion control and less snacking than exercise."
768,"i do, more often than i would like haha"
768,"Nah, its all about progress, not perfection ;)"
768,thats a good way of looking at it
768,I bet your daughter is very proud of you as much as you are of her

769,Sounds like you should do fine. Where are you from?
769,Florida. It's finally getting cooler here. Where are you from?
769,Originally from Moscow. Now I live in Minnesota 
769,Moscow! Really? So do you speak Russian?
769,"Yes. My family moved here when I was 17, but I still have a thick accent as well and that was 6 years ago"
769,"I wish I could speak another language. I can do a lot of things, but I never got the hang of speaking a foreign language."
769,Yes. English was hard for me to pick up. How old are you?
769,62. I've heard English is a hard language to learn.
769,You're the same age as my father. The hard part for me was learning the midwestern dialect 
769,I have a hard time even with American accents from other states!
769,You would struggle with my English then. My Russian accent makes me hard for others to understand
770,"Yeah but tennis is fun to me, too. "
770,whos your top tennis player of all time?
770,Serena WIlliams. 
770,isnt she italian american?

770,Acrylics. 
770,awesome my brother paints with acrylics! i prefer watercolours
770,"Oh, why?"
770,they are inexpensive and easy to wash off my clothes haha
771,"She was in a lot of older movies, like trouble in texas."
771,well you would think i would have heard of her since i live in Houston!
771,"Ha, speaking of old movies, have you seen Singing in the Rain?"
771,"No.Im either working as a waitress,or jogging in my free time.I gotta stay fir for the club i work at."
771,Jogging that's a good way to stay fit and get some time outside. I like being outside when it is raining.
771,Me too! Jogging in the rain is refreshing! I prefer that to sitting watching tv any day.
771,"Sorry for the slow responses, sometimes I wish my computer would work a little faster."
771,They are pretty easy to upgrade.I recently added ram to mine.Huge difference!
771,Maybe I'll have to look into that. How much ram did you add?
771,i went from 4 gb to 16 gb.Its like a whole new computer now.

772,That's terrible. Do you have anyone to help you at home? 
772, My wife is at home. But work is hurting since I'm not there.
772,"Did you file charges against the store? Maybe you can get them to at least cover medical bills, if not your lost wages."
772,Nah.  It was an accident.  I don't blame them.  They didn't know it was there. 
772,I'm sorry that happened to you. Maybe they will be more careful next from now on. I would hate to have that happen to others.
772,Accidents happen.  They didn't intentionally poor water.  The workers and manager were incredibly kind.  They actually sent flowers and have called and checked on me!
772,Maybe you can order groceries for delivery like I do. I hate carrying my groceries on the bus.
772,That's an excellent idea.  I have never use that service before.  Will have to try.
772,"It's worth it even if there is a fee, but you can find coupon codes online most of the time. "
772,I don't usually do the shopping.  My wife tends to do the majority since I work all the time.  I'll ask her though!
772,She has her work cut out for her with your injury. It would be a nice break for her.
773,"What do you like to do outside? Kayaking, hiking. etc.?"
773,"Im more of a nature type, although it changes some time."
773,"So you don't like the outdoors all the time, then"

774,I have two dogs
774,"I love to walk my dog, pretty much every day. how about you"
774,"Yes, taking the dogs on hikes is really relaxing"

775,"about 6 i believe , i lost track after my 3rd"
775,Haha. Are they big boats or small boats?
775,Not too big but you should see the size of the poop.
775,"HA, do they have big poop decks?"
775,Yep! I need big ones because I’m secretly a cannibal 
775,So you lure people on your boat to eat them?!
775,Yes I have acquired a long-standing reputation as cannibal in my area. And people do not want to talk to me!
775,Yeah well it is scary if you are afraid of being eaten!

776,Its 1998 and it has 100k miles 
777,"It's a brand new dodge, I bought it after my fourth divorce, but before I got married again."
777,"Wow that's awesome. I have a Dodge Ram, it's a van from 1993. Fixed it up and it works really nice."
777,"The old Dodges really hold up well, they take some work, but they will last."
777,it sure helped me get through my tough long divorce
777,Did you have to live in it at all after the divorce? I ended up living in the bar I own in Chacago for a while after one divorce.
777,no my father in law had to pay for us
777,For you to do what?
777,For us a place to live for a while.
777,"Oh, I see. Sounds like he must be a nice guy."
777,He sure is.
777,I've had some good fater in laws and some who were not very nice throughout my many marriges and divorces. Are you doing better now?
777,So far so good. I am much happier now.
778,It was always just a game my family played in the backyard at the farm.
778,"Cool, I am surprised it is not more popular. It is really exciting to watch. what sport do you enjoy most?"
778,"Aside from badminton, I like ice skating."
778,I used to enjoy watching ice skating. I don't follow it so much any more because it seems like the backstage drama has taken over
778,That's true. What sport do you enjoy?
778,I enjoy watching soccer alot. It's interesting to see the differences between soccer in the US and in Europe and south america. Different styles of play.
778,It truly is. We didn't see much soccer in the US when I was young. It has become more popular.
778,I listened to a podcast about this very thing recently. It started to pick up when the US hosted the 1994 World Cup..
778,That sounds about right. I was excited to watch the Women's teams this year.
778,"Me too! unfortunatley the rules governing highschool soccer are holding us players back from being as good as they are in Europe, where they play club soccer year round."
778,I didn't know the rules were different. That's not fair! Players should not be held back from their sport.
778,"Yeah, the HS rules keep players from being able to play year round. But one day we will be as good as they are, I know."
779,I watched that season!
779,"The early seasons were the best! She was so good on it, and is such a real person."
779,They were.  She became one of my favorite country singres
779,I'm from Oklahoma so she was a big deal for our state. We've made lots of country music stars.
779,Vince Gill is my all time favorite!From Oklahoma!!!
779,"Yes, he's good! Reba will always hold a little piece of my heart, and Garth Brooks is just legendary."
779,Love them both!  Never saw Reba in concert.  Have seen Garth ad Vince several times. 
779,"She plays at the casino in my hometown quite often, so I've seen her a few times. I'm an accountant for them so i get tickets cheap!"
779,That's amazing.  She seems like a fantastic person.  She is someone I would love to meet.  I know so many of her songs.
779,"She's is very nice. She runs a non-profit rehab facility for elderly people, and my grandmother stayed there after she broke her hip."
779,Another reason to love her!  I love when celebrities use their money for good.  Truly selfless.
779,It's always great to see people use their fame to help others. We need more people like that in the world.
780,do you have any grandchildren?
780,I do not have any grandchildren. I have a boyfriend that I have lived with for about five years.

784,"Yeah, I really hope I can serve people like that in the future"
784,"I am sure you will, it takes a special person to be a nurse!"
784,yeah and honestly the pay as a paramedic was terrible so as a nurse I will make more and be able to take better care of my family
784,"I have a good friend who is a nurse and is paid very well, she tells me of how hard nurses work."

786,I like to browse thrift stores.
786,Nice.  Do you buy things and resell?  I sometimes do that.

788,Is making youtube vids your hobby or a money making venture?
788,"It started as a hobby, but now I'm going to try to make money with that platform."

788,"But you can do make-up, that's a talent in itself! What is your fav look to do when going out?"
788,I don't really have a favorite look. I just like to experiment with the colors.
788,"Oooh, like 80's glam? That was a lot of colours."
788,"Yes, it was. That was the only thing good about the 80's, ha ha."
788,"Ha. There were some good books written back then, but you can't tell when they were written, no garish colours."

792,"Aww, there's someone out there for you too! Don't feel bad, some people just meet their person sooner."
792,That's very true. Maybe I will find me a fellow rock enthuisiast. What kind of music do you enjoy?

792,I'm the same way. Do you have a favorite rock artist?
792,Linkin Park and Offspring

792,"I know, I cried and listened to One More Light for like two days"
792,It was very upsetting. It's sad how common suicide really is. I was really upset about Chris Cornell too
792,It's horrible how it seems to be a growing epidemic. 
792,I agree. I hope we can find a way to help everyone who struggles

793,Do you happen to play any other instruments?
793,"yes, I'm a guitar player"
793,I've always wanted to play the guitar. I'm a highschool band teacher and I play the sax.
793,How do you feel towards the saxophone?
793,The instrument itself can sound very good and put you in the mood like jazz and at the same time it can be funny.
793,I really do enjoy Jazz occasionally.
793,Do you have any hobbies that you do weekly?
793,I do have activities I do for enjoyment. My favorite is golf.

793,We should meet up one day so we can do yoga together then!
793,"yes , that would be quite wonderful !"
794,"No, I do not like to take any medications."
794,Sometimes medication can work but you have to be careful because some side effects of drugs can affect physical diseases.
794,"Yes, I have heard of that and it bothers me."

794,I would want to research any that are advised as I am a very healthy person.
794,I really understand your concern.
794,Do you agree that exercise can help when having problems?
794,Yes. Any type of physical exercise will help you maintain fitness and overall health and wellness.
794,"Its is nice to have someone to talk to about any problems but, I do want to keep up my exercise routines."
794,That will really help you to maintain your overall health.
794,How do you feel about healthy eating habits?
794,I think healthier food items is a great idea. I've been eating healthier lately. The term 
795,I drove my ford truck all the way to the Appalachian mountains 
795,That sounds amazing. The appalachian mountains are a place that i would like to go and paint.
795,I am going there to go camping next week.  It should be a fun time.
795,I camp alot. I take my watercolours with me and paint all the beautiful things I see. Where else do you camp?
795,"I have been to many places to camp, but usually just the mountains.  I have been camping in the mountains with all 3 of my wives."
795,"The mountains are such a beautiful place to camp. I love the blue of the sky above the mountains, it is my favourite colour."
795,Yes it can be quite pretty.  I like the orange sky of the sunset more.
795,"Sunset is a gorgeous combinations of colours. The oranges, blues, purples, reds and yellows are mind-blowing sometimes."
796,I just read Catcher In the Rye.  Ever heard of it?
796,I have! It is a dystopian novel published in 1949 by English author George Orwell
796,Oh no silly.  You are thinking of 1984.  Catcher in the Rye is by JD Salinger.  Sound familair?
796,"ohhh youre right, that's the one about the guy who appreciates solitude. I read it in highschool"
796,Now you got it.  Have you read any other good books lately?
796,yes I have
796,Oh please do tell.  What was a name of one?
796,"I did read george orwells 1984, what a disturbing yet interesting read"
796,oh yes.  I just saw that movie too.  Imagine living in a world like that.  Oh the humaity!!!
796,I never saw the movie - was it true to the book?
796,pretty close.  Its not as good though
796,well its hard to fit so much content into a movie. Would you recommend it?
796,nice talking to you
797,How are you able to resist steak if you love it so much?
797,"Well, there are a lot of tasty steak alternatives, like tempeh and grain-based veggie meats"
797,I have always been curious about those. Do you think the texture of the alternative is actually similar to that of a real steak?
797,"It's not exactly the same, but some of the newer brands are getting pretty close. What do you like to eat?"
797,"Everything, pretty much. I love animals in general, but I also love food, so it's pretty difficult. Fruit is my favorite snack."
797,"I understand the dilemma! Fruit i a great snack, though. The guy who plays guitar in a band I'm in is obsessed with pomegranate"
797,"Pomegranate is awesome! People ask me if I'm in a band all the time, probably because I have tattoo sleeves. I play piano, but not very well. :P "
797,"Oh wow, really?  You're not thinking of travaling to Japan are you?  They might mistake you for a yakuza.  Yakuza have sleeve tattoos as well."
797,"I've never heard of yakuza, but I will definitely look them up and see! I would love to go to Japan one day, though. Such a beautiful and exciting country."
797,"Same here! I've actually never been to another country, but I'd love to visit Japan or Africa one day."
797,"Same here, I also think Spain would be interesting to visit. Language barriers would be terrifying though."
797,"Yeah, they would! I only took a year of Spanish in college and never got very far. Do you speak any other languages?"
798,I like to listen to audio books when I'm not working. What's your favorite book or author?
798,I like Stephen King and classics.
798,I have listened to a lot of Stephen King. It is fun to get into a story since I'm not able to go out of the house.
798,He definitely has an imagination.
798,Are you working today? I have to take a break for a few days due to some health problems.
798,"I am working today, Monday morning, the start of a new week."
798,"Since I work from home, I make my own hours most of the time. Sometimes I work all weekend. It depends how I feel."
798,That sounds like a nice balance. Do you enjoy your own work?
798,"The work is a little monotonous, but I am glad I am able to continue to work from home despite being bed ridden."
798,That is a major advantage of working from home.
798,"Do you have to commute to work? The traffic in my city is terrible, so that's another perk of working at home."
798,Yes I have to commute and it is terrible.
799,Being the middle child has its advantages and disadvantages
799,I guess I missed out on all that haha
799,My siblings usually like to eat all of my sweets
799,Maybe you should hide them
799,I have tried to but they always find them
799,Have you tried talking to your parents about the problem?
799,"Yes, they just find it funny"
799,Maybe ask them for more money to buy more sweets then you can get some more or they will stop your siblings from eating the original sweets
799,"In order for my parents to give me money, I have to do chores around the house."
799,Get your siblings to help you and then make a deal that they get some of the sweets that way they don't have to steal yours
799,"I have tried that, but they just take whatever they want."
799,Sounds like you have some terrible siblings
800,No way! I wouldn't record myself
800,that would be good to do . you should try to look it up on youtube
800,"Maybe, I don't know though. The internet can be a cruel place"
800,yeah but there are a lot of programs that help!
800,Do you know any?
800,There's websites like skillshare that can help you. I could also help you if you would like!
800,That's okay. Maybe I'll check that one out later
800,"well , keep singing and best of luck !"
800,"Thank you! Who knows, maybe I'll actually get somewhere"
800,"you will ! as long as you work hard at it , you will get there ! That's what I did!"
800,It worked out for you?
800,It did! That's the first thing that came to mind right before pulling it; 
801,"I have to go in early and take it again, but I only get one chance. I got lucky she said I could retake it."
801,I hope it goes better this time. Math is definitely not my favorite subject. I would rather be mushroom hunting with my paps.
801,Mushroom hunting? That sounds interesting. What exactly is it?
801,"There is a specific kind I like to look for, and pick. They are really nice when you fry them up. Do you have any hobbies?"
801,That is really interesting. Fried mushrooms are really good. I enjoy listening to and reviewing rock music. 
801,That sounds really cool. Do you have any favorite rock musicians
801,My favorite rock band is Led Zeppelin. Jimmy Page is the best guitarist ever. Do you like any music?
801,"I am a huge fan of rock myself. Actually, Zeppelin is my favorite band also. It's tough to beat Robert Plant on vocals"
801,NICE! Robert Plant's vocals are amazing! What is your favorite Zeppelin song?
801,That's a tough one. I think I would choose Kashmir though. How about yours?
801,Kashmir is amazing. Mine always changes based off my mood. Right now my favorite is Going to California.
801,"Another great, classic. They have so many great songs. Not a single bad one in my opinion."
802,Wow.  I didn't know that.  Do you know a lot about music history?
802,I actually took a couple courses of music history in college.
802,Interesting.  What did you major in?
802,"I majored in music, and history actually. Now I work at a bank, so definitely putting those majors to use. What about you?"
802,"i majored in eduction, I also work at a bank."
802,Thats funny. What do you do at the bank?
802,I am a lender
802,Very nice! I work in the deposit department
802,very nice! do you play any instruments?
802,no i am not good with instruments !
802,neither am i
802,What is your favorite type of music?
803,agreed
803,Celebrating a loved ones birthday is so important!
803,"i think so too, its too bad so many people live paycheck to paycheck though =["
803,Yes we all have to do our best and just the thought of remembering your birthday is great!
803,right! i understand if he cant make it
803,Hopefully there will lots of pictures and videos taken for memories.
803,maybe we can go though pictures on one of his days off or plan something with just him
803,That's a great idea you could have a lot of one on one conversations that way.
803,i would prefer that instead of bouncing around to everyone else
803,"I know what you  mean, on my last birthday party I had a small group of people for dinner."
803,that sounds amazing...im not a fan of large groups
803,"It so interesting to get to know people on a more personal manner, it feels more sincere."
804,It's also hard with my allowance. I'm only ten years old
804,"At 10 you shouldn't have to donate to charity, I'm already in university (UMass) studying Philosophy, and money is tight for me too."
804,It was for one of my friends. I have a lot of friends
804,"You are lucky that you have alot of friends. I don't have time for friends right now, but maybe later."
804,What is philosophy?
804,It is kindof studying and thinking about life and why it is the way it is. Confusing I know.
804,I don't get it. But I also don't get math 
804,"Math is hard for me too, that's why I'm not studying it in Uni. What do you like in school?"
804,I like to read a lot. Me and all my friends do
804,"I read alot too, I think my brown eyes are best for reading, my brothers eyes are blue and he doesn't read much."
804,My eyes are green
804,Do the rest of your family have green eyes too?
805,"I'm not sure if she does, but gosh do I wish people were better drivers. People seemed to be a lot more apt at driving in the UK than here."
805,"I haven't been driving for long enough to tell, but I'm sure you're right. Is your mom hurt though?"
805,"Oh yeah, she's fine. It was just a fender bender. You'll see in time, I'm sure. How long have you been driving?"
805,I'm really happy to hear she is alright. Only for a few months! Finally passed my driving exams.
805,Oh wow! Have any crazy scenarios happen to you yet? How's your parallel parking skills?
805,There was actually a lady driving on the wrong side of the road yesterday morning! She scared me!
805,"What?! That's crazy! How do these people get their licences? Heck, maybe *she* was from the UK!"
805,"Ha, I wouldn't be surprised if she was! I actually have it on dash cam. Are you coming over this weekend? I'll show you!"
805,"Oh wow, good thing! You should think about reporting them then. Did we make plans? I totally forgot "
805,"Like to the police? No worries, I'll give you a call later to make plans"
805,"Yeah absolutely, that kind of reckless driving shouldn't go unwarned. "
805,"Ok, I'll be sure to head to the police station with a copy of the video tonight. Cops intimidate me though haha"
806,Her birthday was yesterday and I was too busy with work. She was upset that I forgot her birthday.
806,"Well you can always get more flowers, so it'll be okay! Try making it up by bringing her food!"
806,I have a dinner date at a fancy place she loves planned tonight. So I hope it goes well. How are you?
806,its going okay. I have a few dates a month. trying to take it slow to be honest. No one seems different though.
806,Well keep at it. You will find someone for you. What are your hobbies?
806,I love acting. It's always been my dream to play the big roles in films.
806,That is really cool! What is your favorite type of acting?
806,"I usually like fantasy movies.  You know I get enough of the real world, so I'd like to see something fantastical to dive into people's imaginations."
806,I agree 100% with that. Escaping from the real world is always nice. What do you like to eat?
806,mac and cheese ! especially in the shape of dinosaurs .
806,Aw. That is cute. I like eating meat. Steak is my favorite. Do you like steak?
806,"I do, but I would rather eat other stuff now. Steak without qualification is considered beefsteak!"
807,Football mainly.
807,football is nice . i am more of a reader than a sports person
807,Me too actually. 
807,What sort of things do you enjoy reading?
807,Stories about near death experiences. 
807,"That is pretty scary, is it life reaffirming for you?"
807,Yes indeed. 
807,"I enjoy fantasy myself, takes me to wild places."
807,Well this stuff really happened though. 
807,"Yeah I don't like to read about real life, I already live in real life!"
807,That's a good point. 
807,"I'm glad you do though, people like being heard!"
808,Maybe one day I will move to London. 
808,Wouldn't that be great. Think of all the changes we could make.
808,Yep. And the soccor!
808,I guess you'll have to get a storage unit.  The question then is what goes in the storage unit?  Furniture or the kids crafts.  Haha.
808,Just furniture probably. 
808,"I live with my mom. If we moved, I would have to deal with her 500 pairs of shoes. She's a hoarder for sure."
808,OH wow that's a lot of shoes. 
808,"500 pairs of shoes is definitely way too many.  If she was unwilling to discard the items and the shoes were covering up living areas, I would hate it."
808,I agree.
808,I have to be careful travelling to new countries though. I am allergic to shellfish and cats.
808,There are cats everywhere. 
808,Oh wow. I would have to avoid them. Do you have pets?
809,"I just wish I could have gone farther in archery, you know?"
809,You can learn eventually. How come you stopped?
809,Kids are expensive.
809,"I don't have any myself, but I can only imagine. How many kids do you have?"
809,"Just a daughter. I must admit, I spoil her."
809,That's fantastic. Do you plan on having more kids eventually? Nothing wrong with spoiling.
809,"I would love to have more kids, actually. What about you? Any plans of having children?"
809,"I would love to one day. My girlfriend wants 5, but i'm thinking that's too many personally. lol "
809,"Oh my gosh, that would be a lot of work! I don't think I could have that many, personally, but to each their own!"
809,"I think two is the perfect number. I grew up with one brother, and that worked out well I think. haha. How many would you like to have?"
809,"Not sure, honestly. I grew up with two sisters and a brother, and I thought that was a good number as well. Maybe I'm partial because I'm number 3."
809,They say the third time is the charm. You must be the favorite child
809,Definitely ;)
810,I have heard they have a big swimming pool there.
810,Really? How big is it?
810,I think they used it in the Olympics so it must be pretty big!
810,"Wow! I love to run but have never been very good at swimming, I would like to get better."
810,"It takes a lot of practice, I love swimming. How often do you run?"
810,"Every day, its an important part ofmy routine. Do you run?"
810,I have done in the past but have fallen out of the habit. I should really start again.
810,"You should, it feels great and is amazing for your health"
810,We moved when my parents split up and I haven't looked for routes around my new house. Maybe I'll go for a run tomorrow morning!
810,I think that's a great idea!Make sure you stretch first!
810,"Haha yeah, don't want to get injured on my first run!"
810,"Yeah, you probably better. And just start slow on the small hills."
811,I always try my best.
811,That is sweet!
811,"Yeah, being comfortable around another person is so relaxing."
811,It is! Do you have children?
811,"Yes, I have two children 8 and 10."
811,Oh wonderful! Boys or Girls?
812,"I have picked up a few, I'm just hoping they start working soon."
812,what kind of meds? something like xanax?
812,"Just general painkillers, mainly ibuprofen for now. It should help numb the pain until I can schedule a dentist appointment."
812,that should work.  I never go to the dentist because I am afraid to talk to them.
812,What do you find fearful about dentists?
812,"I don't find dentists scary specifically, I find everyone scary because I have autism  "
812,"Ah, that's fair, I assure you people are not as bad as they seem, I've never personally ran into an issue with any medical staff before."
812,"Yes I am sure it would be fine, I just find them intimidating "
812,"Everyone gets a bit worried when talking to certain people, a smile can usually go a long way though."
813,How long have you been cooking?
813,It's been about 5 years now. I've learned so much since I first started.
813,Interesting...what inspired you to start cooking
813,"I started as a way to keep in shape, especially since it requires a lot of strength, endurance, and flexibility."
813,Yes it does. I have slowed down over the years but I still cherish my fresh vegetables.
813,What meats and vegetables do you like?
813,"I love brocolli, carrots, chicken, and fish. What about you?"
813,"Yeah, broccoli is the best vegetable. I really love to eat it raw as well."
813,Me too!... dip it in ranch and enjoy!
813,I love ranch dressing too. It is my favorite to dip with. It has been the best selling salad dressing in the US since 1992.
813,That's an interesting fact. I wonder what people used before ranch became so popular...
813,probably something bland
813,I agree. I can't imagine raw broccolli without ranch
814,"That's great, I should mention that when selling mine at the market"
814,"Yes, beetroot has many benefits, I juice mine with apples and carrots daily and love it!"
814,That sounds really good. Do you ever add any spices or anything?
814,"Not really mostly lemons, kale or greens of some kind."
814,"I could never put kale in it, but I'd like to try adding lemons"
814,"You really can't taste the kale, as the kale has calcium and great benefits as well as the beetroot."
814,"No kale for me, but if you enjoy it that's great!"
814,"lol, to each there own I have heard beetroot is good for the kidneys?"
814,"Yeah, probably helps circulation quite a bit. "
814,"I bet, I know when cutting it up it can stain easily."
814,"Super easily. You can boil beets to dye fabric though, which is pretty cool"
814,"I've heard of that as well with makeup, lol"
815,"I have a few blue tang, which is fun. My niece loves Finding Nemo"
815,i love kids movies . i like finding nemo !
816,I'm sorry? 
816,I think that was a typo.  What did you study in college?
816,"Well when I started, I studied typing, but that was almost forty years ago!"
816,I didn't know that typing was a college major. We finally got some cool weather here. I'm happy because winter is my favorite season.
816,Are you getting any snow soon where you are?
816,Nah. I live in the south. We rarely get snow. I'm glad though because we can't ski. I'm so afraid of heights.
816,"I am sorry to hear that, I love snow. It's flat where I live, so no skiing here either."
816,What do you like to do in your spare time? Have you ever traveled to a National Park?
816,"No, I always mean to. In my spare time, I like to travel, went to DC most recently for museums. "
816,I love the museum of National History. Did you see Dorothy's shoes?
816,"I mostly wound up at the human exhibits through time, I did not get to see the shoes. A shame, I grew up in kansas."
816,Oh really. Are you a Les Miles fan?
817,yes i will support
817,same
817,yes thanks
817,No problem I hope everything works out
817,ok thanks i will support
817,good
817,thanks work nice
817,I really am serious about this sport and I hope to go far with it. 
818,I'm not sure maybe order some chinese food and find a good book.
818,You could learn to cook chinese food. New experiences are always good.
818,"I could do that, and surprise her with my new skill when she comes home."
818,I'm sure she'll love it! What type of books are you into?
818,Mysteries mostly.  You?
818,"I love mysteries, but lately I've been reading the Berenstain Bears books, at the insistence of my child! They're illustrated children's novels like those in the "
818,My children love those.  Such good lessons in each.
818,"I agree, the mysteries are great! It's also nice how the author can either stick to facts or be highly speculative. Makes for some varied reading."
818,"Very true, however I believe technology has ruined the modern mystery,"
818,How do you think technology has ruined the modern mystery?
818,much less leg work and creative thinking.  
818,Good point. Do you do anything creative?
819,i have had a traumatic experience where i fell off of a fishing boat once
819,That's so sad! I'm sorry it happened. What do you do for work?
819,Currently i'm a production floor factory worker
819,That's cool. I'm trying to open my own grocery store
819,That's very entrepreneurial of you. Where are you going to open it ? 
819,I hope by the end of the year
819,i'd like to venture into my own business one day
819,It's hard but rewarding. I have some challenges like being color blind
820,what company?
820,It is with the Disney Corporation.
820,that sounds like a wise investment
820,"True, I'm not one to take many risks."
820,"maybe i should invest too, it might help me get through casino manager school"
820,"That sounds interesting, how much longer do you have to go?"
820,6 more years to go
820,"Oh wow, is it very hard?"
820,"not really, i count cards for four hours straight"
820,"Oh really, I bet you are great in math?"
820,i like to think so
820,Well good luck to you and any investments you make!
820,thank you!...you as well..do you have any tips?
821,"Haha, I'm sure they do. So, what do you like to do for fun?"
821,"My number on passion is photography.  But, I try to just have a lot of fun regardless of what I do."
821,"Thats awesome, and the best way to live life. I love playing tennis, but I'm not all that great at it, if I'm honest."
821,Tennis is a hard sport. There is so much running.
821,"Surprisingly, yes. For such a little area, you sure do run a lot."
821,I try to run a 10K each year.  What is your favorite color?
821,I love the color blue. What's your favorite?
821,Really! That's my favorite as well.
821,"Thats awesome! Do you own your own place, or do you rent?"
821,We are working on paying off our mortgage. You?
821,"Same, actually. Cheaper than renting an apartment, and I can sing as loud and obnoxiously as I want to."
821,What kind of music do you like?
822,"Yeah. When I play fortnite when I come back from the elementary school, little Tux comes and sits on my lap, it's adorable!"
822,"Aww, how cute. I want to meet your little fluffers. I bet she is a great companion and is good at aiding you."
822,You can come over this weekend. I'm sure they'll love you! Do you have any pets?
822,"I do, a cat! Over the last few decades in Japan, we've started to adopt pets as more than utilitarian and more into our family system."
822,"Oh wow! What color is it? Also, what does utilitarian mean?"
822,It's black. Utilitarian means being more useful than appearance. 
822,Oh ok! I'll try and include that one in my next short story for my teacher. It must be very pretty! Can you show me a picture later?
822,I would love to but we can't share images on here :(
822,Aww that's okay I understand :( Do you play any games?
822,Yes I do! I build all my computers and deck it out with the latest hardware to play minecraft
822,Really?! That is so cool! I wish my parents would let me have my own computer. They think it would a bad influence.
822,It can but it can also help you out on academics as well. It's like a double edged sword.
823,"I think I did really well, i knew all of the right stuff to pass."
823,that's great i'm glad to hear it
823,I do however think I eat to much meat. I should probably try to eat less meat since it is not great for the environment.
823,"I have so many questions about thie segue, your bar exam certification got you thinking about yor meat consumption?"
823,"it made me think about a lot of environmental problems that are going on right now and meat consumption is a big one, at least on an individual level."
823,How did it do that? Was there an ethical question component or something? 
823,There is a part that looks at your character and it just got me thinking of a lot of different things about myself.
823,"I think systemically we ought to be pushing to address more dire environmental impacts instead of compartmentalizing small dietary choices, hoping they have the scale necessary"
823,Well with most of the current administration being climate deniers i do think anything is going to change very soon.
823,"Well, hopefully with smart educated minds like yours entering the law profession we can change that - and soon. I'm excited about the impact of EVs!"
823,Yeah I think a Tesla is my dream car at this point. 
823,More a corevette for me! I would give anything for an electric corvette - something like that would just make my life utterly complete. 
824,"I am a professional poker player,  I like to read to my cats in my freetime "
824,"I am not good at poker, but I do like to play for fun."
824,I like to use my poker winnings to buy tuna.  It's my favorite food.
824,"That's interesting! I wish I could have tuna, but I'm allergic. What else do you buy?"
824,"I like to buy things for my cats,  other than that I just pay my bills and play more poker"
824,You have some lucky kitties! Have cat food prices gone up? Dog food prices are ridiculous!
824,Yes my cat has to eat science diet food as well so it is especially expensive
824,That is an expensive food. I guess you win a lot of money playing poker?
824,I make a decent amount average is around 20-30 dollars an hour
824,I wish I could make that kind of money. That could get you a lot where I'm from.
824,Yes it is quite the fortunate position to be in.
824,Do you play poker online to make that money?
825,I prefer sirloin. What about yourself? I also am prone to demanding my meat rare. I want to hear it moo. 
825,I'm a prime rib kind of guy myself. I like my steak medium though. I had it rare once and it made me sick
825,"Oh, sorry to hear that! It isn't for everyone, I guess. So what do you do for a living? Or are you in school?"
825,Unfortunately I'm not working right now. But I plan on going back to school in the spring what about you?
825,Are you majoring in anything in particular?
825,I'm trying to get a cybersecurity certification actually.  I don't have the cash for a 4 year school but computers pay out big!
825,So I've heard. My boyfriend is into computers. I'm a little clueless myself. What is cybersecurity?
825,I guess the best way to put it is to say its like the protection of networks. Keep people out that need to be out
825,"That sounds cool, actually. Have you ever been hacked? That is one experience I don't want to have again."
825,I was on facebook a few years back. Aside from that no. My parents have been hacked a few times though
825,"Is that part of the reason why you're interested in cybersecurity? As long as I never get my identity stolen, I won't complain. "
825,Of course! people put so much information online and I want to help protect it
826,We have a chocolate factory in the town where i leave. I think it feeds my love of chocolate.
826,Have you ever had the seeds from the cacao tree? Before they are processed they are pretty bitter and are fermented before being processed into chocolate.
826,No I have not. Where do you purchase them?
826,they came to argentina where i am from and i met them in a drugstore .
826,You met who in a drugstore?
826,"Sorry, I got the cacao seeds there."
826,Ah I see. I've never seen them in a drug store around here. I will ask my twin sister though. She works at a drug store.
826,"If you can't find them locally, you can always find them online."
826,That's a good idea. I do a lot of shopping on amazon. Have you started Christmas shopping yet?
826,"No, but I need to get started.  Have you?"
826,"Yes, I have a few people done already. I still have a lot left though."
826,"We still have plenty of time, but it goes by fast this time of year."
827,I know! The memories can be really sweet!
827,Do you get to see your mom often?
827,"Not often, she lives far away"
827,"sO SAD,  i DON'T KNOW WHAT i WOULD DO WITHOUT MY MOTHER HERE."
827,Really? You two are close?
827,We are very close
827,Has it always been like that for you two?
827,"Yes, but even more so once I had kids of my own."
827,So she helps a lot?
827,Oh yes and my kids adore her. They call her fairy Grandmother
827,Thats so cute!!! How many kids do you have?
827,2.  Do you hve any?
828,What is your favorite song of his?
828,"Oh, man, that's tough. I guess today my answer would be Dear Mama."
828,"I'll have to look that one up. I like listening to new music, expanding my horizons."
828,We need more musicians like him - he was really about the music. There's way too much commercial garbage on the radio these days.
828,"That's so true. Aside from Tupac, who is your favorite artist?"
828,"I've got pretty diverse taste. It's hard to pin down a favorite. Lately I've been listening to a lot of Johnny Cash, though."
828,"He's such a classic. As I've gotten older, I appreciate his music even more."
828,Absolutely. His voice is legendary.
828,"So distinctive. His version of ""Hurt"" always gives me goosebumps."
828,"It's a great one. I like how he managed to stay relevant up until the day he died. His life story is inspiring, too."
828,"Yes, it is. He seemed to be a good man - he knew he wasn't perfect, but he tried his best."
828,He did. I like stories like that - people who aren't perfect but do the best they can.
829,What's your favorite kind of beer?
829,"I like IPA, they are usually better in bottles though,"
829,I agree. I prefer glass bottles over cans for any drink.
829,"Same, but cans are useful at the beach or really any outdoor function that isn't in someone's backyard."
829,That's true.
829,I wouldn't mind being on a beach with a drink in hand. This colder weather is already bumming me out.
829,I usually don't mind the cold weather too much until it starts to snow.
829,I really only like the cold weather because of snow.
829,"I don't mind the snow, I just don't like driving in it"
829,The right tires makes all the difference. 
829,Also a vehicle with moderate ground clearance doesn't hurt either.
829,True and a capable driver. 
830,"Well, I stopped eating it at first because of the taste, but the ethics makes me even happier with my decision."
830,same
830,"Have you ever read ""Eating Animals""? It's a great book and had me thinking a lot. It's about the animal agriculture industry."
830,I actually have! I am a big advocate against animal cruelty.
830,Oh that's great! Me too. I want to get involved with local activism.
830,I agree. More people should get involved to make a change.
830,"Yeah, I agree. I think most people care, but they just don't know how to help."
830,There not a lot we can do.Maybe presure the local politicians
830,That's true. Anything helps. It's hard to change something that has been the same for so many years.
830,If we could just get more people on board to do that we would be on the right track.
830,"I agree! I always like to share what I know with other people, but some people get upset when they hear about the cruelty behind meat."
830,its graphic but needs to be known
831,what was that like?
831,It was very tiring at first but I got the hang of it and it's really relaxing.
831,"good to hear, what do you do in it?"
831,I meditate and try to get the life energy to flow within me. This eases me.
831,sounds pleasant. i wish i had the time to relax as such.
831,just being aware of the moment is a kind of meditation . helps calm the spirit .
831,"thanks for the advice, i'll make good use of it in the future. what do you like to do in your free time?"
831,I really like just being able to escape to a different world.
831,have you ever had any interesting experiences doing so?
831,Yea! This one time I traveled to Japan and had a shiba dog companion.
831,i love shibas! did anything happen during that Japan trip?
831,I explored the city of Tokyo and was in awe at how much tech was around me. Also the ramen was good.
832,It is making me want some just thinking about it!
832,You should - there are loads of recipes online and it tastes so much better than store bought
832,"I want to make some too, I have heard adding a little shortening with the butter helps."
832,"Butter? I need to try that, I'm just using cheese and chopped vegetables."
832,"lol, in chocolate chip cookies, that would be different?"
832,"Gotta keep it interesting, y’know?  My secret patented recipe: (no) cauliflower and chedder cookies. Gave ‘em out at halloween. Kids hated them - what do they know?"
832,"Funny, I bet they were shocked!"
833,That's why I never eat fast food. A sandwich is easier to find and easier to know what is in it.
833,"I feel the same, I have high standards for my food and what I pay for, but fast food is so convenient."
833,"It is, but that isn't always a good thing. Being filled with preservatives makes it cheap and easy to get to."
833,ok no problem
833,"I understand its not for everyone, I don't really judge for eating fast food, I just know its not for me."
833,"I feel the same, I have high standards for my food and what I pay for, but convenience wins "
833,"I usually make a giant salad that I can store for days, if you keep it mostly dry, makes it easier to choose."
833,"I will have to start doing that, i need to take control of my appearence"
833,"As an athlete, that's one of the most important things, controlling appearance and doing whats good for my body."
833,"Exactly, looks are not the only think that matter in this world. but id so like to feel prettier"
833,I understand. It's hard to feel good about yourself already in this world. I am sure you are still beautiful!
833,thank you ! need to appreciate and never take life for granted. i'm going to start making salads
833,I am proud of you!
833,You too! Thanks! was nice having this
834,"Really, is that so? Interesting."
834,"""cooking healthy meals taking long time."""
834,"I agree, it can take a long time but it is worth the time for your health"
834,"""agreed."""
834,I'm glad you think so. What do you like to cook?
834,I enjoy Grilled meat and vegies
834,Me too! My favorite is zucchini
834,"I Love Grilled Chicken, Pineapple and Bell Pepper"
834,I also like those - how do you spice them?
834,"usally add salt , Red pepper and lemon juice"
834,that sounds amazing
834,mm.... Do you know any other healthy recipe
835,I find that soaking it in buttermilk before breading and frying are best
835,That actually sounds really good. I like mine hot so I season it heavily with spices. I might try soaking it though
835,Cajun spices in the batter are excellent!
835,Absolutely. Can't have good chicken without it. Sometimes I use dijon if its all I have
835,i'll have to try that.
835,Go for it. I try to read up on more vegetarian recipes because my fiance is a vegetarian and its kind of hard
835,yikes.  i cannot imagine!
835,Well she's a solid cook so she'll still make chicken and sausage for me sometimes. Some of the fake meat is good too!
835,"i have had fake hotdogs before, they were disgusting.  I couldn't get past the smell."
835,That's funny because I just had some last night and loved the smell lol Have you tried the impossible beef?
835,"no, is it made of tofu?"
835,Nope. It's plant based and it tastes just like ground beef 
836,Interesting.. do you collect old records?
836,I haven't bought any myself but my dad has a ton of polyvinyl chloride phonograph records.
836,"Wow, that's so cool! I love looking through old things, especially when they belonged to my parents."
836,"Yep, most of them come from my grandfather's collection, so they're pretty old"
836,Very neat. Maybe they will be passed down to you in the future.
836,"I already have some of them, but I need to get a turntable to play them"
836,Do you need a special type of turntable or can you use anything?
836,"Any turntable, as long as it can play the old 78 RPM's lol :)"
836,"You seem to know a lot about it. I have a lot of old records, but they are very dirty and don't play well. Maybe they just need cleaned."
836,"It's quite easy to clean them - you just need some cleaning fluid, a nice lint free cloth and some time :)"
836,I should give that a try then! Thanks for the information.
836,You're welcome :) Hope you get some good listening out of your cleaning efforts :)
837,I am a mortician so I don't have many friends.
837,Wow...how is the mortician life
837,Its lonely and a bit sad. I talk to dead people all day. They don't talk back. What do you do?
837,I work with abused children so lack of sleep makes me need coffee
837,sounds like we both work in depressing industries. I always need my morning cup of coffee. I once knocked over a cup on a dead body.
837,Tragic!!! Good thing they couldn't feel it...how did you react
837,Chortled to myself. Luckily the outfit the family had provided hadn't been put on yet.
837,That would have been all bad. Can you imagine explaining that to the grieving family?
837,I couldn't imagine. I probably would have just had the outfit dry cleaned fast! DO you have any hobbies?
837,My hobby is catching up on missed rest and tv shows
837,"Let me guess, you like to watch The Office?"
837,Not at all...more like impractical jokers
838,i love camping!
838,It is so fun. I love being able to show my kids different parts of the country.
838,where have you gone so far?
838,We love the mountains before it gets cold. The bike trails in Colorado are awesome.
838,i love the cold! more styleish clothing options
838,We travel with our cat sometimes. She doesn't like the cold weather. Her name is Leela.
838,aww she sounds adorable
838,She really is. She's a ragdoll cat and has the cutest gray face.
838,all gray?
838,No she has a white body. You should look us up. She has her own youtube channel.
838,totally!...whats the link?
838,Just look up colorado kitty on youtube. You will find her.
839,That sounds cool! How long have you had a lizard?
839,"No I have not owned one, I have several other pets to deal with."
839,What type of pets are they?
839,I have two small dogs and a cat that I love to bits!
839,I've always been a dog person but cats are also up there for me.
839,"I know they are like my babies, I enjoy spoiling them on a daily basis!"
839,Do you take them out to the park often?
839,I take them to the beach as we live close and they love to smell the salt air and play in the waves!
839,You should take me some time I would love to go to the beach.
839,"lol, I know its so healthy, do you enjoy the water?"
839,Yes but I cant swim
839,"Awww, Its good just to sit in the ocean and feel the sun on your face!"
840,How do you get yours worn down enough to finally fall asleep?! I'm starting to get used to sleeplessness.
840,Sometimes its just a battle of the wills.  I've gotten to the point where sometimes she just has to cry until she falls asleep.
840,I think my will power is the problem. I'm so undisciplined these days. I haven't even made it to the gym I just joined.
840,I know; having kids is sometimes so tiring it's hard to stay disciplined.  I work out at home now using youtube.
840,I guess as parents we do most everything at home. Work out at home. Shop from home. Eat at home.
840,"I agree!  I'm thankful to be able to stay home with them though, and not have to put them in daycare."
840,"As challenging as it can be sometimes, I am grateful too. My husband and I have always agreed that we don't want our kids in daycare."
840,"Yeah, they won't stay little for very long.  Though I do miss going out with our friends and having some adult time.  Haha!"
840,Ahh...being young and wild. Going out dancing! And eating good food without someone in your lap. Haha!
840,"Even if we got a babysitter that I trust, I don't think I'd have the energy to go dancing. I'm doing well to make some popcorn and watch a movie."
840,I doubt I'd be familiar with any of the latest hits. I'm stuck in the 80's even though I was born toward the end of them.
840,"Someday we will be out in the real world again.  For now, I'm happy to snuggle my sweet baby and sing her to sleep."
841,28
841,You should be very happy for him! That's great. Do you have a house?
841,"I unfortunately do not, it is such a financial commitment and my income is lacking."
841,"I'm right there with you. I am a teacher, so my pay isn't enough to put in to the house that I want. "
841,In my current position in just seems like a dream to one day own a house.
841,"Hopefully you will be able to save and find something great one day. I have been saving, and I hope to buy one in the next five years."
841,That is a realistic goal and sounds very achievable. Good luck!
841,Thank you! Good luck to you as well. What do you do for work?
841,Currently working in a smoothie shop to pay the bills.
841,That sounds fun! I recently started working at a school teaching 26 students.
841,Teaching is so vital to our society.
841,Absolutely! Especially with early learning in children. It is very rewarding.
842,"Hey, nice to meet you, where are you from?"
842,"I'm from Florida. How about you, where are you from?"
842,I am living in London and just eating some fruits after those errands 
842,I would love to visit London! This summer I vacationed in Italy. It was beautiful!
842,"You really should, there is a lot to see here! Amazing im sure it was relaxing. In which city have you been? "
842,I only had enough time to go to Rome and Naples. All that history in Rome - I could spend a year there and still want more!
843,"Yes, me too, I love playing with my kids"
843,It's almost as therapeutic as doing art to me.
843,I m very much interested in sewing
843,I have never done that personally before I am more of a graphic design person
843,"ohh ok, I learned through you tube video"
843,Youtube is a great place to find art tutorials.  I have learned many things myself from youtube.
843,"yep, agree, Need to watch limited video, otherwise we will get confused"
843,Yeah it's important to slow down if you aren't getting a good grasp on what they are trying to teach.
843,what are all your other hobbies ?
843,I really just spend the rest of my free time with those that are close to me.
843,"good, I m very much interested in playing table tennis"
843,"I haven't played it myself in a very long time, but I did when I was younger."
844,"It was on Monday. He seemed scared, so I felt a little bit guilty."
844,Oh no! I'm sure it was just due to meeting new people. What is your favorite activity to do with him?
844,"He loves to be read to. I think he's going to be a really smart kid, just like his dad. :)"
844,"Aww that's so sweet. Yea, he'll be very happy. What books do you read to him?"
844,He likes the Frog & Toad series! Did you read those when you were a kid? They're very funny.
844,"I did, and brought a copy to read to my son too, they're enjoyable! Do you have any other recommendations?"
844,"We like the classics. Winnie the Pooh, Alice in Wonderland, etc.. What about you? What do you usually read?"
844,"I enjoy reading Dr. Seuss books to my son, such good material."
844,"Oh, I didn't even think of those. Yes, those are definitely great. Dr. Seuss was in a class of his own."
844,"Yeah, thanks for the recommendations! Do you plan to take your kid back to daycare anytime soon?"
844,"Oh yes! He might not like it, but it's good for him to socialize. I think he will grow to love it."
844,"I'm sure he will, maybe he can share some of your favourite books with the rest of the class."
845,"Oh right, I see ... I love tennis but I could never seem to find the time to play"
845,"The matches are very long. But, you can still practice with friends and get the same feeling."
845,Maybe I need to learn to get my motivation levels up ... Or I could ask my friend to encourage me :) 
845,Practice can always help. You could find a pro that you like as well.
845,"Ah, the pros I like are getting older now, like me :) I loved Agassi, but I like watching Nadal now too. He's so entertaining"
845,Nadal is one of my favorites. Did you watch him in the US open this year?
845,Oh yes I did :) He never fails to draw me into a match
845,I wish I could find someone like him to date. I'm still single.
845,"Yep, the single life gets a little much sometimes ... "
845,I go on on dates regularly. Its exhausting.
845,"Exactly ... Sometimes it feels like more trouble than it's worth. It's better staying home, having a bath and read a book :)"
845,That sounds like my kind of night!
845,"Yep, with a little chocolate and wine added, excellent night :)"
846,are you a vegan?
846,"I am not, but I've heard well-planned vegan diets can reduce the risk of some types of chronic disease, like heart disease."
846,thats good to hear. I just decided to become vegan and am trying to adjust. 
846,It really limits your dietary choices.  I don't recommend it.   Have you considered vegetarian?
846,maybe I'll try it as a bit of a stepping stone. Usually I like to just jump in to things head first.
847,"Yes, I do love sports its a good way to get exercise!"
847,"good way to keep warm in Michigan, too. Ultimate Disc League is our favorite."
847,"I bet it can get very cold , I love hockey it is so exciting!"
847,It gets freezing! Especially if you live by the Ohio River.
847,I was born in New York so I know how cold it can get!
847,"on yes, New York i'm sure gets plenty of cold weather, do you have any kids? I bet they love playing in the snow."
847,"Yes, I have children but we have moved to Florida and enjoy the ocean now!"
847,Lucky! I would like to take the kids during the winter months for some fun in the sun!
847,You should we do a lot of water sports now and its so enjoyable!
847,What sort of water sports do you like to do that is family oriented?
847,"We do a lot of boating, fishing, skiing with ocean fun!"
847,awesome! i visit lake michigan every summer! we do the same things but i bet it is so much more fun in the ocean!!
848,I love playing video games and eating pizza.
848,video games range from computers to small hand held devices. which do you prefer?
848,Generally computers. How about you?
848,I own a ps4 and gaming PC but almost never touch the ps4. Been playing a ton of Modern warfare on pc though.
848,It that game any good? My brother and I have been debating on getting that or not.
848,The campaign is the best campaign in call of duty history. The multiplayer does have some issues that need to be worked out though.
848,Have you tried the survival mode? Im not into pvp as much since I'm horrible at shooters.
848,Yeah there is 5 coop missions that are pretty fun and very very challenging and horde is pretty fun but also pretty hard. 
848,"The last modern warfare game I touched was MW3, how much better is the new one."
848,Story wise its better in every way. The coop missions however are not as good in my opinion as MW3.
848,Does MW large scale compare to Battlefield? I love the open map warfare of Battlefield.
848,"Yeah, modern warfare has a new mode called ground war that takes place on huge maps with tanks and jets."
849,Do you want another cup of tea before you go?
849,I can't say no to hot tea. I might grab some cake too before I head out.
849,I love our visits.  Have you ever thought about belonging to a bookclub?
849,"I have, actually. But I don't know any to join. Are you a part of one?"
849,"No, but we could start our own!  There's so many good books I want to read."
849,"I wish I had more time to read, honestly. But maybe a book club is just what I need to get motivated."
849,Do you prefer fiction or nonfiction? Adventure or romance?  
849,"I cannot stand romance novels. Too cheesy. Non-fiction, on the other hand, is my favorite! What about you?"
849,"I like both, but I especially like nonfiction books about travel - I'd love to travel, but for now I just read about it!"
849,"If you want to see the world, you should come with me! I mostly travel on business, but it would be nice to have a companion."
849,What's your next destination?  How long do you usually stay?
849,I'm meeting with members of our partner company in Ontario next week. My trips usually last about a week.
850,I love Penn and Teller. I love decorating cakes too.
850,"That's awesome! You can watch them while you make some cakes, lol. How long have you been decorating cakes?"
850,"Ever since I realized I was a lesbian. So, around 12. What do you like to do?"
850,I like to research about science and space. I want to be an astronaut one day. That's my dream!
850,That's a wonderful aspiration! Are you in college?
850,"I am still in high school, so I am still figuring out where I should go. Hopefully I get some scholarships too."
850,"High school is the perfect time to look into / apply for scholarships. However, playing a sport would probably help more to pay for college."
850,That's great advice. Do you play any sports?
850,"No, I don't. Unless you consider hiking a sport. "
850,"Haha, well that's more exercise than I ever get. I am not very athletic."
850,Exercise is good for you! Try going for a small walk. What is your favorite food? Mine is cake obviously.
850,"I love cake too! Anything sweet. That's probably even more reason to start walking, lol."
850,Definitely! Try it. You'll feel great after a good walk.
851,"I love Mr. Bean,  Whenever I m watching his shows , I coulnt control laughing"
851,I love Mr. Bean as well. I watched his shows when I was younger.
851,now a days I like to watch stand up comedy show
851,I like to watch comedy shows on my television.
851,what is your other hobbies?
851,I play video games.
851,I have interested in art.  so i watch you tube video and learning to do
851,I watch spongebob on youtube.
851,"ok, what is your favorite restaurant?"
851,My favorite restaurant is Mcdonalds.
851,mine is Olive garden.
851,Olive garden is good. I go there sometimes.
852,He has been doing it for years.  I am failing my classes because I spend all my time watching him.
852,"Yeah, that seems like a skill that must practiced a lot."
852,I don't know how he does it.  We like to spend time in nature while I just watch him juggle.
852,That sounds relaxing.
852,Yes it's great.  We are going on a camping trip in the mountains next week.
852,That sounds like a lot of fun! Which mountains?
852,The Appalachian mountains
852,Yeah I heard that is beautiful country out there.
852,If you have never been yourself I highly recommend it.  I used to go every year as a child.
852,"I would live to go one day, I should plan it."
852,The weather is beautiful as well.
853,I have two daughters. Do you have any children?
853,Yes I have a son and just recently i became a grandpa
853,Congratulations! That's great. Do you have any hobbies?
853,Thank you! I try to not feel old haha. Yes I love playing soccers with my friends quite often. 
853,Keeping active will make you feel younger and healthy too. Will you teach your grandchild soccer?
853,"That is so right. It feels so much better than just becoming passive when getting older. Of course I will, keeping the heritage :)"
853,Wonderful. I am sure they will appreciate that! I like to photograph nature in my free time.
853,"Sorry I talked so much about myself! Thats amazing, nature is so calming. Do you just photograph nature?"
853,"That's okay! Yes, I mostly photograph nature, but I like to photograph other things as well, like people and landmarks."
853,Do you do it professionally or is it just a hobby? I just take pictures occasionally with my wife.
853,"People have paid me to photograph them before, but it is mostly a hobby. I work as a lawyer."
853,Oh nice! My brother in law is a lawyer and I remember him trying to get certain jobs he wanted and it not being easy sometimes
854,If I do say so myself. What do you do
854,I'm a graphic designer! I design company logos
854,That's interesting. How long have you been doing that?
854,"fir several years, i really love the work"
855,"Yeah, it's such an amazing movie, always makes me tear up."
855,I wonder if any of them enjoyed mystery flavour cake lol :)
855,I'm sure they would have. What type of movies make you emotional?
855,"Outdoor movies, where I can take my collection of toys wearing their rain coats in case of bad weather :)"
855,"Nice, I'm more of a fan of Mystery Thriller movies myself, though I don't have any toys to bring with me sadly."
855,Toys add to the mystery and I can hug them if it gets too scary - you should try :)
855,I'll give it a shot. What toys do you recommend getting?
855,"You can never go wrong with a teddy bear, the fluffier the better. That's why they need their rain coats :)"
855,Thanks for the advice! How many toys do you have yourself?
855,"I have way too many that have ended up in the attic - I don't like them being in the dark, so I visit them."
855,"That's cute, I'll make sure to take care of my teddy when I get them then, just for you!"
855,"It's always a good idea to take care of your teddy bears, sometimes they're better listeners than people :)"
856,"Ooo, exciting. Tell me more"
856,I could make some coffee and you could inform me of the stories.
856,That sounds like an excellent plan.
856,So I am ready whenever you are
856,Sounds good. Maybe we can meet up later.
856,"Sounds like a plan, just call me. "
856,Will do! What else are you up to today?
856,Just going to work for a few hours.
856,Where do you work?
856,I work in an office in Atlanta.
856,Very cool! Is it nice there?
856,"Absolutely, I love it. "
857,Is it possible to be buff being a vegetarian?
857,"I wouldn't know, I'm hardly ""buff"" but feel healthy!"
857,I run and swim alot so I was just wondering if just eating plants alone will help me.
857,"Well, you still need protein for sure but you can get that through beans, tofu, etc.  "
857,Wow I honestly did not know tofu had any protein. What's your favorite dish?
857,I love all veggies so I often do a stir fry and spice it up with some chiles.  
857,That sounds very good! I need to try that out one day. How can I make it?
857,I don't use a recipe; just heat some OVO and quickly cook the veggies.  I like them still crunchy.  Add spices as desired.
857,What is OVO?
857,"Olive oil.  If you like nuts, they are a good source of protein too.  Just add some cashews or walnuts!"
857,I sound so dumb now. Do you recommend any veggies I should get?
857,"Oh, never say dumb!  You're learning!  I like cabbage, zucchini, onions, celery, carrots, and red or green peppers.  "
857,Thank you so much for everything! I'll keep this in mind the next time I cook.
858,"I agree, it's a great movie. Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor and handsome too, lol."
858,He is a very great actor. I also like him in Gangs of New York.
858,"Oh, I've never seen that, but I have heard of it! I'll have to watch it. I don't watch a lot of movies, but I want to watch more."
858,You should watch it. It's a great movie. What do you like to do?
858,"Well, I work a lot, but when I get home I like to spend time with my dog and take walks."
858,That sounds like a good way to have fun and get some exercise! I also have two dogs. What kind of dog do you have?
858,She's a poodle! They're a very smart breed. What about you?
858,"I love poodles! My aunt has two. I also like bigger dogs, just do not have room. I have a beagle."
858,"Awwwe, how cute. Yeah, I always wanted a big dog too, but I don't want to coop them up in a small apartment."
858,I am in the same situation. But my beagle loves to go on runs and go to the dog park.
858,"Have you ever had any problems at the dog park, like a fight with another dog?"
858,Fortunately I have not. My dog is very friendly with people and other dogs. Most of the other dogs there are very friendly too.
859,"No, I didn't and I realize it was wrong."
859,People make mistakes. Have you made up with her?
859,I am currently in the process of trying to work things out.
859,"I wish you the best of luck, and hope you learned from it. Do you all have kids together?"
859,I do realize it was a huge mistake.  We don't have any kids.
859,Do you want any in the future?
859,We're unsure at the moment. I think that maybe one day we might.
859,It can be a huge decision. Kids are very expensive. Did you grow up with any siblings?
859,"I had a brother, but he passes away in a car accident several years ago."
859,That's horrible. I am sorry for your loss. I can't imagine going through something like that.
859,Thank you. I appreciate that.  It has been a struggle to move forward.
859,I can only imagine. I'm forunate i've never had to experience that.
860,"Not as good as my boyfriend's gig, but it should do the trick! I'm hoping I won't have to get a second one. "
860,I have four kids and I always tell them to be careful with debt. It can help you if used wisely; it can also be a pain!
860,I wish my parents had been smart enough with money to give me that kind of advice. They spend more time arguing than helping me out.
860,"That's truly a shame. My husband and I just split up, but I always made sure we didn't argue in front of the kids."
860,I'm sorry to hear that. Sometimes I wish my moms would split. But I think my younger brother would take it pretty hard.
860,"Yeah, it's hard on the young ones. Mine are all old enough to understand. You said ""moms"" - do you have 2 moms?"
860,"Yep, I got two. My brother is pretty much outnumbered. Our two dogs are even females. "
860,"That's pretty neat to have 2 moms. Except your brother being outnumbered by estrogen, ha ha."
860,It definitely has its perks. So what is it like after divorce? Any better than an unhappy marriage?
860,"Yes, better to be alone than having to fight with someone all the time."
860,"I hope I didn't overstep by asking that question. I'm just curious. If my parents keep it up, I'm afraid that might be our future."
860,"It's always hard when families break up. However, if everybody tries to respect the others, it can end up being even better for all."
861,alcohol is the word I misspelled  
861,"That's a shame, but 2nd place is nothing to be ashamed of either way. You should be proud!"
861,Yes I won the entire contest the year prior so it is ok.
861,Did any prizes come with the victory? Gift cards and the such?
861,I was given an article in the new yorker magazine as well as savings bonds.
861,That's quite impressive! I'll take it that it was a national competition and not a local one?
861,Yes it was the national spelling bee.
861,That's nice. I was never too good at spelling
861,It's just a matter of practicing 
861,"Ha, it must be true if the champion says so ;) Do you still participate in these events? Even if only as a host"
861,I will be too old to enter the event next year.  I do not plan to attend
861,"Aw, that's a shame. You should tell me more about that this weekend. Are you free sunday"
862,Well not much has happened to me in the past year.
862,"Have you made the effort to travel at all?  You know, get out and see something new?"
862,I would but my landlord increased the rent so I don't have any money to save up.
862,That's too bad!  But it doesn't have to cost alot.  I love just to drive old country roads and tent camp.
862,You're right. I'll try to find someone to help me with transportation costs on road trips.
862,That's excellent thinking!  There's nothing like hiking to clear your head and feel freedom.
862,Have you been on any road trips or hiking ?
862,"Oh yes, I take road trips often.  If it's bad weather, I sleep in the back of my car but I prefer to pitch a tent."
862,Do you travel with anyone else?
862,"Once in while with my spouse, but mostly by myself.  I like to hike in the wilderness and enjoy God's great creation."
862,That sounds so calming and relaxing. Do you have any recommendations??
862,"National parks are great, but just get out on the back roads.  Find a quiet place to make camp and explore!"
863,"I heard about him. Is there a book you can recommend by him, something that catches me from the start?"
863,"Yes, check out ""Psycho Steve""."
863,"Thank you mate! So, do you have any others interests beside reading?"
863,I like to drink cappuccinos at Starbucks.
863,"you seem like you enjoy time by yourself. I actually made my only hobby to my profession, I play for the baltimore orioles"
863,Baltimore Orioles is my favorite team in the mlb.
863,You are da man! We had such a good season this year
864,"it feels like it takes forever, lol. But it really helps me to stay flexible :)"
864,"I can only imagine, It takes a lot of determination. "
864,A lot of determination and plenty of bottles of water :) Always makes me thirsty. 
864,Water is great for the soul.
864,"Yep, as we're mostly made up of water, it seems to make sense to stay hydrated. And it reminds me to water my horses."
864,"Wow, I did not know you have horses. Are they fun?"
864,Great fun! And another brilliant form of exercise that doesn't really feel like exercise if you know what I mean?
864,"Of course, I can only imagine. Sounds like pure fun."
864,"Yep, and then after that I have a yoga session to wind down."
864,I've heard yoga is super relaxing. 
864,"Yep, I'm an instructor, but it never feels like work. It's super addictive :)"
864,I think I'm going to give it a try. 
864,"Yep, I would highly recommend it :)"
865,oh really? i wonder why the directors changed so much...
865,Its quite common for TV shows to have different directors for each episode.
865,so its not because their performance was poor?
865,No its usually because of scheduling.
865,I am a mechanic. What do you do?
865,an actor. mostly in theatre. what type of mechanic work do you do?
865,on classic cars!
865,"cool, do you own any old cars your self? "
865,yes i have a 1964 mustang
865,Nice. what color is it? 
865,its red! with white striping
866,How do you feel about it?
866,It has gotten better with some therapy. At times I am still a little down.
866,Do you do anything to help with that?
866,"I've tried some natural remedies, and I have a very large cd collection that I listen to, to try to take my mind off things."
866,I like music also. Who do you listen to when you are depressed?
866,I like to listen to something with an upbeat message to it. I tend to listen to classic rock. What kind of music do you like?
866,The same. Pink Floyd. Led Zeppelin. Like that.
866,I'm a huge fan of Led Zeppelin myself. Do you have any favorite songs?
866,The Song Remains the Same and No Quarter off their live New York show.
866,Fantastic choices. No Quarter is one of my favorite. I may have to go with Kashmir as being my absolute favorite though. Wish I could have seen them live.
866,Me Too. I just missed Page and Plant once. really bummed me out.
866,"It would bum me out too. Plant has some of the best vocals ever, and Jimmy was quite the wizard on guitar."
867,That seems like a noble cause.
867,"For sure! I used to work for one, so I'm a little passionate about it."
867,I imagine that can be a very rewarding job.  I love animals.
867,Do you have any furry friends? I've got a husky mix named Cherry. 
867,Awesome.  I have a basset hound named Banjo.
867,That's the most adorable name ever. I love when people choose unique dog names. Too many Daisy's and Cooper's.
867,Thank you. I agree.  I always try to come up with something different.
867,I just ran into this girl I knew back in high school. She named her dog Peeve. You can imagine why...
867,That is hilarious!  Very creative!
867,"Creative, yes. But poor doggie. :)"
867,LOL.  I am sure she loves him very much. ;)
867,"Yeah, you could tell she loved him to death. Are you a cat person?"
867,"I think cats are alright, but I am more of a dog person."
868,I will be 32.
868,Happy early birthday.  Will you be celebrating?
868,"Thank you! I will be having dinner with my husband, but I mostly want to relax and take the day off work."
868,That sounds like a great time.  I used to not be able to do much for my birthdays because I was a truck driver.
868,That's unfortunate. My dad used to be a truck driver and would often work holidays. What do you do now?
868,I am now a stay at home wife.  I quit after I got married. 
868,Do you have children?
868,No I don't my husband and I is pretty enough for us.
868,"I am in the same boat. I used to be a nurse, so I was away from home a lot. I work from home now though."
868,That sounds like a nice setup
868,It is great. I enjoy spending time with my husband.
868,That's great you are able to do that.  I also love my husband.
869,"Oh, I guess I think of pizza as being "
869,"Yea its great when topped with meat and vegetables,  you should try it"
869,I have - I think of Pizza as American!  Haha!  I don't get out too much but pizza is easy to have delivered.
869,Yea especially since pizza delivery is so convenient and available in some parts of the world like the US. but Italian style pizza is unique
869,What makes it unique?  I just never go to fancy restaurants.
869,The way they bake it is not like the commercial style in the U.S. its less oily
869,What are your favorite toppings?  Is it thick or thin crust?
869,"thin crust , my favorite toppings is always meat. what are your preferences ?"
869,"I like all veggies especially green or greek olives, and feta cheese."
869,"that's nice , i tend to like the big individual slices with sausage and mushrooms . Have you had any of lately ?"
869,"No, I tend to stay home and eat very simply - lots of salads or fresh fruit and cheese.  Do you live in a big city?"
869,"I do not, but I live right outside of it, so I get the culture. so you are a health conscious person ?"
870,I guess I can't complain too much. I knew it was part of the job description. 
870,I guess that does go with the territory.
871,Unfortunately I was unable to get everything that I needed. 
871,"I m very unfamiliar with snow storms because i Live in California, I would guess it is much like preparing for wildfire"
871,"I'm in the Midwest. Weather here is so unpredictable. A lot of times the news will call for snow or ice and we don't get any, or vice versa. "
871,"do you live in midwest, Not much dynamic in weather here"
871,"Yes I live in Missouri. You can experience all four seasons in one day. California weather seems so much nicer, but without the wildfires. "
871,"we are very much bothering about traffic, taking too much time to travel one place to another place"
871,There's a lot of traffic here too depending on if you're in a big city or not. 
871,"mmm,   Planning to move Florida or North Carolina"
871,That sounds nice. I love the beach. 
871,"ya, Me too.  How about texas weather? do you know anything about it?"
871,I know that it's hot and they get a lot of tornadoes. We get them in Missouri too. Have you ever been in a tornado?
871,"Personally have not, But I heard about that"
872,"OMG yes, those brick phones are so funny. My grandma still uses a flip phone.. they're still out there."
872,"My grandma uses one, too! I have to explain to my parents how to perform tasks on their smartphones all the time"
872,"Yeah, I know.. I think it's easier for them to use Apple products. They are simpler to figure out and less prone to error."
872,"I have always had Android phones and have never had an issue with the OS. The iOS seems more confusing to me, really."
872,"Really? I guess it depends on the person then. Maybe in the future phones will just read our minds and do what we need, lol."
872,That would be fantastic lol. It really does seem like technology is moving quickly enough that it could be a possibility in the future.
872,"Yeah! I can't wait to be able to use a self-driving car. It's a little scary, but they say it's safer than a human driver."
872,"I think it would help eliminate road rage at the very least. Also, you could play on the phone while ""driving"" and not have to really worry about it!"
872,"That's true, robots don't feel rag. Or at least not yet... Haha. "
872,"Yep, another example of technology moving super-rapidly. AI could develop road rage over time and kill us all lol"
872,That's a hilarious thought. I'm sure someone will make a movie about it eventually.
872,"""Planet of the Cars"" sounds plausible, like an awful B-Rated movie. :P"
873," Oh, I love to collect rocks and sea-glass. I have a rock tumbler my kids got me as a present"
873,I always wanted to get a rock tumbler. Sadly I never think to get one
873,"I never got around to it, and then my kids surprised me :) The pebbles inspire me to write poetry too."
873,I like poetry. Have you had anything published?
873,A couple of small collections :) I started as a proofreader for greetings cards believe it or not :)
873,Everyone has to start somewhere
873,"Yep, and as I love reading and words in general, it seemed like a good opportunity for my first steps."
873,When oppotunity knocks you have to answer
873,"Definitely, otherwise you never find out what's on the other side of that door :)"
873,The only way to succeed is to try
873,"Yep, and then try and try again if you don't get there the first time :)"
873,that is so true
873,"You just have to try and have faith in yourself, even when it's hard to do :)"
874,"yea, i just recently got my third tattoo, and probably more in the future. "
874,I want some soon.
874,"Nice, do you already have a motive in mind? "
874,"Yes, I want to get Barack Obama's face on my arm. "
874,"Haha never thought of getting a face as a tattoo, do you admire him? "
874,"Absolutely, I love him."
874,"Same here, and then came Trump. Obama had some house parties with my favorite musicians, he sure has taste"
874,"Yeah, I could never agree with Trump. He's a tool."
874,"So true.. I actually work as a guard in the white house, so keep it for youself. They don't want us to have any opinions or leak information"
874,"Oh wow, I will pray for you. "
874,I Appreciate it haha 
874,No problem whatsoever. 
874,Alright see you around 
875,"We actually planned for this child, and i'm very excited. Did you plan on having multiple kids, or none at all?"
875,I want kids. Just not yet.
875,It's very expensive trying to raise a kid. Do you have any hobbies?
875,I like the outdoors. Backpacking is a big deal to me.
875,I love the outdoors as well. Have you had the chance to go backpacking anywhere you really wanted to?
875,I've been to Colorado many times. The Uncompaghre area is really nice.
875,"I've always wanted to go to Colorado, i haven't had the chance yet unforunately. Where is your dream destination?"
875,"I would love to go to Tibet, but I would be hard pressed to trust China. Maybe Nepal."
875,"Yeah things are looking pretty rough over there as of late. Tibet would be beautiful though, so would Nepal. I would love the chance to go to Switzerland."
875,Yes the Alps would be great. I've been to France but not the mountains there.
875,"I've never been, but would love to visit there as well. I have been to Italy though, and that was amazing."
875,I had a friend in High School with relatives in the Dolomites and he took me with him once.
876,I hope that nothing is wrong with it.  Hopefully somone will take him in.
876,I sure hope so. I'd take him in myself but I can't have dogs in my apartment
876,That is unfortunate I'm going on a cruise next month and need to find someone to watch my dog.
876,My parents used to just board there dog when they went on vaca it was expensive though. What kind of dog is it?
876,My dog would have a heart attack if I did that.  It is an english bulldog.
876,I've always wanted an English bulldog. They are absolutely adorable
876,"Yes my parents have one also, they just moved to florida"
876,Oh yeah? I hope they have fun. My stepdad was on duty down there for a while had a blast
876,"Yeah it's pretty nice, but a little too hot for me."
876,I feel that. The summers there must be brutal
876,Yeah I don't think I could handle that kind of weather.
876,Facts. I gotta admit its better than snow in the middle of February lol
877,"I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm bragging, it's just that I've been given a second chance at life and really want to enjoy it!"
877,"ok, how so ?"
877,I'm in remission from cancer; I don't make a ton of money but if there's something I want to enjoy I go for it!
877,Im sorry to hear that. I heard there is 100 different types of cancer. its good to know that your a survivour 
877,"It's something you learn to live with, the possibility of it returning.  But it's made me more thankful and appreciative of all I've been given!"
877,"oh that's wonderful ! i'm so glad for people like you, what do you do to help you cope with it ?"
877,Just keep my regular doctor visits and thank God - prayer and thankfulness have become a huge part of my life.
877,"oh thats wonderful, i know your dog may add to your happyness"
877,He's a terrific companion!  Do you have any pets?
877,"i am a huge dog lover ! yes i have one, a golden retriever "
877,What's his name?
877,"Goldie, she helps me get through my tough days"
878,"Yes, I watch the figure skating and rhythmic gymnastics sections"
878,Those can be entertaining.  Do you play any sports?
878,I play soccer and I dance.
878,What kind of dance do you do?
878,"Ballet, Contemporary, Hip Hop, Jazz, and Musical Theatre. I hate tap, though. That's the only one I don't do"
878,"That sounds like fun.  My sister loves ballet.  Swan Lake is a favorite of hers, obviously."
878,It's a really good ballet.
878,"I saw the movie Black Swan, it seemed like an interesting story."
878,"Black Swan isn't really the story of Swan Lake though, it focuses on one character who's dancing in the show"
878,"Oh, well, ballet is more my sister's thing. ;)"
878,"Haha yeah, it's a lot tougher than most people understand, too."
878,I imagine that's true.  What position do you play in soccer?
879,"I have lots of people around me, but how can I avoid choosing the bad ones?"
879,"I would listen to my friend's opinions, even though it's hard to hear. A lot of times they end up being right."
879,Should I listen to my parents? They've had an unsuccessful marriage
879,"Maybe not parents, especially if they're divorced or unhappy. They could be jaded and biased."
879,Maybe I could look to some of my friends' parents with successful marriages
879,I think that's a good idea. People are just different these days too and less committed to marriage.
879,Who do you look for when you need life advice?
879,"It might sound silly, but I go to Reddit for life advice, lol. :) There's a lot of wise people on there!"
879,"Yes!! I often find myself on reddit too! It's my favorite ""social media"" platform by far!"
879,"Me too! It reminds me of the ""old days"" of the internet, where you could talk and be anonymous."
879,"Ah, yes. The anonymity is great. Strangely, in a lot of cases I feel like people are held more accountable for their comments because of the upvotes/downvotes"
879,"That's true, and the anonymity can actually make people more genuine and vulnerable with each other."
879,Nice chatting with you!
880,Did you have long working days as a chef?
880,"Sometimes, depends on the demand. "
880,"Being a truck driver was OK, it gave me a bad back though"
880,Ouch. Did you require surgery?
880,"It's an ongoing issue, currently trying to manage it with pain medication"
880,I hope it gets better for you. 
880,"Tell me about your job, you must have your own injuries working in the kitchen all day"
880,Just a few burned fingers haha
880,Still got all ten then? None got chopped and fell into the soup?
880,"lol Oh God, no. Luckily I still have all ten. "
880,What did you enjoy cooking the most as a chef? Did you specialise in a certain cuisine?
880,My lasagna is to kill for. 
881,do you like to cook?
881,I love cooking. Thinking about becoming a chef. I love the way food brings people together.
881,what is you favourite dish to make?
881,"my favourite dish to make is a special called, 'welsh rarebit'. Its simple but with my spin on it, its a dish not to be frowned upon"
881,"yum sounds tasty. Im more into baking, my self."
881,"Oh right, i bake too sometimes, I create an english breakfast pie,inot very healthy but we all have vices. do you have a favourite? "
881,I like a good cheese cake.
881,"mm very tasty, what brand cheese do you use? i tried Stilton but it wasn't very popular with my 10 adopted children."
881,I like to use Philadelphia cream cheese.
882,I asked some of my friends to spend the night while my family is gone. That will help.
882,"That is a good idea, as long as you do what you prefer."
882,"I agree. I am also very busy with school work and college, so I should be distracted."
882,I can certainly understand that.
882,Are you in college?
882,"No, I graduated a few years ago. "
882,Congratulations! What did you study?
882,I graduated with a major in business and minor in economics 
882,That's great. I just started recently. I am studying chemistry. 
882,I really liked chemistry because it allowed me to really try and understand life at a small level.
882,"That is also why I like chemistry. I am very busy with three science classes, but I am excited to learn more."
882,I just think it's cool how chemical elements make up the matter of the universe.
883,It's not a tiny city but its pretty small compared.
883,I live in a small town also. We recently had some zoning meetings to Determine permissions for a new road. hope they allow running
883,Well i am an author so the smaller town has been better for my writing since it is much quieter.
883,That's great. What do you write about? fiction or non-fiction ?
883,"Fiction, mostly scifi things, I really love space and aliens and things like that."
883,i like science fiction also . i hope you do well with your writing. whats your latest piece ?
883,I am working on a set of space opera novels.
883,"Sounds interesting. I'd love to check that out!, where can i see copies of your work ?"
884,"now that I'm off work, I'm going to catch up on world news. Do you keep up with news/politics?"
884,"I do, but sometimes I feel like it doesn't matter because I can't change anything."
884,Good point. I feel the same way but I do like to know how things are changing me
884,"That's completely true. It's good to take a break from new though, because it can be depressing."
884,Absolutely. What do you like to do when you're feeling down? I like to run.
884,I like to play basketball with my friends. Any exercise is great for the mind.
884,Sounds like fun! I've never been a basketball player myself but I can appreciate the game
884,"Yeah, it can be hard to find people to play sports with once you hit adulthood, lol."
884,All too true! I suppose that's why I've taken to running
884,"I want to start running too. Have you ever felt ""runner's high""?"
884,I have on rare occasion. I strive for ~2 miles whenever I run so I'm no long distance runner by any means
884,"Oh okay, I see. How long do you have to run to get the runner's high usually?"
884,Depends on the person! I've known others who run 7-8 at a time and have never felt it.
885,"Interesting.. I never knew that, maybe I'm too much of a city person, I'm from Chicago haha"
885,"I'm from Philadelphia.  I suppose most people now live in or nears cities.  A hundred years ago,most people lived on farms."
885,"Thank god those days are over, it's so much more convenient now I'm sure!"
885,"I agree.  I love to spend time outdoors backpacking and camping, but it is always nice to return to all the modern conveniences."
886,I am currently single and have been for awhile
886,That's okay. It's good to take time to be single and understand who you are and what you want in a prtner
886,That is so true. I'll find someone one day. I'm in no rush
886,That's a really good philosophy. I feel like a lot of people have this idea that they HAVE to find someone as soon as possib;e
886,Then they wonder why their relationships are toxic. Some people are crazy
886,"Yeah, my mom was a social worker and she saw a lot of teens who got into toxic relationships because they rushed it"
886,You can't love someone else until you love yourself
886,That's true
886,More people need to realize that and quit looking for fairytale ending
886,"I agree. Plus the idea that there's the ""perfect person"" out there is just false. No one's perfect, but if you love them, you'll work through issues together"
886,Some people can't seem to tell that they are the common denominator
886,"completely agree . if you can't be happy alone , you'll not be with someone else ."
887,Do you have any kids?
887,I have 3. What about you? they are the ones that introduced me to bikini bottom
887,"I don't have any kids, but I also love spongebob. "
887,"It is the best show ever made ever in life ever lol, cant get enough of patrick. who is your favorite charachter ?"
887,"Patrick, for sure. He's hilarious."
887,"spongebob is so funny , he is kind of wield sometime . what kind of music do you listen to ?"
887,"Typically rap and R&B, I listen to it almost every day. How about you?"
887,"i like alot more melodious music , more singing.i hardly do rap & r&b"
887,You should try listening to H.E.R.
887,I'm gonna look that up. i've never listened to H.E.R. although i've heard of the artist
887,"Yeah, she's brilliant. I highly recommend her. "
887,i'll take your encouragement. so what do you do ?
888,"Not so much, people often stare at me there because I am a 6 feet talland here in Thailand girls are usually very small"
888,"Oh, wow.  I always wished I was taller than I am.  I'm sorry it makes you uncomfortable."
888,Thank you! It's hard to find a partner when most boys are like 5''7 but with my friends i take it with humour :) How tall are you?
888,"I'm 5'8"", which isn't short for a woman, but I always wanted to be just a little bit taller."
888,I think thats perfect! A lot of models have such height. Where are you living? 
888,"I live off the west coast of Florida, so I go to the beach a lot with my children."
888,"Wow, I want to go to the US someday. My parents could move there once instead moving 40 times to different cities in thailand haha "
888,"America is a great place.  Lots of different things to see.  I imagine Thailand is beautiful, though."
888,"I imagine! What places do you like the most around florida? Thailand has really nice places, especially for tourist, but many parts are veery polluted"
888,"I love the beaches on the west coast.  The east coast isn't as pretty, and the water isn't as calm.  There's also Disney World and Universal Studios. "
888,"I always think of hip hop and gangs when hearing west coast and east coast, no idea why :D Anyways what are working as? "
888,"Haha, those phrases are used a lot in rap songs.  I'm a stay-at-home mom at the moment. What about you?"
889,Yes I kept walking faster and faster trying to ignore the person
889,Did he have a weapon?
889,I couldn't tell if he had a weapon. I'm always assuming everyone has weapon its kind of a sad society these days
889,I think it is very important that our young people do not see this type of stuff.
889,Yes I somewhat agree with you but at the same time you keep a young person sheltered if you know what I mean
889,Definitely.  Did you make any adjustments to prevent or protect yourselves after this horrific event?
890,"New Orleans, absolutely love the Jazz scene"
890,It is very nice. It's a nice place for jazz admirers.
890,Do you have any pets at home?
890,"Nope, I plan on getting one after finishing my studies."
890,"Oh, Interesting! What are you studying? I currently have 3 dogs and a parrot that LOVES to sing"
890,Currently studying law. I would love to hear you parrot sing!
890,"Oh wow, you're very intelligent to be studying law! I hope it goes well for you!"
890,Thank you! It's too bad I don't have a lot of time to go out or anything.
890,Constantly studying?
890,"Yup, studying is very demanding to say the least!"
890,"I haven't studied in a couple of years now, I managed to gain a few qualifications in IT with the big tech wave"
890,"Interesting! What made you want to get into IT, besides the tech wave?"
890,"I used to be a girl but I loved IT, so I made a big decision and changed my gender as I was always getting harrassed"
891,she was really responsive and we got along well
891,i hope she was happy and said yes ?
891,"yep, it was crazy"
891,Are you going to see her again?
891,"yes, we are hanging out later"
891,where will you guys be going ?
891,we're going to get dinner and then hang out a little bit
891,that sounds good
891,really good
891,"great , we will probably dine out afterwards"
891,"yeah, i'm looking forward to some good food"
891,oh ok
892,"That is great, I am sure you will do wonderful at the track meet"
892,"Thank you. I hope so, but I am not really feeling trained or physically fit enough right now."
892,I know the feeling. But a little bit every day goes a long way!
892,Definitely . Maybe if I ate better i'd have more motivation. That is something I am working on.
892,"I've heard there are websites and apps that help with that, should make it a little easier to get through."
892,Any apps you recommend?
892,My Fitness Pal has been a favorite of mines for years. Easy to use and very helpful
892,Thanks.  i will have to look into it .  I am always open to trying new things.
892,"Sounds good, I am sure it will be a huge help and you'll be placing first in line!"
892,Thanks for the extra motivation!
892,Anytime!
892,I am glad we got to catch up. It was good to talk to you.
893,I don't know part of me really wants to go but I just don't think I could handle it
893,"It took me a while to get use to it, but I ended up loving it. Do you prefer colder weather, with less sun?"
893,I guess I want something more in the middle. My fiance is from new york but I can't deal with the snow lol
893,I don't think I could deal with the extremely fast paced environment. lol The middle sounds about right to me too. Do you visit NY often?
893,I've been once. When we were in school she would go up every summer. We're homing to take a trip sometime next year
893,I hope you get the chance. I would love to visit the west coast one day. I was born and raised on the east.
893,Same honestly. I have some family out in Cali too but I haven't seen them in years
893,It looks so beautiful. Seems like a happy place to be. I'd love to visit Washington as well.
893,I've actually never been to Washington but I hear a lot of places are nice and quiet
893,"I don't think I could ever live there because of the rain, but I would love to see the Pacific from the coast. Are you a beach or mountains person?"
893,I love the beach but actually living at the beach is very busy. Mountains would be a nice change of pace
893,"'ve been in mountains my whole life, and feel like I would love the beach. "
894,Interesting...what instrument is this again?
894,The violin.  It is a beautiful sounding instrument.
894,Nice! I like to play the flute. Do you play the violin professionally?
894,"I enjoy listening to the flute.  No, I just play for myself and friends.  How long have you been playing the flute?"
894,I've played for approximately 8 years. How about you with your instrument?
894,"I have been playing for close to 40 years, but I did not play much in my twenties and thirties."
894,Wow! That's amazing that you've kept with it. I hope to do the same although recently I've been spending my time studying software development
894,"It is great to be able to play a musical instrument, but we also need to earn a living doing something like you, studying software development."
894,I'm fortunate that I'm able to make a good living doing what I enjoy! I know not everyone can say the same.
894,"Good for you!  When someone enjoys their work, they are much more likely to excel at it.  I bet you are good at it."
894,I think I am! Although I like to stay humble. I'm sure you've perfected your craft at the violin!
894,"I wish I did.  If I had perfected it, I would be playing violin professionally.  I was never dedicated enough to excel at it."
895,"Yes, barely. A lot of damage was done to the exterior."
895,"Wow, that sounds terrible! I think for me, the most storm activity in our area was 2010. There were winter storms, hailstorms, flooding, all sorts of terrible weather events."
895,"Oh wow, did your home make it okay?"
895,we did. how was your experience ?
895,"It wasn't great. luckily, insurance paid for most of the damages. "
895,That's good! I know insurance can be a pain to deal with! how was your experience with them?
895,"It was pretty good, I would recommend them if anyone is looking for insurance. "
895,that's good to know. how are you doing since that experience ?
895,"I'm doing great, thanks for asking. "
895,You're welcome.  I wish you the best! what do you do for a living ?
895,Vendor management. how about you?
895,vendor management ? whats that ?
896,no no.. i am free out of worktime.
896,do you enjoy recycling?  its groovy I think
896,yaes.
896,what kind of vehicle do you drive?
896,no.
896,i recycle
896,oh ok good.
896,what kind of stuff do you recycle
896,No. do not recycle
896,i recycle plastic
896,oh that is pollution affect 
896,yep
897,I live in Toronto 
897,I been to Toronto! It's a cool place.
897,It is very nice! Although it does get cold for most of the year.
897,It must be different if you live where it is cold most of the time in the year.
897,Yes it is. I do use my vacation time to go to hotter places.
897,Where do you go for your vacations?
897,My favourite place is Jamaica!
897,Jamaica is a wonderful place. The people of Jamaica are free spirited like me.
897,Yes it really is. The people are very friendly. They are all about having a good time.
897,I would love to go to Jamaica in the future.
897,It should definitely be on your radar to go!
897,I can't wait to go there sometime.
898,I have been dreaming about retiring since I started my first job at 16
898,I totally feel the same. I am over working. I need a break.
898,"I know what you mean. I just hope all this hard work really does pay off at the end. If not, there is always whiskey"
898,"I am more of a wine kind of girl. I like to relax at home, listen to some Rolling stones, and have a glass of wine. "
898,"Sounds like a pretty good night. For me, nothing like cuddling up with my puppy and watch a movie. The small things are the best things"
898,I agree. That also sounds like a peaceful way to spend an evening.
898,"Yep, after a long day of working there is no better way to unwind"
898,Nice. What kind of dog do you have?
898,I have a little maltese. His name is Samwise Gamgee but I just call him Sam for short. He is my everything!
898,LOL! I love it! What a cute name. I might use that in the future.
898,By all means go for it!  I hope to eventually get him a little brother or sister and have a little fellowship
898,I am sure he would appreciate that. Then you can all cuddle and watch a movie together.
899,Yeah but was it trumps doing or was it a side effect from the Obama administration?
899,Who really knows?  I think it's best just to be thankful that things seem to be going in a positive direction.
899,"Yeah I tend to agree with that, now if we could just get the environment going in a better direction."
899,I agree.  It would be nice if people would be a bit more considerate of our planet. 
899,"I'm not sure who i dislike more, anti vaxxers or climate deniers. Both parties are going to be our downfall."
899,Both are aggravating.  The two party system of our government will be the downfall.  It's dividing America.
899,yeah the two party system is horrible but I don't think that's going to change anytime soon.
899,"No, I don't think so either.  It's unfortunate, I think most people don't see that as the problem.  It gets me pretty depressed sometimes."
899,I think Party over policy is a huge problem. Just look at all the stuff going on with the Trump administration at the moment.
899,"No one wants to look at a ""problem"" and choose a sensible solution. People want to pick according to what ""their side"" has chosen to be the answer."
899,I also think the electoral college is a pretty big issue that needs to be addressed. 
899,"Probably.  I don't know a whole lot about it, but that's an issue my husband has mentioned to me before.  He's more knowledgeable."
900,To the Bahamas
900,That is a good place to have as a destination to accomplish getting over your fear of flying!
900,What places have you been on an airplane?
900,"I have been to Mexico, England and other states in the USA. I enjoy flying, but I didn't always. Have you flown again?"
900,I have not.  The opportunity has not presented itself as of yet
900,Would you be willing to go again?
900,"Possibly, if the time and destination were right."
900,It is awesome that you have conquered your fear! I try to practice the techniques I've learned from yoga to help me with my fears.
900,I ten to run to help myself relax and deal with stress.
900,"That's how my son likes to deal with his stress, poor kid is in high school and thinks life is hard! Shew"
900,I feel sometimes the pressures for children are too great.  
900,I agree. Kids can't be kids anymore! It is a shame
901,felling the wind on my face when i run
901,I can see how that could be soothing if you didn't get motion sickness
901,do you run /
901,"I love running, but it needs to be in the right area. You?"
901,"it's my enjoyment , my stress reliever. "
901,That is a great stress reliever. How far do you normally run?
901,"bout 4 miles easy, i like to run when its cool and windy"
901,"Wow. I only make it about a mile, mile and a half.  When I have time."
901,"its all in the mind , once you can believe it you can do it"
901,Do you like any other sports?
901,"not really, "
901,"oh , do you listen to music while you run ?"
901,"i do , helps encourage me"
901,What are some of your favorites?
901,"r&b preferably, what about you ?"
901,Sublime mostly.
901,ok sound nice
902,That's a long time to be on top. Do you like any other sports?
902,"Pretty much every single sport, but especially basketball."
902,Do you have a favorite team? Do you prefer college or professional?
902,"it is tough to have a favorite player , but i've a team ! do you ?"
902,"Yes, I am a fan of the Washington Wizards. I like all Washington teams."
902,i prefer the mavericks myself .
902,I have nothing against them. Did/do you play any sports?
902,"Yes, I played basketball and soccer, and I am also a varsity swimmer"
902,You sound like quite the athlete. I honestly just recently learned how to swim.
902,"it is a great skill to have , do you play sports ?"
902,"No, I use to play football though."
902,Did you play college football? I hear its one step from professional
903,High school teachers are very valuable
903,"Indeed they are. They are the last ones to prepare students for college and the ""real world."""
903,My history teacher was also my basketball coach. 
903,Was he better at teaching or coaching?
903,Coaching.  He inspired me to play in college.
903,How did that go? Where did you go?
903,UTEP
903,"I've never heard of that, where is that?"
903,University of Texas El Paso
903,Oh nice! Did you like the school?
903,I did!
903,I've never been to Texas. How was the culture there?
904,It absolutely is. I feel like sharing information is one of the things that make us human
904,"Yes I agree. I particularly enjoy how stories are a means to communicate information through groups, families and even centuries "
904,Couldn't say it better myself. I'd love to take the time to learn another language
904,I tend to have a scientific brain so they can be tricky to get my head around as they never follow a certain pattern.
904,Its interesting you say that because english is actually a pretty broken language in and of itself 
904,They say it is the most difficult language to learn as a second language due to it's lack of order. 
904,Yeah that is true. The only reason its spoken worldwide is because of Britain's history as a world power
904,I sometimes wonder if it is just because the English are so terrible at learning languages!
904,I mean all things considered that wouldn't surprise me at all
904,What is the most surprising thing you have found out recently?
904,Well I found out that English is a weird mix of german and french If you use the same sound for each vowel I saw a video on it 
904,That is interesting and it just made me try and sound words out!
905,thats grate
905,Did you do wrestling for entertainment or for competition.
905,yes i do
905,I was thriiled to find out that Wrestling dates back to early '50s
905,oh wow you are so thriiled 
905,Yeah! I am a big fan of wrestling 
905,good my favourite colour is blue
905,that's awesome ! ! mine is emerald green
905,nice thats also good colour i've one son
905,That's a great color
905,yes
905,do you enjoy coffee?
906,I draw my siblings.
906,"Nice, how many siblings do you have?"
906,I have 5!
906,Wow! That must have been a busy house growing up!
906,It really was.  Lots of laundry for my poor mom.
906,I can't even imagine! I cut down trees and there is always so much sawdust in my laundry!
906,"I ride a bike, and there is always mud on my clothes.  My wife does not like it haha"
906,"I bet not! Mud comes along with cutting the tress too, I try to avoid it as best I can!"
906,Have you found any solutions for getting dirt stains out of clothes?
906,The best thing I have found is to soak them prior to throwing them in the washer.
906,Very nice.  I will try that!
906,I hope it works! You can also google to see if there are any other ideas!
907,I like video games and cars.
907,"I like video games, too.  Although, I'm not so great at them.  Which ones do you like to play?"
907,I like super mario cart. What is your favorite video game?
907,"Oh, I love that one, too.  My most favorite was a computer MMO, Lord of the Rings."
907,"Cool. I like MMO as well, League of Legends."
907,"I've heard of that one, but never played it.  I also liked Silent Hill, way back in the day."
907,I have seen the movie Silent Hill. It was really scary.
907,"Yeah, I love scary movies, so the game was right up my alley.  I don't get to play much anymore now that I have kids."
907,That's too bad. You can still play it once in a while.
907,"Yes, I do still get to every now and then.  I can't complain.  I knew that once I had kids, I didn't get to be one anymore. ;)"
907,"Yeah, kids come with great responsibilities. But also great joys."
907,For sure.  We have good times.  I enjoy spending quality time with them.  They won't be little forever and then there will be plenty of me time.
908,"I wonder if there are other things effecting fertility, especially in the modern world "
908,"i'm not sure , but i believe your diet has some influence"
908,They used to say that diet specifically effected if you had a boy or a girl. It is odd to see what they used to believe. 
908,I am not sure I believe them most of the time though
908,I think most have them have been disproved by science now. Except alcohol decreasing fertility
908,That's an interesting theory that doesn't sound inaccurate. Nowadays Western culture often celebrate good news in groups by drinking a few. do you have children
908,Yes I do. They are grown up now though. What about you?
908,I have a daughter but she isn't married (yet). she is the apple of my eye
908,Aww that is lovely. Are you waiting for a proposal and marriage then?
908,"it all depends on here , are you married ?"
908,Yes 35 years. What about you?
908,i've been . it was a great
909,That is true and there's so many ways to practice and study the faith 
909,I am really not a religious person. I am present in there here and now and find happiness and peace in the little things in life.
909,Honestly what more can you ask for? I strive for that level of spiritualism in my daily life 
909,That is interesting. I like your perspective and that you strive for that.
909,Yeah. I think that I've struggled with personal peace in the past. I think your outlook would help with that
909,I understand and can relate it. I appreciate the positve words. Do you ever meditate?
909,No actually I don't currently. Do you think I should?
909,yes I think that it has a lot of health benefits but also it has a meditative and spiritual core
909,That does make sense. I've also heard that different types of exercise can sometimes help with that as well
909,Exercise is a good stress reliever and mood lifter.
909,Facts. I used to run a lot as a kid. the high would get was unbelievable
909,I started running again about 3 years ago. I definitely get it. It does feel good and also good for stress. 
910,Yes.  That is very interesting.
910,Do you enjoy video games?
910,Oh Yes. 
910,I love video games.
910,I also like video games.
910,Which platform do you use? ie. the electronic system used to play video games.
910,I use to playstation.
910,old or new version ? i love playing on both . did you get the new old system ?
910,I like only new version.
910,What is your favourite game?
910,My favorite game is god of war 5.
910,"I have never seen it nor played it. I do love God of war though, it's such a good game."
911,As long as you don't fall asleep. LOL
911,"That's awesome! They don't have them in Canada yet, hoping soon!"
911,It is a great car.  No gas cost and helping the environment. Win Win.
911,I agree! Seems like you like it so far. Any bad parts of it?
911,"The electric bill has gone up as well as the insurance cost. I still don't ""trust"" the autopilot completely."
911,So your home electric fuels the car? Yeah I don't know how comfortable I would be with the autopilot. 
911,Tesla has become really popular here. They are just very expensive.
911,"I wonder if the price will go down after they have been out for a while, I hope so at least.\"
911,Maybe.  
911,Do you like basketball? It's my favorite sport!
911,Basketball is okay.  I like gymnastics better.
911,"Gymnastics is cool. It seems really hard though, especially for me...I have no balance. "
912,even i. i work from home
912,That's awesome! Being able to work at your own pace must be great! I am going to school for writing.
912,thsts awsome
912,How much money do you make working from home?
912,50$ a day isnt it nice
912,That would be a welcome income for a poor college student studying writing. DO you have any hobbies?
912,yes i do i love to travel
912,Traveling scares me. I'm always afraid I won't be able to get back. Where is your favorite place to go?
912,my favorite place is banff its located in canada i just love that place and what about you?
912,"My favorite place I've ever been in Pensacola FL. Warm, lovely beaches. Alcohol and seafood!"
912,oh great! what is your hobby?
912,Writing. Who could have guessed from a girl studying writing aiming to go into journalism. I love to write fictional stories.
913,It is so much easier to loarn something young. Same with sports and other things. Much harder later in life.
913,"Agreed.  However, I made the most advancement later than usual when learning to read.  It was very hard for me."
913,Why do you think that was?
913,I had a learning disability that was mild enough to go unnoticed for several years in elementary school.
913,I have heard from a lot of people that they have experienced that. Did you get good help when it was noticed?
913,"Yes, in the 5th grade I had an amazing teacher that noticed the problem and helped me.  At the time, I read on about a 1st grade level."
913,I feel like most people remember their favourite teacher for the rest of their lives. They make such a difference.
913,I agree.  She was very special to me.  She even came to my wedding.
913,That is lovely! 
913,Her help was invaluable to me.  I am a great reader now and love to do it in any spare time I can find.
913,Reading is such a great escape from normal life. It is great that you had that support. 
913,"Yes, I agree.  I love fiction.  How about you?"
914,"No, this is her first illness. "
914,Well maybe it's due to her age. I'd take her to the vet maybe it isn't that serious
914,"yes, hopefully. I will take her in for a check up tomorrow. "
914,I'm sure she'll be okay. They don't say that cats have 9 lives for nothing
914,Lol agreed. She's my baby. Do you have any pets?
914,I have a great dane actually. She's a lot of work if I'm being honest
914,So I've heard. Great danes are really energetic
914,Yeah but there also pretty easy to train if they like you 
914,So I guess the battle is getting them to like you. Is it a boy or a girl?
914,A girl and actually its easier than you think. Sure they're stubborn but they're pretty gentle giants
914,"Aww, how old is she?"
914,um... I think she's a year and a half now. feels like forever
915,I would love to visit there.  I love chocolate so much! 
915,I have been there. The streetlights looks like hershey kisses.
915,That is so cool.  Do they have rides like roller coasters?
915,They do. It is all very cool.
915,That sounds like a great place to visit.  I should go sometime
915,You should. Where do you live?
915,In the west.  Nevada
915,I have been there. I like it. Do you live near Vegas?
915,"No, more in the north.  But I have been  many times"
915,I am getting ready to go to the gym. I meant to go earlier but I got distracted.
915,I spent my gym time watching anime.  
915,That works. I love the japanation or hand-drawn computer animation. Have you seen Cowboy Bebop?
916,really / how is the weather /
916,Not too bad right now but it gets really hot. I have been there in the summer and it is almost unbearable. 
916,wow! would love to visit there. what are some of the fun places ?
916,I would suggest Fiji it's so nice there I went in august! It is very touristy so there are tons of fun things to do. 
916,"ok , i prefer the caribian though "
916,Really? And why is that?
916,it just so foregin to me 
916,Is it a safe place to travel to these days though?
916,"i know , i see the travel agencies advertising them all the time"
916,"Hmm, that doesn't really answer my question. But if travel agencies advertise for that place I would hope it would be safe. "
916,"well i guess its safe, since there aren't any deterrents "
916,Are there any other places you would like to go? 
916,Europe for sure
917,I had him for over 10 years but when we moved he got and went missing. I was devastated but we did eventually find him.
917,"That's great, losing a pet would have been awful as I have recently got a pet myself which is the best aquaincence I could ever ask for."
917,Well make sure you get him chipped because that is the best way to find a lost pet.
917,"Most definitely! Being creative is forte as an artist as I do love my new pet, I will definitely get him chipped."
917,Yeah a lot of people consider their pets to be their children. I think pets have a huge impact on peoples life.
917,YES exactly! I agree and sometimes they're taken for granted. Luckily I was able to rescue a poor cat recently who was desperate. Have you ever rescued an animal?
917,When I was younger my neighbors kid threw a kitten into a creek in the middle of winter. I got her and nursed her back to health.
917,"WOW! That's perfection... I rescue animals as well.and have many more cats then that lol. It is very needed to help cats, like the cat I recently got."
917,"Cats do seem to be tossed out much more than dogs are, at least in my experience and i don't know why because cats can be awesome pets. "
917,"Maybe because domestication has to do with mutual relationships. I believe it as a painter, It always seems to me that we need cats more than they need us."
917,I owned a domesticated lynx house cat hybrid that lived to be 18 and i can for sure say she didn't need us at all most times haha.
918,"No, but it looks really bruised.  I might have to do a YouTube video on it later."
918,Oh no! I am sorry to hear that! Do you think maybe you should go to the doctor?
918,"It looks way worse than it feels, but I may need to keep an eye on it."
918,"I definitely would, but I'm no doctor, I didn't even finish high school. "
918,"I was thinking if I did a video, someone in the comments might know why it's so discolored."
918,That's an innovative way to use technology!
918,"Oh, it's crazy.  Someone always knows something you don't in the comments.  With my channel growing, there's bound to be someone that knows."
918,I am sure someone will be able to help you!
918,I hope so.  Actually I hope this bruise just starts looking better after I've had some sleep.
918,I hope so too. Have you iced it?
918,"Yeah, I've had ice on it all day.  Well, all day since it happened.  I've just been taking it easy now."
918,That's good! I would be laid up reading a good book if I hurt myself! I love reading!
919,"thats good, always good to love where you live"
919,yeah. my kids like it here too
919,thats good
919,How is ny treating you? What is your favourite part?
919,"New York is great, I also love it here. My favourite part would have to be Manhattan "
919,What do you normally do in your spare time therE?
919,I sometimes walk my pets 
919,"Dogs I assume, unless you have a rabbit on a lead? "
919,"Yes, I have two dogs"
919,What kind of dogs do you have
919,Two golden retrievers
919,They are such lovely dogs! Have you always had dogs?
920,What should I say to them?
920,I would check your messages anyway. It's better to know than to keep yourself hanging
920,I will. How do I help my friend through the breakup?
920,"Well, at the end of the day theres nothing anyone can do unless that person themselves wants the help :\"
920,"You're right, everyone deals with it in different ways."
920,Yeah for some people it's really hard to move on. Good thing there are psychologist. I'm stressed myself because of the three jobs that I've been working.
920,what jobs do you work?
920,"Just a few different jobs really, just anything that will get the bills paid. Is there anything you like to do in your free time?"
920,I'm very into fitness. How about you?
920,I like working out myself expect I'm more into walking for my exercise. I usually walk about two miles a day.
920,Walking is the best! I like to walk down by the lake.
920,Walking in nature is amazing and there are so many health benefits from walking!
921,I am very sorry about that.  I would be so sad if that happened in the area I live.
921,Luckily we have already mapped out National Parks and Forests to preserve a small part of the Earth. Do you have any of these near where you live?
921,There are some places like that near me. Several parks that are protected.
921,Can you purchase some sort of an entry pass for all the parks from the national park service?
921,"Yes, there are a few that require a pass that you purchase and a few that are paid for by taxes and free to enter."
921,"have you been to any of them? if so, how are they?"
921,"Yes, I've gone to most of them as there isn't much else to do in my area.  They are all nice and give you a taste of untouched Florida."
922,"He is so bad, I need to take him to some obedience training classes. "
922,That's always a good idea. Hopefully getting him some training will keep him in the house lol
922,Lol right. What kind of dog do you have?
922,He's some kind of pitbull mix. That's why I worry about him getting out. They're a bit misunderstood
922,"Yes, absolutely. They get a bad rep from the mainstream media. "
922,It's funny because all the ones I've had are terrified of everything
922,"Lol that's too cute. I want a pitbull puppy, but later in life. "
922,They adorable as puppies and they're really good family dogs
922,"So I've heard, I can't wait to get one. "
922,Honestly I want another one. My big guy seems like he's been getting bored lol
922,"lol yes, another one will probably bring him great joy. "
922,Absolutely. and it would be better than getting him a cat 
923,does that make good money?
923,I depends on the content and views I guess.
923,Just need to train my dogs to do something viral worthy. then I'd make it on youtube.
923,That would be one way. Pets doing stupid or interesting things is big.
923,Right? I wonder how many followers I would need.
923,I suppose you could google it. I'm sure there is an online guide.
923,"hmmm. looks like you need at least 1,000 to monetize the account. i think I'd rather spend my free time swimming. do you have any pets?"
923,"Sure. Two dogs, a cat and a parrot. How about you?"
923,Just my 4 dogs. They keep me busy but I love them.
923,I have four pets but being different species they each have unique quirks.
923,Must be nice to have the variety! I want to get a cat one day. A big fluffy one. Pets are the best.
923,Sure are. I don't know what I would do without them.
924,I love yellow. Something about it is calming and mood-lifting to me.
924,It reminds me of sinshine.
924,That makes sense. 
924,My wife used to wear yellow to work every Monday
924,Nice. Was there a specific reason she did that?
924,"She was a teacher, and it made her think positive about it being Monday"
924,I like that. That is a good approach. It is hard to feel positive about Mondays.
924,It started to rub off on her students and the day went better! 
924,That makes me smile. Talking to you has helped cheer me up a little. Thank you.
924,You are so welcome! 
924,Do you ever feel down?
924,Sometimes.  I have to try and think positively to cheer myslef up
924,"Yes, thinking positive does help."
925,What genre do you like reading?
925,Fantasy is my favorite.  JRR Tolkien is my favorite author.
925,Lord of the Rings?
925,"Yes, and The Hobbit."
925,Did you like the movies as well?
925,"Mostly.  I really loved The Lord of the Rings movies.  The Hobbit movies weren't as good, but I still enjoyed them."
925,"I agree. The books are always better than the movies too, sometimes it can be a let down."
925,"Yes, I also agree.  What is your favorite genre for reading?"
925,I like Fantasy as well as Romance. I don't have much time anymore to read for fun which is sad.
925,"Oh, that is sad.  But I understand.  I have a hard time making time for it, too, now that I have children."
925,Aw! how many do you have?
925,"Two boys, six and four.  Do you have any children?"
926,"I'm not, Just realize that it's bad for the environment. I like rock as well, my favorite band is Muse!!!"
926,I love Muse! Have you ever been to a rock concert?
926,"Oh yeah, they are so much fun! So, what do you do for a living?"
926,I am currently a student studying computer engineering. I'm sort of a nerd haha. How about you?
926,"Studying is awesome, wish I could go back to school. Right now I just work for Walmart. I mostly just stock the shelves."
926,You still have time my friend! Did you know Sams Club is owned by Walmart?
926,"Yep, it's really interesting that they own a both stores! What kind of job are you looking for after graduation?"
926,I would like to be a part of a company that makes a difference. I am not too fond of the silicon valley giants out there.
926,"Oh I totally understand, I really need to find a job outside of the big box stores, just hard finding jobs these day.s"
927,It is heartbreaking especially when children are involved.
927,"It is, but we can learn from them and not do the same thing."
927,Agreed.  Communication is vital in a marriage. 
927,"Yes, interpersonal communication is the most important factor in any relationship."
927,And putting the other's needs ahead of your own can help a marriage survive as well
927,That is true. That is real love and loyalty.
927,Are you married? 
927,I am not married. Are you?
927,I am not.  I have been married 3 times though
927,Interesting. I have never been married. Are you looking to get married again?
927,Probably not.  
927,"I have a crush on my volleyball coach, but he is married."
928,I prefer Planes
928,"Have you ever flown one? A totally different experience, it's so freeing!"
928,"yeah, different feels. How many times you are going to planes"
928,"I fly a few times per year. I grew up in Indiana and my family and friends still live there, so I have to fly to visit them."
928,"Hm, i fly few times to watching cricket matches"
928,That's really cool. 
928,"Then, mostly like the places you are"
928,I am happy with it. I get to see the United States.
928,I'm also happy see the united states and play golf
928,Golf? I could never get into it. I play guitar. 
928,"Hm, I like that play the guitar"
928,Do you play any instruments?
929,I'm not a fan of it!
929,I can respect that. so what kind of movies do you like?
929,I'm more of a drama/comedy fan. What about you?
929,Well as much as I like a good horror film I'm also pretty into comic book movies. I've watched a few dramas here and there too
929,"I like the suspenseful horror movies, but not the ""boo"" scary ones. "
929,Honestly same. Like the jump scares and stuff are too straight forward
929,Yeah and I feel like they aren't authentic. Man I wish 
929,Exactly its always missing something. Have you seen Hush?
929,"It sounds familiar, but I don't think I have seen it. I wish I didn't have to work and could just watch movies all day!"
929,Facts honestly. But if you get a chance its about this deaf writer and she ends up trapped in her house by a killer and is trying to survive/escape
929,Sounds interesting!! I will look into it! Thank you!
929,No problem It's a really good take on the basic serial killer horro movie
930,That's a good way of looking at it.  I've been repairing cars for so long that I'm not even worried about the job itself.
930,I definitely need to learn how to take care of cars.
930,I've been doing it since I was little.  It was something my father showed me.
930,With all the road trips I take with my animals It would be a valuable trade to learn!
930,Oh definitely.  I've got a German Shepard that loves road trips.  
930,"I have a friend who has one of those! Very very smart and playful. I am looking to get a dog soon, for now we just have 2 cats."
930,"My girl, Ginger is great.  She's so smart and playful and she gets along great with the cats. "
930,Such great dogs. We have a cat for now to take care of any vermin in the house which my dog wasn't able to back before she passed.
930,Cats are very useful and great to have around.  They are so easy to take care of too.  Mine walk around like they own the place.
930,I so wish I could be a cat... ohhh how easy life would be!
930,"I think the same thing every time I head out the door for work and see them all sprawled out without a care in the world, haha."
930,"Hah, that reminds me of Sylvester & Tweety. Cats are also valued for their companionship."
931,"Wow, I also live in New York. "
931,I love it although it can be crowded.
931,Yes. what city do you live in? I'm in Harlem.
931,I'm in Queens. Tough getting around sometimes. Good I like the night.
931,"Yeah, it's hard to find any good fishing spots, my only gripe. "
931,Yeah. I'm from Texas. I used to fish for bass all the time. Only on vacations now.
931,I'm so jealous. I used to fish with my uncle but he's deceased now. 
931,That's too bad. I fished with my grandfather but he is gone too. Just my friends now.
931,I may have to find some fishing friends. Or force my son to go with me lol
931,You should take your son. Get him off his phone.
931,Lol you are absolutely right. He's glued to that thing. 
931,Kids don't get out anymore. I used to spend all my free time as a kid outside.
932,You're right. I just freeze under pressure sometimes.
932,i am comoany owner  i like apple juice
932,"As the owner, what characteristics would you like in an employee?  "
932,daily time correct atten in office
932,It's hard to be on time when traffic is bad.
932,time missing traval
932,Do you have to travel far for work?
932,it's a six to seven hours travel time
932,That seems like a lot.
932,yes
932,I only have to travel one hour each way.
932,i like flight in travel daily
933,"Definitely! I feel it's very important to always continue learning, it's even fun when you're not obligated to due dates and homework assignments. Why do you stay up so late?"
933,I am learning computer programming and it is very time consuming sometimes. Also i play PC games way to long.
933,I love PC gaming! It's nice to wind down after a long day of work and get lost in games - what are some of your favorites?
933,I play a lot of league of legends and call of duty when i want pvp. If i want story lately I have been playing through final fantasy XV.
934,Had to have a tow company take it to a mechanic. I need to be a mechanic to save money! Are you a mechanic?
934,ummer in 5th grade i broke my nose and helped my dad fix our car so i know a little. I would have preferred to read twilight at that age
934,Being in the fifth grade and getting an early start on learning is great but it's better to follow your passions. Is twilight your favorite book?
934,"For sure one of my favorites, but I agree- always follow your passion!"
934,I like to read Anne Rice and the Twilight series too!
934,Love anne rice! I remember my mother reading those when i was younger.
934,I prefer queen instead of interview but the entire series is good. My mother would read Bully or true crime novels.
934,Yes! True crime novels are my second favorite genre. Half Price Books is a great place to get some new ones
934,I'll need to check them out. There are some gems to be found in thrift and dollar stores too!
934,"You never know what treasures are out there! I will have to check out dollar stores for books though, good idea!"
934,Not a problem! I hope your collection grows as big as the Library of Alexandria's one day!
934,Thank you! I do too oh my gosh! lol
935,I like to bake and eat cookies! 
935,Do you watch any cooking shows?
935,"I do, many.  My favorite is Master Chef."
935,I've never seen that. I like Jacques Pepin and America's Test Kitchen.
935,This one features home cooks.  It is judged my Gordon Ramsey.  Do you like Baking Shows?
935,I like any cooking show. I find Gordon Ramsey to be too abusive though.
935,I agree.  This show he is alot tamer.  I like to watch him make pasta.  Have you made pasta from scratch before? 
935,Sure. I have the manual machine. It's easy. You can do gnochi without a machine.
935,"I have not tried gnochi.  I have done lasagna sheets, fettuccini and spaghetti"
935,Google a gnochi recipe made with flour and baked potatoes. It is pretty easy and really good.
935,"Thank you, I will!"
935,The sauce is important though. I make homemade marinara usually.
936,He is terrifying! It's funny how I'm a huge horror movie fanatic but they still scare me so much lol
936,I love scary movies. I remember watching the first paranormal activity movie with all the lights off. I was checking corners for the next week.
936,Oh i hate/love that feeling after watching a horror movie when you're constantly checking behind you for ghosts and murders.
937,Hi. How are you doing today? I hope all is well
937,I'm great how are you doing?
937,I am too. I just start the new workout at the gym that has my looking super good.
937,that is good ! i am sure you keep in great shape
937,"Thanks, do you do any workout routines or keep yourself in shape?"
937,"no , i only concentrate on my weight lifting ."
938,That's okay! What is your native language? English is mine but I'd love to learn others!
938,"I am from Russia! That's why I am so into weights, we love challenge other friends to benchpress more!"
938,I used to take weightlifting classes in the city! My highest squat weight is 205 pounds. Have you seen St. Petersburg?
938,my top was 345 but i have only done that once. I have not seen it. Is it worth the trip maybe I add it to my list!
938,That's alot of weight! Is there a goal your looking forward to?
938,No goal! as long as i keep up my daily workout i am fine. I would like to focus on other things for now like traveling to new place!
938,"I bet traveling is wonderful! I've been to England, Germany and Italy but I'd love to see Russia as well!"
938,Italy is on the bucket list too. Have you travelled to Ireland?
938,Not Ireland but I've been to Aberdeen Scotland. Have you been to Ireland?
938,I was there for a while when on tour with my weightlifting group. How did you like scottland?
938,"It's beautiful: the castles, landscape and the people! Have you received any awards with your weightlifting group?"
938,Not yet but I always have hope someday I will! I am glad to hear the people are nice I look forward to visiting
938,Good luck and keep going you'll get those awards!
939,well I used to have a cat but she sadly died
939,Sorry to hear that. I've had several pets die over the years. It's always tough.
939,that is sad to hear. I'm over her death now
939,"Me too. A long time ago. Now I have two dogs, a cat and a parrot."
939,do your dogs eat your food
939,I try to keep them on really good dog food but I can't help feeding them some of what I'm eating.
939,when i turned vegetarian. my cat stopped eating my food.
939,That would do it. One of my dogs will eat broccoli.
939,My cat could not sleep at night so I would always be awake to
939,That would be annoying but I bet you put up with it.
939,It was alright as i usually worked at night
939,That would be a reason for a cat to keep you up if you sleep during the day. My dogs would not let me sleep.
940,"yes, I am very happy with that"
940,"Wow, thats fatastic. I hope its a better situation for you at work and a nice little raise to go along with it"
940,what is your job?
940,i work as an editor for a newspaper and do some free lance poetry
940, that is awesome!! have you been promoted in your work?
940,"i am hoping to receive one soon, that way i can take a vacation to the UK. I always wanted to go there"
940,I would have liked to work for a newspaper 
940,what do you do for work? do you enjoy it?
940,I am accountin. I like my job
940,that is awesome. i bet you get a lot of tax questions then
940,"yes, i have a lot of work in the first semester of the year. I want to go to Europe next month for relax"
940,that would be awesome. there is so much to see there
940,have you visited europe?
941,"Yes, I would love to go do that soon."
941,Apple picking is so fun with the family.  I try to find the green apples. They are my favorite.
941,"Mine too! I am in nursing school and my schedule is crazy busy, but I always try to eat a green apple for breakfast."
941,"I bet you have a busy schedule.  Nursing is such a demanding job, but rewarding job."
941,"Yes, I do. I work and go to school and am also a singer in a band and we play shows a few nights a week. Nursing really is rewarding."
941,"That is a lot.  If you can find the time, apple picking is the best.  I love the fall season."
941,I want to make the time. I also love fall. I like how it smells and how the air feels. 
941,"Yes, I love the cooler weather.  It is a nice change."
941,I agree. Maybe we can go apple picking together.
941,Sounds great.  I like to make applesauce and pies with mine.
941,That sounds good. We should go apple picking and make a pie.
941,My husband loves apple pie.
942,I believe the birth certificate. 
942,I go to hawaii often on holiday. I can believe he is  from hawaii
942,I have never been there. I would love to go. Where is Trump from?
942,I have no clue
942,I think it might be New York City. He seems like a New Yorker. 
942,Maybe so. Actually before he was president he was a television personality and businessman.
942,"And known for being a cheating husband, yet, they still marry him, don't they?"
942,well... He is rich. I would marry him for all the beach holidays I would get
942,"I might, if I could deal with the press and the talk about my family all the time. Could you deal with it?"
942,probably couldn't. I would stay away from press and stick to boating in remote areas
942,I don't think Trump cares about boating. I would spend my time abroad. 
942,Where abroad??
943,So interesting. I would love to take my wife for manicures but she would prefer to go on vacations LOL. Our favorite is to go scubadiving. 
943,I would love to do scubadiving! But the idea of fish being all around me freaks me out for some reason LOL
943,"Me too the first time, but you get used to it! I used to go horseback riding. You should try scuba!"
943,horseback riding sounds so fun too! I would love to go on those clear boats where you can see all the sharks around you
943,OH man that actually sounds amazing! I haven'
943,It's weird i'm freaked out by tiny fish being all around me but I'd LOVE to swim with sharks or dolphins haha
943,Have you tried the pedi with the fish eating your skin?
943,Nope! My friends actually all did that a few weeks ago in Mexico..while I stood aside and recorded everything LOL freaked me out way too much
943,"I agree with you- now, I like scuba diving, but fish biting my feet is too far!"
943,Apparently it softens up your skin to a whole new level! So maybe I'll need to muster the courage up to try lol. Have you ever been skydiving?
943,"YES, if you haven't tried you NEED too! What a rush!"
943,I haven't yet! My boyfriend's been trying to convince me to go - well he jumps out of planes for a living LOL. It sounds like such a rush though
944,I need to improve my voice for auditions.
944,What are you auditioning for?
944,Anything in New York I can get. I'm a terrible dancer though.
944,My mothers both work in the music industry. Maybe you could talk and they can give you advice or maybe some connections.
944,Anything that helps is good. I'm doing the cliche waiting tables for now.
944,I hear you. Yout gotta do what you gotta do. I am proud of you for working towards your dreams.
944,I feel like I need to go sit at a soda fountain counter and maybe I'll get discovered like some Hollywood actress of yore.
944,Good idea. It will happen. You are charismatic and likable and very dedicated.
944,I wish that was all it took. Some luck would help.
944,"Yeah for sure. Luck only gets you so far, the rest is up to you, and I know you have been working hard."
944,So what do you do?
944,"My mothers wanted me to work in the music industry with them, but it wasn't my thing. I am an RF Engineer."
945,Thats true
945,"After the kids long soccer games, I use sewing to wind down."

945,No I have not been to Paris. But its my bucket list. I heard its a beautiful city
945,It's on my bucket list as well. I can't wait to get the chance to go.
945,Yes. Need a break from all this work and take a break
945,"Yes between work and my kids soccer games, Paris looks like only a dream."
945,Dont say that. You never know 
945,Hopefully one day
946,it was an nice joke but it won't happen bro because all our thoughts are only dreams it will dissapair as an streamline
946,I'd be a penguin. Or a pickle. As a joke of course!

947,I called my mom because i was scared
947,oh my goodness that sounds bad did you call the police ?
947,i should have but no
947,That is so scary.  Maybe you could look into the security camera devices that are available now.
947,I was extremely shooken up. do you think the office would look into the cameras for me without getting the police involved?
947,I think they would.  Did your roommates hear anything unusual?
947,i dont want to get the police involved and then find out it was just a racoon or something.unfortunately I live here alone 
947,I would definetly ask the office about the cameras then.  
947,"i will do that. im gonna take a look around my window, maybe ill find something."
947,You could always get a stick to place in the window so it cannot be slid open.  
947,thats a good idea. im walking to the office now. how has ur day been going?
947,"Great, but busy!"
948,YES
948,"Originally the show was going to be called Spongeboy Ahoy, back in my day in the 40s i heard that."
948,"To voice the character of SpongeBob, Hillenburg approached Tom Kenny, who had worked with him on Rocko's Modern Life"
948,I didn't know that! that's good informationp. What do you like to do besides watching tv?
948,Go for a bike ride.
948,"I have an elliptical in my home. I like to cook and bake in my spare times, stew specifically. Where do you bike at?"
948," It's no secret that when you ride a lot, you get very good at cycling."
948,How long have you done it for?
948,For about four years. This is a lone without any contexts. 
948,"Maybe you should try a motorcycle with three wheel, with a sidecar, it is more stable."
948," Better traffic visibility is a motor trike safety plus, but 3-wheelers have their"
948,Anything on only 2-3 wheels scare me! Have you drove one?
949,No. Very few of us showed. It was fun anyway. 
949,I had my 20th class Reunion a few years ago. Most could barely recognise me apart from the few who know me as a yoga instructor
949,"Wow, yoga. I love yoga, but I'm a beginner. You must have looked great. "
949,"it was nice, i was in a organization called young friends of the arts"
949,Sounds interesting. I'm not into the arts. I enjoy training dogs. 
949,I like dogs. I wrote a poem about my Dog. It even got published
949,Yoga and writing. Nice. I have a headache. I need a Coke for the caffiene. 
949,I think you need medicine and a good nights rest
949,"Yep, but work keeps me up late sometimes. "
949,"I feel your pain. I used to work late but now as a yoga instructor, I have flexible working times"
949,That sounds so good. I'd love to have a flexible schedule. You're fortunate. 
949,I have to train every day though. I need to keep in shape
950,In France the health coverage is quite good
950,"So I have heard, my mother is a nurse and she is alway talking about other countries and their coverage options!"
950,Does she work at a hospital? In what country does she work?
950,Yeah. She works at a dialysis clinic here in the U.S
951,They used tweezers to pull it out
951,Just thinking about that hurts!
951,I couldn't watch it happen. Have you had any similar injuries?
951,"I've had plenty of splinters, but I cannot imagine an ingrown toenail."
951,That's lucky. I recently broke my ankle and I am in a cast.
951,"Wow!  When I was younger, I fell running and broke my arm. How is your ankle doing?"
951,Hopping over a fence.
951,How tall was the fence?
951,Not tall. But it was very rainy out.
951,Sorry to hear that.  How much longer do you have to be in the cast?
951,Not sure yet. I have an appointment on Friday to find out. Fingers crossed it isn't more than three months.
951,Let's hope for the best.  I went to the doctor recently for a cold; I've been taking Vitamin C to see if it helps.
952,Thank you for your kind words that really means a lot
952,"Of corse, i hope to change the world with my kind words lol"
952,I wis I could also.  
952,Besides using uplifting words I like to tell jokes too.. that wont cure any gerif but it will make you smile!
952,I love funny jokes that will make me laugh and smile.  
952,"I do too.. i don't like jokes that are long and involved like a story, with a really silly ending.  Like a pun :("
952,Lol.  Yeah jokes can be long but all that the same time bore
952,Right! So do you plan on getting a new hamster or are you taking it easy for now?
952,I'm taking it easy for now.  I
952,"That's understandable, must be hard. I had a hamster when I was a kid, her name was tinkerbell. What was your's name?"
952,Sam.
952,Haha! That is so cute!
952,keep chatting 
953,I have not ran that much total in the past few months. I really want to make myself proud
953,I've been injured so I'm just getting back into it.
953,My girlfriend was persuading me not to run as she thinks I wont be able to handle the heat
953,If it is hot where you are you can run in the evenings or early morning.
953,it is extremely hot even in the mornings and evenings. My girlfriend can be very persuasive.I still love her regardless
953,"Well. I guess you need to say ""yes dear"" and take up swimming or something."
953,swimming. I'm scared of water
953,"I like playing around in a pool, a lake, the ocean or wherever but I don't like to actually swim."
953,same
953,Do you run for exercise or to compete?
953,I mostly run in the morning but in the evenings I got to the gym
953,I was going to suggest spinning or Tae Bo or something.
954,No idea. I didn't deserve that. 
954,No one deserves that for no reason. How are you dealing with it?
954,"I'll get over it. I keep busy. Like soon, I have to go pick up my little sister. She's in the first grade. "
954,Kids are a great way to keep your mind off of things! Little sisters can be company to go out and adventure with.
954,"Yeah, I have 4 siblings. They are a blast to hang out with. Do you have any?"
954,"Yes, I have one, but I have four kids. Two are grown and two are school age. They hold each together when they need someone."
954,That is so nice. I can't imagine having 4 kids. I have one and one is enough!
954,"Yes, We just moved from the beach. We fished and spent the summer at the beach. It was good family time."
954,I once lived 10 minutes from the Gulf. It was such a nice place to live. I miss it. What beach did you visit?
954,We lived in Corpus Christi. We fished on Padre Island. Where did you live?
954,"Lake Jackson, TX. I managed a resturant there and spent days off at Surfside Beach. I love Padre Island. "
954,My grandma lives in Freeport. I spent my childhood summers there! I love it.
955,even i like story writting
955,"I used to like it, now that's all I do."
955,would you like to spent time on social network?
955,I try to but I can't seem to put my pens down. I enjoy writing more than typing.
955,"yep, me too i like to draw rather then typing"
955,I have never been good at drawing. I do collect pens though.
955,"I like to paiting too, I have lots of my own  painting at my home"
955,Cool! What kind of things do you paint.
955,I like to do more modern art
955,I love modern art. Are you pretty good at it?
955,"yep, what kind of pens do you have?"
955,Every ball point pen that was ever created 
956,My grandma was an avid shopper and bought me many roses.
956,That's beautiful for sure. So where are you from?
956,"I'm from the UK, although I'd like to go to the US. What about you?"
956,"I'm from the US> I live in Michigan, Sterling Heights. Whats it like living in the UK?"
956,Pretty rainy to be honest - love the rain though so can't complain. Have you ever visited other countries?
956,No! I would love to go and really even see all of Europe since British culture has influenced it so much. So do what do you like to do?
956,"Europe is a beautiful place, I've traveled all over as part of my lifestyle blogging. I'm deeply into art and photography. What are your hobbies? "
956,I really enjoy movies myself. I love the Titanic! Art and Photography is amazing though!
956,"Thank you! Titanic is great, I've probably seen it a hundred times (it's on TV every Christmas). Are you looking forward to Christmas?"
956,"Mah it's ok, not really much into Christmas."
956,"Fair enough, I guess I'm still a big kid. What's your favourite food?"
956,"Not really sure lol, usually just eat what is around. The food in UK must be great though!"
957,oh no. Was your husband okay?
957,"Yes, I can only imagine! Thank goodness he wasn't and that he will be ok!"
957,Thanks goodness. Did he have to take time off work ?
957,"Luckily no, but it could have been a worse situation if a bigger accident happened."
957,Yea glad to hear he is okay. How is your job going?
958,I would love to go to Jamaica. I don't travel alot
958,It is so beautiful.  I am going to Barbados next month.  Why do you not travel as much?
958,It's to expensive.  But we are planning a cruise next year
958,That sounds like fun.  What ports are y'all looking to explore?
958,We are going to the Bahamas.  I can't remeber the other 4 places
958,I haven't been to the Bahamas yet.  Will this be your first cruise?
958,No actually my 2nd cruise.
958,I would love to go on a cruise.  How are they?
958,They are very nice. OMG.  My children and I feel in love.  They are ready to go back
958,I bet they are.  I don't have any children yet.  
958,Oh okay.  Yeah I have 4 beautiful kids
958,That's wonderful.  How old are they?
959,"it has been good, what about yours"
959,"It's ok, just got off from my diner job, on my way to my brothers cupcake shop here soon. What are you plans tonight?"
959,"Probably prepare for work tomorrow, take some time to relax and clean the house a bit. How do you like your job?"
959,"Love being a server, but running my own buisness with my brother is a pain. Just trying to pay off school debt! Relaxation sounds great LOL"
959,Why is it a pain?
959,"We are both so hardheaded when it comes to thinking up new ideas for flavors we always clash, just like when we were kids."
959,"That is unfortunate, it is important to be able to compromise."
960,He is 9 and he finally learned how to fetch. 
960,"Wow, that is a big accomplishment. Great job. What kind of dog is he?"
960,A chihuaha. Do you have a dog?
960,"Yes, two miniature dachshunds and a chocolate lab. They are trouble together."
960,I bet. One dog is enough adventure for me. Any other pets?
960,A chameleon. My daughter's impulse purchase. You?
960,"Not anymore. We had a cockatiel for awhile, but she flew off when the neighbor opened my door. My son was upset!"
960,I can understand. Kids attach so easily to pets. My lab is my baby though.
960,"My dog is the baby of the family, too. He likes to hear me play the piano. "
960,"That is awesome! My lab only has three legs, but he is very active"
960,Poor thing! I guess he doesn't even miss that leg. 
960,"No, he still goes hiking with us. He like my husband playing guitar too."
961,"it can be, what do you like doing?"
961,dance takes over most of my life but in my spare time i like to watch movies
961,"oh ok, whats the most recent movie youve seen?"
961,action movies . . it all depended on my mood . you ?
961,i prefer movies with a moral as i can use that when im teaching.
961,Action movies often have morals as a high schooler I have learnt a lot from action movies
961,"true, i enjoy those action movies! so what kind of dance do you do?"
961,I like more recent break dance type dances
961,"thats cool, do you perform professionally?"
961,yes. you can see me dancing in some hip hop videos
961,"ah ok, anyone i'd have heard of?"
961,lil wayne
962,How is that working for you?
962,It's going okay. I have a few dates a month. trying to take it slow to be honest. Trying to focus on finding a good woman lol. how about you?
962,I haven't dated in a long time. Found the man of my dreams and stuck with him. Are you looking to marry?
962,"I'm not even looking for anything serious like marriage, just a friend that I can relate to romantically."
962,"That sounds fun. Although I am married, we are open to have romantic friends"
962,Very nice. What do you look for in a partner? Personally I would like to find someone who enjoys cooking. I'm kind of a health nut. 
962,"I do enjoy cooking very much. As long as I have some one to listen and encourage me, I'm fine."
962,"Yeah, I totally understand that. Having someone to listen to me and encourage me would be amazing. So do you have any hobbies or a job?"
962,Yes my hobby is upholstery and I have turned that passion into a career for myself.
962,Wow that will surely be a rewarding career.
962,It has been for years now
962,Do you like nice upholstery or the work of providing furniture or seats?
963,"thats a shame, i loved them. so what do you do in your spare time? i love to run."
963,I play volleyball with some friends. Gotta get that exercise in after work. Doing admin work can get very boring
963,"exactly! this is why i run, keeps me fit and gives me some time alone to think about the day"
963,I often try to run in the mornings but I hate going into work out of breath and drained
963,"i find running gives me energy, wakes me up! what sort of distances do you run?"
963,i used to run marathons
963,"i run marathons too! i try to get in at least a couple each year, which was your last?"
963,My last one was the London marathon
963,"great event that, i've done it twice! i did Chicago and the two cities marathon this summer."
963,How do they compare to London
963,"same distance, hahaha. theyre great, not as intense as London and the weather is generally good. "
963,London weather is really random. One day I went outside with my paperwork on a dry day. 5 mintues later it started raining heavily
964,"I was supposed to go on a skiing trip, but it's been canceled."
964,"Well, maybe it can be rescheduled?"
964,I hope so.  I love to ski; have you ever been?
964,"No, I don't care for the cold weather being from the south. Besides, I'm busy studying. I speak 6 languages. "
964,"I am from the South, also.  I also like to go outside and skate.  What languages do you speak?"
964,"English, Spanish, French, Russian, German, and Navajo. Do you speak any other languages?"
964,That is an impressive list.  I speak English and Korean.  
964,Have you ever been to Korea?
964,"Yes, I went last year on a business trip.  What do you study?"
964,I study languages. What Korean dish would you recommend for me to eat? I like to cook. 
964,"You have to make bulgogi.  You can eat it by itself, with vegetables, or rice."
964,Now I'm hungry. I'll have to look that up and try it. Thanks.
965,did you? I did not find it appealing 
965,What did you not like about it?
965,"the concept of it. but I did like radioactive, That was a great hit"
965,I guess not all songs can be a hit like Radioactive!
965,right. I also bummed because I did not pass this cooking audition :(
965,Was it your first time for the audition?
965,"yes, but I am a great cook. That's a fact. Do you like cooking?"
965,"Yes, I do. I don't get a chance to do it much. What's your favorite thing to cook?"
965,I cook everything but I love Italian food.
965,Italian food is good. Do you add a lot of garlic to yours?
965,nope. Sometimes you dont need garlic if you use onions/scalions :)
965,Good point! I guess I don't think about onions or scallions often. Do you bake deserts?
966,"Yes that must be very emotionally tense, as for my case I tend to get very frustrated whilst driving with my daughters."
966,Children can be a driving distraction.
966,"Yes, they can be very distracting. My 2 daughters are very noisy as they anger me."
966,That's why the summer is brutal because they are always around. By September it's time for school and no more entertaining them.
966,"Oh yes! However, the drive to school is no fun. Just makes me more angry when my daughters argue with each other."
966,That's why I gave mine tablets so they can play games and watch shows.
966,"Yes, I suppose that would work and make me less frustrated during the daily drive to school and I'm pretty sure that my daughters would appreciate that."
966,I think that would be healthy for everyone involved. How old are your children?
966,"My youngest daughter is 4 and my oldest daughter is 6. Although they are very adorable, they can make me very angry whilst driving them."
967,Do you drink whiskey often?
967,"On occasion, when I'm really feeling it. I'm more of a collector."
967,"Oh cool, what do you collect?"
967,Single malt scotch. I'm really fascinated by its taste and texture
967,oh interesting. I don't collect anything myself but both my parents are school teachers and are collectors too 
967,That's amazing. What do they like to collect?
968,"Haha, thank you. Are you good at dancing?"
968,"No, but I am good at math."
968,"I'm so bad at math...sometimes I have to help my son with his homework, and I hate that."
968,Helping him will also help you.
968,"I guess so. Do you like math, or are you just good at it?"
968,I'm planning on being an engineer so it's a bit of both. 
968,"Oh, that's so cool! Do you go to school?"
968,Yes I'm currently in school but starting an internship soon.
968,That's great! Best of luck to you. I hope I can go back to school when my kids are a little older.
968,How old are your kids?
968,"3 and 7. One is in elementary school, but I stay at home with the youngest for now"
968,I guess daycare is pretty expensive.
969,"They probably do, somewhere! You can find nearly any cuisine there you want."
969,"I wonder if they have anything different, I wonder if anyone has tried to make meatloaf with tofu instead."
969,I'm not sure I'd want to give that a try! Do you like tofu?
970,Whatever works for you!
970,I can't say it has worked for me though. I have believed myself a ruler of the world but still live in this box.
970,I think we all feel that way at some point.
970,Right! But the difference with me is I just think about myself and no one else really. People consider it a social and cultural problem.
970,I can't say I relate to that. How do you feel about it?
970,"At first I didn't like it, but honestly as time and the years go by, I feel like we are more and more cohesive."
970,Who is we? I thought you only cared about yourself.
970,"Sorry, I call myself we when I had one too many drinks. I have the ability to care for others on occasion."
970,LOL. Sort of like the Royal We. What are you drinking?
970,"Yes, the Royal we! I am drinking Modelo because thats what my coworkers at roofing inc. drink."
970,I hope they don't drink while doing the Roofing!!
970,"Lol well some people can sneak in drinks but I'm not too sure if its allowed. I usually just order a tea, which they do have."
971,"i work for a beer distributor, long hors but good fun. what are you studying?"
971,I am studying accounting. Beer distribution does sound like so much fun
971,"so you can count the beers i sell, lol. it is good fun. what do you get up to outside of school?"
971,Yes I could lol. I attend bars for fun when I'm not studying
971,"ah, the perfect customer, ahaha. i try to get out when i can too, im a closet taylor swift fan, so try to get to see her when i can"
971,I love her too. She is awesome!!!
971,favourites tracks?
971,I love I kissed a girl 
971,"great song, my favourites are shake it off and bad blood, the 1989-2014 album is great."
971,"I meant naughty by nature, not Katy Perry's song"
971,"haha, didnt even notice that!"
971,Sorry about that. I can be a ditz sometimes
972,In my families restruant that i work at we actually did a green eggs and ham day and it was a big hit!
972,"Oh wow, actual green eggs and ham that you can eat?"
972,"Yes, the trick is just green food dye lol, tastes all the same! DO you enjoy sports at all?"
972,"I'm not really into sports, but I love going to the gym. I've taken up cooking recently too which comes in handy when family comes over"
972,I have recently gotten into sports. Love the Celtics! What do you like to cook?
972,"Steak and potatoes are my favorite, next to homemade burgers. But I make the best spaghetti. Nothing fancy, but damn tasty"
972,"Spaghetti is the bomb, always. Do you mix your sauce meat and noodles all in the pot or is it seprate bowls self serve style?"
972,I mix it all together. What's your favorite food
972,"steak fajitas for sure, spaghetti is a top 5 though!"
972,I nearly set fire to my kitchen one time whilst making spaghetti - I was a pretty dumb chef 5 years ago. Where abouts are you living?
972,"OMG lol, that's terrible! I am in Texas at the moment!"
972,"Cheers from across the pond! I'm in the UK, although looking to move to the US for engineering work in a year or two."
973,that's awesome! Do you spend a lot of time there?
973,i do! it's a lot of fun but it can be tiring sometimes
973,I can imagine. what kind of restaurant do they own?
973,"kind of a general place. it's popular for lunch, a lot of soup and sandwiches and stuff, and desserts. soul food i guess?"
973,yummy.! I would love to own a restaurant but I am sure it is a lot of work.
973,"it is! i enjoy it though. cooking is my favorite thing. what do you like to do in your free time, any hobbies?"
973,eating! Jk :) I love to dance
973,Haha! :) Guess you will have to try our BLT sometime. What kind of dancing?
973,"yes, please :) I love salsa."
973,That sounds so fun!! I'm not very good at dancing 
973,what do you like doing?
973,"Just cooking, mostly. But I do like to read when I'm not at the restaurant"
974,"It's a nice place to visit, but living here is a different story. I miss the simple life. "
974,I bet you had culture shock. My parents also visited NY last year; it was their 40th wedding anniversary.
974,"Wow, 40 years. Nice. I hope my wife and I make it that long. We've been married 3.5 years. Are you married?"
974,"Yes, I'm married.  We are going on 5 years.  I met my wife at a bookstore.  How did you meet yours?"
974,We met scuba diving. We both love it. What do you two do together? 
974,"Scuba diving sounds fun.  We do two book clubs together.  One is for non-fiction, and one is for fiction. We also travel."
974,We also love to travel and I'm a reader. Where was your last trip to?
974,We traveled to South Africa and are planning a trip to Ireland next year. How about y'all?
974,"Wow! We went to Grand Canyon last summer. I lived there for 5 years, so we went back to see friends. Ireland! That sounds great. "
974,We would love to do a cross country road trip.  Grand Canyon sounds fun.  
974,It was a great place to live. I could see the canyon from my office window. I miss it. 
974,That sounds like quite a view.  How does it compare to the NY skyline?
975,"Wow, that is great! I tend to collect a lot of antique things myself, particularly in the victorian era. My favourite collection is of two things."
975,What are the two things you collect?
975,Pedal-Driven Bicycles and Dolls.
975,I use to have one of those bicycles but it was stolen. 
975,Oh dear! I am very sorry to hear about that. I have still kept mine from since I was a small child.
975,How large is your collection of dolls?
975,I've got about 34 Dolls.
975,That's quite the collection. Where do you find the dolls?
975,"I have kept them since I was a child, that is why they have a lot of value to me."
975,Do you ever go to antique stores or auctions?
975,I used to but since I'm old now I don't really intend to driving around and going to stores.
975,Who will give your collections to when you pass away?
975,You.
976,I have. I believe Ive learn those in college
976,Its a concept that can venture many ways. How in-depth do you know what the process is about?
976,not much. tell me more about it
976,Well that start the process by connecting electrodes to measure activity
976,"do you like painting outdoors? I love it, I am trying to fix my fence"
976,Well yes I do. I'm a carpenter for a living.
976,that's awesome. do you love what you do?
976,I enjoy rock climbing in more dangerous sitez. With my husband
976,thats's interesting. I would love to try it sometime. 
976,"Yea and kinda connected to the brain waves stuff, my husband doea telecom work and kinda visualisi"
976,wow. my wife is adventurous. She will love to  join me as well.
976,That's great! I enjoy spending time out doors with the hub.
977,Since I got accepted I really want to quit my job and find a new one. But the school fees are not going to pay themselves
977,"Indeed, if i could have it my way I would enjoy the warm weather and go for a stroll while reading a nice book for the rest of my life!"
977,Do you work? Because my Boss is so strict
977,"I do not work right not, just collecting my retirement living on a lake! Really? What does your boss do?"
977,He always cuts my breaks short and gives me twice as much work
977,That is aggravating. You should tell him that you need to get a higher pay for your work!
977,"I'm pretty sure he would just reject me. Last time I asked for somethin, I nearly lost my temper with the way he was treating me"
977,"Try to just keep pushing because after all, you need the money for medical school."
977,I probably should look for another job if i cant secure better pay
977,"That is very true as well. If you can put in the work, you can achieve anything."
977,I sure hope I do
977,I believe you will too!
978,Blue is my favorite color. It's calming. 
978,I believe it is. I painted my daughters room blue because of it
978,My sons room was in yellow because we didn't know what he was going to be before he was born. I wish I had know now. 
978,"I see,  Did you have different colors in your room as a kid?"
978,My room as a kid was mostly green and had a Woodsy Owl theme. What about you?
978,"awesome. I have short pink hair, I guess Ill dye my hair blue soon lol"
978,"I wish I had the guts to have short pink hair. Right now, I'm just trying to hide the gray! You are brave."
978,"thank you for saying that , i'm sure deep down you are brave too. That's a fact :) smile :)"
978,"I'm smiling. I'm brave in other ways, guess. My  job would't let me have pink hair anyway. What do you do?"
978,I work from home so I guess that;'s a plus. Im a data developer
978,"Nice. I'm a restuarant manager, learning how to be a transcriptionist so I can work from home. "
978,oh wow that's so cool . certainly job security in this age . way to go!!!
979,"various reasons, mentally i wasnt in a good place. i'm better now thankfully but not sure what to do!"
979,Wow with a kid involved that's a big no no! I'm sorry you're going through this
979,"that's ok, i have to face up to the responsibility now. i'll bet your life isn't as complicated lol"
979,"Well, yes and no. There's ups and downs, but you get used to the responsibilities. Just expect more stress from your wife than anything else."
979,"i think she'll understand, i hope so anyway. she was there for me when i was really low."
979,I am sure she will. Have you experienced a situation like that before?
979,no thankfully! have you?
979,No I have not. I have had a stable relationship
979,good for you. so what do you do with your spare time?
979,I mainly play video games and workout
980,I spend too much time away from home.
980,Accepting that your shortcomings as a father is the first step forward. You should spend time with your kids
980,"Well, I am too busy at work"
980,Try managing your time better. Relaxing and spending time with your family can improve your productivity at work
980,I know I work on a cruise ship and I only get 2 months off 
980,what do you do in those 2 months that you get?
980,I spend time with my parents.
980,and what about your kids? do you get them along to meet their grandparents?
980,"sometimes, but me and my wife are in a divorce."
980,You should try and reason with your wife why those two months is the only time you get to spend with your kids
980,she only lets me see them one week out of the too months.
980,Wow that's really frustrating.

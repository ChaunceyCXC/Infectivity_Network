1,that is ok.  have any kids?
1,"No, but someday."
1,that is good. I have 2
1,After I am done with school I plan to have a family.
1,that is great! you will be ready
1,"I hope so, how old are your kids?"
1,5 & 7.  they take up a lot of my time
1,I would imagine. I am sure they a great kids.
1,"luckily, they love flowers just as much as I do.  we spend a lot of time in the garden"
1,I wish I had more time to do stuff like that. Medical school is exhausting. 
1,"sounds like it. have you gotten any acting jobs, though?"
2,Oh really!? That is interesting. I am actually italian myself.
2,Awesome. Me and my partner just bought a house. I can't wait to cook in my kitchen.
2,Moving in a new place can be a lot of fun. Are you a good cook?
2,I like to think so. I love to make coffee for an after dinner treat too.
2,Mmm That sounds delicious right now.
2,What do you like to do?
2,"Well I like tattoos and piercings, I am working on my next one right now."
2,piercings are cool . i do not have any tattoos though. Too scared. I want some
2,What would you get?
2,Maybe something for my kids. I've always wanted an anarchy symbol.
2,Haha that is a cool idea.
2,I like to think I'm cool too. Hopefully one day.
3,It's a little dog. Why is it the little ones always bark the most?
3,I believe it is due to their behavior and internal and external stimuli.
3,I'd like to introduce that dog to my pet snakes. I think they'd eat him though!
3,Oh no! But I think black snakes are good? They eat nasty bugs and rodents!
3,My snakes are both pythons. I feed them mice. Do you have any pets?
3,"No, but I would love to have a cat for it to hunt mice in my house lol"
3,You have mice running around your house? Yikes! I think I'd rather have the barking dogs than that.
3,"Lol, but they do make great companions at times.I give them bread and they leave me alone for the most part. "
3,"Have you given them names? If not, maybe we can come up with some."
3,"i just called them all Jerry, Big Jerry, Always hungry Jerry and then there's the Tiny Jerry. "
3,Now you really do need to get a cat and call him Tom.
3,Yep that would completely the collection! I am widow so I need all the companions I can get haha
4,yes i do because i do not have a car
4,if you could have a car what would it be?
4,a honda because they are affordable and reliable
4,i love the oscar mier wiener-mobile. it reminds me of snacking when i'm not having a meal. would you drive the oscar meir weiner mobile?
4,"i do not think so, what about you?"
4,"i lost my driver's liscense, ufortunately, but i would if i could"
4,how did you lose it?
4,"i did some bad stuff, but that's not important"
4,im saving up to buy a new camera to take pictures of people who lost their licenses actually
4,do you take pictures of people with curly hair like mine?
4,"no, only people with long hair like mine"
4,"well, you got to do you, brother. i'm proud of you anyway!"
5,"Yes, thank you. I think I just need some time to make it pass."
5,"Should always be drinking water anyways, your body needs it!"
5,"Yes it does, especially during summer."
5,What do you do for a living?  I try my best in sales.
5,I work at a ski resort. I love it!
5,"I heard Mount Tom Ski Area in Holyoke, Mass is a great resort to visit"
5,I have never been but I have heard the same. I love snow and the mountains.
5,"I wish I could enjoy the snow and mountains, I would be afraid I could not answer my cellphone!"
5,"Haha, these days it is amazing where you can get cell service."
5,i agree ! that is the main reason I have a phone !
5,Do you have any plans this weekend?
5,"No plans yet, I'm just happy to sleep in for once!"
6,"Yea, but to be perfectly honest, I actually don't work hard either."
6,oh i see . i am really reliable in my job on other things i am not
6,Well my problem is that I just never had to really work. I always had money. What things are you not reliable in?
6,Mostly jobs and children.
6,What do you mean children?
6,"They are food, shelter, child care, health care, transportation, and utilities."
6,"Ok, Im pretty confused as to what you mean, but that sounds like a lot."
6,it is a lot to take care of because kids are a lot of responsibility
6,"I see. Well good luck with that, I wouldn't know because I don't have kids yet."
6,oh well thank you . what else should i know about you ?
6,"Well, Im going through some drama right now with my sister in law, she hates me. "
6,Family conflict is always hard.  Maybe you should be the bigger man and work for peace 
7,"yeah, i think i will!"
7,I love my job as a teacher but would also like to assk for a raise
7,"who do you ask? aren't teacher salaries decided by some sort of... thing, or whatever? i love my family."
7,I would ask the school board they base it on how long you've been there and test scores
7,how would the principal feel about you going behind his back?
7,"Not sure, I suppose I could sit down and discuss it with him. What kind of work do you do?"
7,"i'm a garbage man, although i'm a woman. my boss drives the truck, but i'm more qualified, really."
7,"I've never driven a truck, only small vehicles! How's that working out for you? My two dogs would love to ride along if I did that"
7,dogs would for sure love a big truck full of garbage. i thik i'm the top 20 or so best garbage men in the area
7,oh wow that is impressive . must be an extremely difficult job .
7,"no.literally anyone could do it. you just pick up garbage. it's not as easy as teaching, im sure, buts ittakes no skill"
7,If you have patience teaching is great but they test your nerves every day
8,"The vehicle was exactly what I wanted, a newer model sports car."
8,"That was a good choice, What kind of car was it?"
8,"A Mustang GT, convertible"
8,Nice! Too bad you couldn't get  your hands on a 1963 Mustang II. That's my favorite car.
8,A few years ago I helped with a restoration on a 67. It was absolutely gorgeous.
8,That sounds awesome. Did you restore it with your dad?
9,Tap is pretty odd compared to the others. My daughter loves ballet.
9,"i love broadway shows , so this was the closest thing i had ."
9,"Yea, well keep it up, maybe one day you'll be on broadway."
9,"i hope so. i'm so bad at math. they count 5,6,7,8! at the beginning, and i wish they would stick to smaller numbers"
9,"hahah that's funny. I believe in you though, you can overcome that. "
9,it's like a chorus line. the musical with actor michael douglass. have you seen it/
9,"No I haven't, I don't watch movies very often. Im usually out at clubs people watching."
9,"when do you think you'll get a chance to catch up on some film? I love dancing, but when I'm not treading the boards, I love watching tv"
9,Probably not for a while. I just bought a new jaguar and I try to get out and just drive around and show it off as much as possible. 
9,"wow, i love animals. What does it eat?"
9,Haha the car not the animal. A jaguar would eat me as I tried to feed it for sure.
9,do you hink people like looking at you r car? I heard they are hard to maintain
10,You worked for a circus? Tell me you juggled while riding a unicycle and had a monkey on your shoulder.
10,"No, I couldn't do that."
10,"Me neither, but that might be because I like to drink...a lot. "
10,I drink a lot too because I am a reality tv star and it is stressful
10,Are you famous? I'm kind of famous in my own town.
10,"yes, i am famous. what type of music do you listen to? "
10,"My favorite singer is Meatloaf, are you a fan of his?"
10,"never heard of him, i only listen to country music honestly "
10,"Not only is Meatloaf a great singer, but it's also a delicious food. Can't beat that combo."
10,Food is the gateway to the soul.
10,And meatloaf is the express train to my heart. Nothing like a little hamburg and spices to get things going.
10,that sounds delicious 
10,Have a good one!
11,I think I am going to get a new camera.
11,what happened to your old one?
11,Nothing but I want an upgrade.
11,why can't you just use the one on your phone?
11,I am trying to do professional photography.
11,"Wow. I love writing fiction creatively, and that would make a great story. What sort of phone did you start out with?"
11,You know just a flip phone haha. Are you working on a book right now?
11,"It's about these pills that reveal the world is full of dinosaurs, but you can't ee them without the pills, so you don't know where they are"
11,Oh! Interesting! That would be scary.
11,"it's a drama, actually, and the dinosaurs don;t bother anyone. would you ever take a picture of something like that?"
11,Of course! That would make my career!
11,oh cool. what sort of shutter speed would u set it on?
12,It was. I don't know why I didn't just stop doing it.
12,Probably a good idea . Now i'm not sure what to say . An awkward ordeal.
12,Neither am I. I'm not even sure why I brought up such a thing in a random conversation. 
12,Try not to let it get to you.  Life is weird. Things happen and then you move on.
12,"Amen to that. Anyway, do you like to read?"
12,"I do like reading. Lately I've been reading about Lightning McQueen. Do you like the movie ""Cars""?"
12,Is that the animated movie?
12,Yeah they have made a few of them. I like them so much I named my cat mater after the tow truck in the film.
12,Oh thats really cool. Yea I love those movies a lot! Whats your favorite food?
12,"I love chicken, and Chinese food. Well, just about any food actually. How about you?"
12,"I love pizza, its definitely my favorite of all time. Chinese is great too though. Have you had chinese pizza before?"
12,Yes! The Chinese restaurant down the street has it. It's pretty good.
13,"that is okay, everyone is different"
13,yeah I'm pretty different if you get what I mean
13,"no i do not get what you mean, care to elaborate? "
13,well we have  sub personality that tends to control or feelings
13,i think the crystals i dabble with can change your sub personality 
13,oh wow I hear that stuff is bad for you
13,im addicted to the power of them
13,I really can't stop eating sweets myself
13,you will stop when you get diabetes
13,"Yeah I was told the same thing, but I'm addicted. unlucky"
13,meditation will dissolve all addictions 
13,I will try medicine first 
14,I do. I love watching football with my dog. Do you have any pets?
14,"i have a cat, what do you do as a job?"
14,"I'm a student, which is great for now. Gives me time to hang out with my friends. What do you do?"
14,im currently working at a candy store
14,That sounds awesome!
14,did you ever play sports in school?
14,Nah. Never had the discipline. I'd always rather be with my friends.
14,i played football and basketball in college and i wouldnt trade that experience for the world 
14,What did you study in college?
14,"Criminology, what about you?"
14,"Currently political science, but I'm thinking about switching."
14,what are you thinking of switching to?
15,"Yea, I have a really bad feeling that its going to crash or something. "
15,"oh. my god. i never fiinished college, so i'm willing to listen to you explain your psychic visions to me"
15,"Ok well, I had a vision last night that aliens would attack my plane and we would crash."
15,we're on the same plane? what country are these illegals from? like hijackers?
15,"No why would you be on my flight a couple weeks from now? They are from another planet, most likely Jupiter."
15,sounds like i'd be better off just cancelling our trip and going back to finish my degree. what do you think?
15,Would you? I think that is for the best. It's safer.
15,"do you have to take off your shoes at airports still? I know like in japan you probably do, but is it everywhere?"
15,"I think so, what Im not sure about though is if they every give them back to you. I think they might just mail them to you"
15,"yeah, there's a fed ex in there for that. Where are you going on your trip?"
15,I am going to Japan actually but then Im flying right back. I'm really just going for the flying experience.
15,Smart. You don't want your airline miles to expire. Are you getting a meal? Maybe a hot towl?
16,"No, I am worried about the calorie intake, haha."
16,"no , i love a challenge . i want to eat it all ."
16,I can agree with that. Have you heard the news recently?
16,No. I have not turned on the tv
16,There is new footage of an alien ship plying over the ocean.
16,wow that would be exciting and scary .
16,I always knew they watched over us.
16,Something like the Aliens in the film franchise?
16,Yes it is shocking to watch.
16,yea i have seen some interesting things .
16,Tell me! I am always interested in UFO stories.
16,Aliens came out 1986.
17,"I have two dogs. One named Bruno and the other named Mars, because I like Bruno Mars, lol."
17,That's cute. I love the cute name. I miss my dog.
17,"Aww, I'm sorry about your dog. What was your dog's name?"
17,"Her name was frost, after robert frost"
17,"That's awesome! I love Robert Frost's books. You must like to read, yes?"
17,"i do , I am an aspiring poet."
17,Great to hear. I hope to read your works someday! have you been published in anything yet?
17,"Yes a few things, they are doing well. "
17,"That's good. I used to write some things when I was in school, but nothing serious. Always dreamed of getting a book published, though."
17,I am sure if you kept at it you would be very successful.
17,Maybe one day I'll start again. I work too much right now and don't have a whole lot of time to devote to it.
17,I'm sure you will one day! What do you do?
18,I like country too!
18,country is quite popular in the southern part of the united states
18,I was raised on a farm myself
18,i use to swim in the lake behind my uncle's farm and had the time of my life
18,Sounds like good memories
18,"yes , i sure do remember those days and how much fun we all had ! !"
18,My hair was so red back then 
18,is red your favorite color?
18,its alright as long it is bright red
18,i think my favorite color is orange because it can turn into any shade of red or range i find
18,I like the color of yellow reminds me of corn on the farm
18,is corn one of your favorite foods?
19,What kind of positives do you get out of that?
19,We don't have a lot of photos together. We all have the same curly brown hair.
19,That's pretty neat. It must be hard to take care of curly hair. 
19,Its a long process but I love it
19,I have had a dog that had curly hair. It was a mixed poodle and it was red. Really active animal she was. 
19,My aunt had a poodle greyhound mix. She was gorgeous
19,That mix of dog breeds sounds cool. Was she tall like the greyhound or short like the poodle? You get all kinds of unique traits 
19,Tall and pretty grey coat
19,Beautiful type of dog. We had one growing up as a kid. Hard to keep him contained
19,I loved that dog and I'm a cat person.
19,I feel you. Cats are sometimes easier to have around. We have four of them now haha. 
19,Cool. We are going to adopt when we move soon.
20,I love reading the bible right before bed
20,That sounds soothing. There are some amazing lessons in that book.
20,i work as a school teacher how about you?
20,"I am trying to become a baker, i just love baking."
20,Baking is so much fun
20,"Yes it is! Plus it usually works with my vegetarian diet, haha."
20,thats a good diet to be on.  What is your favorite vegetarian meal>?
20,"Any kind of pasta, it's my weakness."
20,I love pasta
20,I do too.  I have a fantastic recipe with alfredo sauce.
20,alfredo is the best do you make it from scratch?
20,"Yes, everything from scratch. It is an old recipe."
21,"Me too, serial killers are dark but fascinating people."
21,You seem to know a lot about serial killers!
21,"Well, I think it's important to learn about human nature in all forms, don't you? It's how we evolve."
21,"Absolutely, although I find them too scary. I prefer to stick to collecting stamps."
21,"Haha yea, I understand that. I am actually a writer so I have to do a lot of research on such things unfortunately "
21,"Ah, yes, the lucrative writing career. (Just kidding), What types of stuff do you write?"
21,"Haha well, passion is passion, money or not. I write horror and mystery novels mostly. Do you enjoy reading?"
21,"i do , i love to read dean koontz. He's my favorite."
21,"Yes I love koontz as well, He was a big inspiration for me growing up"
21,That's very cool. What other authors inspired you?
21,"Stephen King, etc. Mostly horror authors. Do you have any hobbies?"
21,"Other than collecting stamps, I play a lot of tennis. How about you?"
22,It hurts badly so I am afraid I may have to see a doctor.
22,"Yeah, maybe you should just put some ice on it? It's supposed to be ice on and off for 10 min intervels.We learned that in self defense class."
22,"Oh that is a good idea, I will be taking your advice. but what if that does not work?"
22,"Could look into doctors in your area that take self pay, some help with making payments and some have programs for uninsured."
22,In today's world no one will take pity on me. The pain is excruciating. I think I need pain killers too
22,"Seriously, I'm also uninsured, wanted to move to Vegas but the rates there for healthcare were worse than my place, I'm sorry "
22,I am so sorry to hear that you are in the same boat as me. We really need insurance.
22,"Would be nice for sure, but not too much we can do I guess, besides the injury anything good happen recently?"
22,"Well My mate proposed to me yesterday, I am so happy"
22,Oh wow that's awesome to hear! A big congrats to the both of you!
22,Thanks a lot. we would like to have five children.
22,"Wow, five now that's going to be a fun family, my wife and I are thinking of adopting ourselves."
23,It sounds like good exercise
23,"It is. I have gotten in much better shape since I started. Counteracts all of the video games I play, lol. Do you like video games?"
23,"Yes, i play a lot. Probably too much."
23,"As long as you get up every now and then to stretch you're alright, lol. I love racing games the most."
23,I like RPG. Something to make me feel less lonely.
23,I like those games too! Sometimes I like to just go off and pretend I am someone else and have fun in those games.
23,Exactly! The games today are amazing!
23,"They really are. It's amazing how far the games have come since back in the day. i still like classic games, too."
23,"Same here, sometimes I play mario kart."
23,Mario Kart was a great game! I was so good at dropping those bananas! Nintendo has become one of the most influential video game companies in the industry!
23,It really has. The CEO seems like a good person.
23,"Yeah, they really seem to care about the games they put out."
24,"that is more than enough size for a hole, i should pay that course a visit"
24,"oh, you simply must. It gets so lonely here, for me, in my isolated cabin."
24,do you work?
24,I'mnot sure. Maybe? I fish. I fish in the lake. Do you know it?
24,no i do not have much time to fish at lakes because i am busy at the large law firm i work at
24,I love law. I had jury duty once and the law seemed so official. I'm jealous.
24,what are you jealous of?
24,"how you must interract with people. All the cool rules and the way you can approach the bench. law clerks, stenographers, it rules."
24,you should try to get a job in law then
24,"If there was any law and order around the isolated cabin and the lake where I fish, I would get into it."
24,ahh it sounds like you are really attached to your cabin 
24,Confined you might say. And the lake. I can never leave. I love the fishing. 
25,But seeds have been found in Germany from 3000 BC
25,Wow that really old. Maybe if my dad had eaten a lot of carrots like me he wouldn't have had a heart attack
26,Wow. that's a lot. I do believe in love though.
26,Yea I've been burned too many times. Have you been in love?
26,I have. Sometimes it doesn't work but you have to keep trying
26,I guess so. It just seems like so much pain to end up with nothing.
26,I had to move into a storage locker after a break up.
26,"Wow, thats rough. why?"
26,It was his apartment and I moved out of town with him. My boyfriend now is great
26,"Damn, he made you sleep in a locker though wow? Im glad to hear things are better now. how long have you been together?"
26,I didn't sleep there lol. All of my things were there. I slept in a motel some nights
26,Lol oh ok. Thats good to know.
26,Keep trying. A good relationship will make you forget about all of the bad ones
26,That's the truth.
27,I really love to baje 
27,my cousin and my aunt are both teachers and they love it
27,Have you been to Mexico before? 
27,"No I have not, have you?"
27,I was born there!
27,"Oh nice, I have never been to Mexico, I am just here in my studio apartment!"
27,Do you like cake?
27,Yes.. I like cake..One of my favorite cakes is butter cake
27,I love lemon cake!
27,"I don't like lemon desserts that much, but that sounds actually good to be honest."
27,And tacos I love tacos 
27,Those are really good. I am more of a burrito man myself.
28,"Whatever, I'm happy with just me and my two dogs. "
28,I wish you luck.  You have to meet the right one some day!
28,"Maybe, are you married?"
28,I am not. I would love to someday
28,"You could be like me and just hang out with your dogs. They have stinky breath, but other than that, they're pretty great."
28,"Sure, I am taking my time. I have blue shoes"
28,They sound very fancy. I don't think I've ever owned a pair of blue shoes.
28,They are nice. I like the color blue very much.
28,I used to live in a blue house. But it got destroyed by a tornado.
28,oh no . i'm sorry to hear that . that is sad
28,"Yeah, I'm going to use the insurance money to take a trip around the world."
28,"Wow, happy for you. I hope you get to enjoy your trip."
29,I just cannot eat their food for some reason
29,Yea all of that processed food is bad for you.
29,It is not healthy at all. Do you have any idea what I could use to clean my glasses? They are always dirty
29,"Yea sure, use some windex or something."
29,I did not know windex could be used on glasses
29,"Oh yea, it does a heck of a job."
29,"I am so glad that you told me because I do have windex, I just don't like the smell"
29,Yea it has a strong chemical smell to it. 
29,I don't think that would be the best to use for cleaning my glasses
29,"Probably not the best, but it was all I could think of."
29,I thank you for the advice though
29,"No problem, I always enjoy helping others."
30,"Nice, we have a lot in common. I love rap music and fast cars."
30,I'm only 18 so you know I love both those things
30,Hell yea. What else are you into?
30,I just got into healthy eating and exercising
30,"Nioce, what kind of stuff do you eat now?"
30,salads i try to stay in shape and listen to music most the day. I drink a lot of water too
30,What kind of training do you do? weights?
30,I'm saving moeny to get a car so I don't have a gym membership. just running push ups etc
30,"Sweet, calisthenics stuff. That's all you really need. Good for you. How long you been at it?"
30,6 months. not long I guess. I feel great though
30,"6 months is definitely long enough to get some great results. Keep it up, you're already way passed where most people give up."
30,i'll totally try to keep on it. I'm determined
31,"oh, what street? Is it neer the circus where I preform. Sorry to bring it up, but I'm so ecited. It's my first day. What street, though/"
31,"yes , it is . on fourth street ."
31,"That's near third and fifth, right? I would NOT take that job if I were you."
31,"Yeah, right in between. I think it's a better job than taking over my dad's appliance store, I don't want that business at all."
31,Does your dad like the movies?I try to go when I can. What's his favorie?
31,"He's a big fan of buddy cop movies, and old war films. What movies do you like?"
31,Oh war for sure. I love wars. They're so cinematic!
31,"I like war movies . Saving Private Ryan was great . I like Full Metal Jacket, too."
31,"Uh, that sounds like a pretty heavy garmnet if you ask me!!!"
31,"Yeah, I guess. I just try not to say the wrong things. it's why I don't like social situations."
31,"Yes, you're doing great, though. How was the interview process?"
31,It could have gone better. I think I missed some the answers they asked. I was nervous.
32,It takes time to learn that I why I read so much
32,you are full of energy. I love it. What do you learn?
32,Well I read a lot about bands and music history
32,You know anything about fish? Beta fish?
32,no but my band fine frenzy sings about them
32,Please give me a few lyrics from your beta fish song. I need to know.
32,swim swim swim little fish to the sea don't look back
32,That's very evocative. You have the soul of a poet. What key is it in?
32,"monotone, but its based on this book I read growing up"
32,What book is that?
32,it was a charles dickens book about a giant whale
32,I try to donate my old stuff to poors so they don't look like Dickensian urchins. You can compliment me if you like.
33,"I only have one sister, so I didn't grow up watching much sports."
33,That is too bad! I can't get enough of soccer.
33,Do you play soccer a lot?
33,"yes , soccer i am very good . I have a good team."
33,I wish I could join a soccer team. I'm to busy filling prescriptions all the time.
33,You are doing a great service to people. Thank you!
33,"Soccer players provide my sister and I with plenty of entertainment, so thank you too!"
33,"Haha, no problem. How old is your sister?"
33,"She was ten when I started medical school, so that would make her sixteen now."
33,Oh that's a fun age. I am sure she is happy to have a big sister.
33,"Yes, being in the pharmaceutical industry pays well, so I'm able to take her out from time to time."
33,I am sure it does. Do you ever go to soccer matches?
34,I don't watch a lot of tv but do watch some. I prefer listening to music. 
34,Tv can be more fun than music
34,"sometimes, yes. My dog and cat are also fun to watch. My dog is smaller than my cat lol"
34,my cat is larger than my dog but I have a tiny dog
34,my dog is a Chihuahua they're usually not very big anyway 
34,They can be feisty 
34,"Oh yes, she certainly is! Always acting like a big bad dog"
34,I cope by reading with my cat
34,That's a good way to cope. Get away and pet your cat. Thats extra relaxing 
34,yes you are right it is my cat likes it too
34,my cat won't stay still long enough for me to read to him
34,My gf broke up with me so I am sad 
35,Do you like court movies? I want to work in federal court someday.
35,I sure do! A movie that revolves around a crime and solving it is so suspenseful. I wanted to be a lawyer when I was younger.
35,I was a lawyer once. I can't get enough of movies and show like that. 
35,"Wow that's awesome! I just ended up selling my arts and crafts at the flea market, I need to go back to school I guess lol."
35,What kind of stuff do you make?
35,"I do some woodworking, like carvings and plaques. I also do seasonal cut outs."
35,Wow. That's sounds cool
35,"It's fun, keeps me out of trouble. Wish I had more time to work on them though."
35,What do you do for actual work then?
35,I am a clerk in an accounting firm.
35,Probably boring.
35,At times. it pays good though.
36,Losing my job forced me to live with my parents temporarily
36,Oh man I'm sorry. But hopefully you get to save up on rent money? When I was diagnosed as a diabetic I had to move in with them too.
36,"That is too bad, yes this has gotten me depressed a lot for sure."
36,Man I'm so sorry. My mom works for Apple maybe I can ask if she knows of any way to get a job there for you.
36,That would be nice thanks a lot for the thought!
36,"Yeah of course I'll ask her in a bit, she's a manager I think so she should be able to pull some strings."
36,What do you do for a living?
36,Currently I stay at home trying to get my meds under control then hopefully maybe go back to school?
36,"Nice, well I wish you the best of luck as well, going back to school would be a smart idea!"
36,Yeah I think I might get into computer repair. Is there anything you'd like to do with your time while you wait for jobs openings?
36,I think I will stay busy and work on some home improvments on my parent's house.  I'll just be cheap labor.
36,That's super nice of you I'm sure they'll appreciate it
37,Oh no I reported it to the police but so far they have not found the person who did it
37,sounds like you need to take matters into your own hands. The police can't help you. Not when real justice is required.
37,I honestly don't know how to go about doing it.
37, Close your eyes and let your fantasies guide you. You know what you want deep down inside
37,"Well, even though I am a jack of all trades I do need some tires. I am so upset"
37,"I thik you're a great person, but you need to stand up for yourself. I have a small dog. It helps me."
37,"That's so nice, maybe I need to get a dog"
37,you can use mine. They have an innate sense for the evils lurking within a person.
37,"Oh dear, you are so sweet. Thank you very much"
37,"Sure. I'm having second thoughts. Ypu don't live in a bad neighborhoos do you? My bike is my life, but my dog id all right as well."
37,Oh no I live in a nice neighborhood.
37,"Do you ever air b&b? Would you accept dogs? you know, if you did? Just dogs?"
38,"I named my cat as Nancy, she like to be around when I'm in library"
38,Thats a cool name I like it a lot
38,"how about you, do you also like reading?"
38,I do read occasionally but not eat 
38,I have lots of used books as those are cheaper you know!

38,I like to eat a lot when reading
39,"I want to own my own company someday, so I think it would help to know about them"
39,What is the name of the company?
39,"Well, I don't have one yet, but it will be a programming company"
39,Oh! Well it involves several fields of electrical engineering and computer science to develop software.
39,Sounds like I will have to hire some smart people.
39,"Everyone needs an IT guy, so probably best to get good developers."
39,How much does it cost to pay for an IT guy?
39,it depends on the specific technologies you are looking for. somewhere between $55-70 an hour is standard.
39,"Oh wow, that's a lot. Maybe I can get a new grad that is cheaper."
39,this depends on the level of experience that your project requires. also the maturity level you are seeking in an employee. 
39,That's true. This is more complicated than I was expecting.
39,"Well, hopefully when it's all said and done it'll be be worth it. Best of luck with it."
40,They are my favorite band
40,"Yes. I love their music. I saw them in concert a while back. i had to sit close to the stage because I am so short, lol It was fun."
40,I haven't been to a concert in forever
40,"I haven't either, I can hardly find the time. "
40,I spend most of my time at the gym
40,Oh yeah. I usually work out at home. it's cheaper for me. Do you prefer any particular exercises? 
40,I do a lot of cardio. Havemy own bike.
40,"That's good exercise . I try to at least get out and walk around the block once a day, now that I have my contact lenses."
40,I could never keep up with glasses. I have contacts too
40,"Yeah, I'm near sighted and I got so tired of putting my big sunglasses on over my prescriptions. Much better now."
40,Good for you
40,Thanks. Did you wear glasses before you got contacts?

42,That's nice. I should do that. We talk a lot
42,thats good that should help
42,I think I need a vacation
43,I wish I had the sort of creativity to join it but I don't 
43,You certainly could focus on drawing I think
43,Yea I try to sell them online but no one wants to buy them haha 
43,You can launch your art career full time
43,Out of my apartment? Its gonna take a lot of work. I dont know...

43,"Nice, what else do you like to do for fun?"

45,He'll be fine and maybe he'll be famous one day.
45,I will still wimp out. i want to be famous like the rolling stones  though.
45,I'm more of a nirvana type of guy.
45,I loved Nirvana and Soundgarden in college.
45,You should do karaoke at the restaurant I work at.
45,"i do not work . between school work and hockey , i have no time ."
45,That's too bad because we have some good nirvana songs available on the karaoke machine. The locals love it.
45,I loved his song Starfish & Coffee when I was little.
45,I think you're confusing prince with nirvana.
45,No haha but I do remember that song as well! I think it was something about an opera singer.
45,I love that song about teenage spirit.

49,"Probably pretty cool? Get to float and stuff, but I hear using the bathroom is a pain."
49,Regular life is boring 
49,I'll agree to that. Anything else you like doing?

50,i would have to say french was the hardest one
50,How did you learn it? At a school?
50,Yeah i took a four year course on each language

51,You should. It's awesom
51,I'm giving it some serious thought. There will be another show like it.
51,I hope so !
51,Exactly these new shows can try but the cast and special effects are going to be harp to top. I drew a lot of inspiration from the show.
51,same here that show does good for people
51,and artists alike
51,yes they do i agree
52,That's good especially when we can play outside in summer.
52,i love football and being outside
52,Its easy to dress in summer thats why I like summer to wear easy clothes
52,Yeah I like to walk around with no shirt on. Makes me feel manly.
52,"I don't like much of dressing, what else you like to do?"
52,"I like other sports, too. Like baseball. You?"
52,I like soccer and long tennis and cooking at home.
52,Really? What sort of cooking do you like to do?
52,baking most and BBQ in sunshine is lots of fun
52,I love cooking outside in summer.
52,you know its easy open clothes in front of BBQ with cooking smell.
52,That doesn't make sense. But that's OK. BBQ rules.
53,That is pretty to take in all once can you explain
53,"People all act the same way, some people just think their actions are more meaningful"
53,"Interesting, but some actions are more meaningful, like I am a vegan"
53,Why did you become vegan?
53,mainly because I wanted to change the world and save animals
53,How do you think that will change the world?
53,Because I looked in a cows eyes and they were the same color brown as my own
53,Do you think cows have feelings?
53,Well it felt like I was looking into the mirror of my own soul and emotions
53,That's sad. Do you think the cow feels the same about being vegan?
53,That is why they mainly eat grass and things because they are just like me
53,I think they just eat grass because they're too slow to catch an animal
54,I also love to read 
54,"I do also paint in my free time,"
54,How old are you 
54,"I'm gonna be 23 this year and living in Vienna, Austria"
54,I am very old
55,Not yet. What do you think I should buy with it?
55,I think you should try to find the owner and give it back
55,How do I know I'm not the owner? Maybe I dropped it yesterday?
55,"Well, if that's the case that's cool. Did you lose $20 yesterday?"
55,No. Wow. There goes that theory. Who do you think dropped it?
55,I think it was me. Can you bring it to me?
55,That depends. Do you like hockey?
55,Which answer will get the $20?
55,"Hey, I think you're just trying to tell me what I want to hear. You're not tricking me, are you?"
55,"Definitely not, I just want my $20 back."
55,"And what were you doing outside my house? I'm 6 feet tall, you know. I can be pretty scary."
55,"Well, I'm 6 foot 1, so I'm not scared of anyone"
56,well it scratched my car
56,Oh no. did you get their license plate?
56,"no thats why I am scared, especially bcause I leased the car"
56,Did you let the loan holder know what happened?
56,no Im afraid they will charge me a bunch of money
56,"that sounds tough, i'm sorry."
56,I feel like all I will be able to afford is potatoes if they try and take my money
56,do you have insurance at least?
56,nope I'm bad I can barely afford the lease
56,wow. maybe you need some legal aide :/
56,Ah well I will just go into hiding with my potatoes I love them
56,haha better bring a pot with you and some flint to start a fire
57,What do you like to eat in general?
57,"Anything and everything. No lie, but my I do try to eat healthy for the most part."
57,"I try to eat healthy as well, I don't like meat"
57,"I don't usually eat meat, except chicken occasionally. It makes me feel bad eating it though."
57,I have worked at a movie theater for many years
57,I wish I could afford to go to the movies. My mom spends all of our money on shoes for herself.
57,Wow I could take you with me
57,That is so nice of you. I've thought about selling my one and only pair of shoes for a movie ticket.
57,"I would love to give you a Free ticket, so you would not have to sell your shoes."
57,thank you ! i'd greatly appreciate it. You are the nicest person I've ever met.

68,That's nice do you like to watch animated comedy cartoons?
68,Yes I do 
68,Have you ever tried South Park? My friend tells me much about that
68,Yes it's funny but rude 
68,"Yeah I think sometime jokes can go too far, there should be some limit"
68,Do you have a cold 
68,No its nice weather here no chances of cold so far
68,I can cure the common cold 
68,Seriously if you have a formula you can win a Noble prize for that you know
69,I find most of the dishes are too spicy for me
69,Is it weird that i like the dishes mainly because they are spicy?
69,Not at all. Despite how spicy they are some of the dishes are actually good. 
69,"You are right. I have established that you do not do ''spicy'', so then what is your favorite dish, i want to believe you have one."
69,Although it is not Indian cuisine I am a big fan of chicken alfredo
70,well I'm too chubby for role playing you know
70,chubby is a funny word . do you have any hobbies ?
70,Well I love to do camping and have lamp in dark nights 
70,Cool. I've never been camping. I enjoy going for long walks. It's so relaxing to me.
70,And lots and lots of food that makes you chubby like me LOL
70,Food solves lots of things lol. I recently got a new pet cat. That helps a little with my emotional eating.
70,Wow a cat what you named her?
70,Her name is Smoky!  My husband got it for me. It was sweet!
70,It was sweet? what do you mean has she gone somewhere?
70,"No, I meant it was sweet that he got the kitten for me."
70,cool that is nice what color
70,It is grey and white striped. That's why we picked her name. Suits her well.
71,I've got super curly hair. More like rigatoni than spaghetti.
71,ohh don't remind me too much of food
71,"I'm Greek, I can't help it. All we talk about is food!"
71,"I hate cooking so much, I wouldn't make it ever"
71,"So you don't like to cook. That's not important. But, do you like to eat?"
71,yeah me and my mom eat dinner every night
71,What's your absolute favorite thing to have?
71,A nice seafood gumbo
71,"Oooh, that sounds delicious. Does your Mom cook that?"
71,"Yeah, she lives with me, cheaper than putting her in a nursing home"
71,"Yeah, I just dropped mine off at a fire station. Someday I should check in and see what happened to her."
71,Oh no that probably will not end well
72,perhaps if you had the chance you would have enjoyed his company
72,"yeah, but he went through with it anyways despite my plead"
72,sometimes people cannot really stay together despite the desire to care for children
72,that's very true.but mom turn out to be very fine after the whole drama
73,that's a good habit. i'm just lazy i think
73,"I wish I could be to be honest but my mom's a teacher and she's kinda one of those ""If I can do it you can do it"" kinda exhausting"
73,My mom used to be like that. Now she's just as bad as me hehe
73,"Haha that's great, hopefully my mom get's there but I guess it's the best for my kid so i can't be too upset, even if I wanna be :P"
73,"Yeah I feel you there. I've been losing a lot of weight and I could prob do better cooking. No kid to make me want to do good, though :P"
73,"Man I miss those days hehe, but that's awesome on losing weight awesome job! I started trying to work out more....tryyying"
73,I need to also :( it's been all eating less but I'm afraid that won't be enough soon
73,I'm sure you'll find something to keep it all evened out. There's a lot of simple stuff out there to start off like just walking more.
73,Yeah I got some headphones just yesterday to use while walking
73,"Oh man I love music while walking. Something just makes it better, whether it's upbeat or calming music."
73,Yeah for sure. I put on 90s rock and pretend it's 1996
73,Oooohhhh yeah now that's how to do it!
74,I like to discuss politics when on long routes of driving
74,I'm almost indifferent to politics at this point. People get so upset when you disagree with them. 
74,Well I talk about politics sometime at my radio station as well
74,"Sometimes my family gets into politics a lot, but fortunately it rarely turns hostile."
74,Well my friend told me its fun to discuss politics while driving as time pasts fast you know
74,Fun really depends on your point of view I think. I'm pretty simple. I grew up in the restaurant business. No politics in food service. 
74,so you would be a good cook I suppose 
74,I'm not bad.  I want to open up a bakery when I retire. 
74,Wow I love the smell of bakery foods
74,Same. The smell of fresh baked bread is heavenly isn't it?
74,"No doubt, you would love to be in that smell and eat something fresh right from there"
74,I do enjoy it. What made you get in the talk show business?
75,She broke her foot :(
75,i hope she is gonna be ok
75,"I think she will be, thanks. I was so worried when I heard but you should see her car. she's lucky"
75,oh thats wonderful!  who's fault was it? was she wearing her seatbelt?
75,other driver fell asleep :( but they are in critical condition. it was an older guy
75,"oh wow, i hope he recovers too.  you hear these types of sad stories all the time... you'd think people would pull over if they are sleepy?"
75,you'd think :( i think he had several jobs and was going from one to the other
75,well hopefully your sister will be back on her feet in no time!  We have some good doctors in this day and age
75,definitely. she had some robot surgery on her foot!
75,"wow, how long did that take?  sounds like something they could record one day so we could all see how its done"
75,"it was four hours. apparently it's a lot better than a human, as far as making mistakes. i bet they do record them"
75,yeah maybe to teach up and coming doctors.  but thats good that it was an option for your sister.  i hope she recovers quickly.
76,Yeah man I'm sure I would love to be in Florida and go on some beaches and enjoy
76,"Yes, the beaches there would be really fun to go explore. Plus lots of sight seeing and rock collecting"
76,I would love to go on beach and lye down and read twilight series
76,That sounds amazing. Who is your favorite character?
76,The girl you know she's so true character
76,You mean Bella. I love her!! I am also Team Edward.
76,Some of the books are like you want to read and read again 
76,"I've never read the books, but I watch the movies over and over."
76,well now its so media there that you can watch even movie on the beach
76,I would love to watch a movie on the beach next to a bon fire.
76,that such a cool idea and Florida beaches are always warm
76,"Do you have any other hobbies? I like collecting things, mostly rocks and dragonball Z figures."
77,That's true.  There aren't a lot of dog facilities at the beach unfortunately.  I've got a small Beagle. 
77,"Although many beaches have manmade structures such as hotels, wild beaches are valued for their untouched beauty"
77,They are special. Untouched by human progress. 
77,I have actually never been to one of them just for that reason.
77,You prefer the ones that have been sanitized for human consumption?
77,"no, but me and my siblings made a pact never to ruin natural beaches"
77,That was very good of you.  I can't say the same. I enjoy the feeling of being away from humanity.  
77,i agree . i just don't like sand .
77,Fair enough. I wish you could catch shrimp the way you can catch crabs. I love shrimp. Especially in BBQ sauce. 
77,Shrimp is an important type of seafood. They are so tasty!
77,Right?  I've got an unhealthy liking for them fried and dipped in BBQ but I like them tossed in butter and garlic as well. Scampi for the win!
77,man i LOVE shrimp!
78,"Cool, I am a janitor."
78,oh nice how old is she? I have a dog as well and he is the bomb dot com.
78,I like to drink whiskey.
78,"whiskey is good with the right food, what is your favorite?"
78,I like any kind.
78,"bourbon from america is my favorite, it just hits the spot.  how long have you been drinking?"
78,I have been drinking since i was a teen.
78,"oh thats cool, so you are a professional drinker.  What else do you enjoy doing besides drinking?"
78,"No, I clean for a living."
78,I know all about cleaning.  I used to help my dad keep his butcher shop tidy when I was a kid.
78,"Cool, it is a good skill to have."
78,"yes, i have learned the more skills you have, the more valuable you are.  What do you do for a living?"
79,"Yes, I am also a lumberjack."
79,"Wow, you must be strong. I juggle in the circus, taking after my dad and granddaddy."
79,I love the circus.
79,Have you seen the work they put into a circus?
79,No I haven't but I would love to.
79,"I love being in the circus, but I always feel bad for the animals."
79,Yes I agree with you.
79,"And the tightrope walkers, they are amazing. Tell me about being a lumberjack."
79,I try to cut down trees as fast as I can.
79,Is it dangerous?
79,"Yes, the ax I use is big."
79,I hope they pay you well for working so hard.
80,I really did. It was beautiful up there. Have you ever been there?
80,No i have never been but i hope i am able to one day.
80,I hope you are able to. There were so many trees there!
80,Have you ever been to Alaska?
80,I haven't but I bet it's very similar. Have you ever been?
80,Yeah I go every year. I love it there
80,Oh that's really cool. What do you do for a living?
80,I'm a street pharmacist.
80,Is that a code for something or is that a legit job?
80,"It's not legal but I don't hurt anybody. Natural medicines only, you know?"
80,Yeah I get it.. Everyone has to make a living somehow. It must pay pretty well if you can afford to go to Alaska every year
80,"Yeah, it's not bad. I can't lie. What do you do for a living?"
81,You get paid to be a stepfather?
81,"Well the step dad I had did, or at least that's what he told me when he wasn't ignoring me."
81,Sounds like you had it rough
81,"A tiny bit I guess, I'm sure some had it worse just kinda hard hearing ""You have your dad's brains"" when I never met him."
81,oh wow :( i'm so sorry
81,It's okay. I'm just trying hard to change myself so it's been getting better. Sorry for being a downer.
81,It's OK. We all have our issues. My best friend is from Tanzania and his whole tribe got wiped out.
81,"Oh man that's horrible, was this recent or when he was younger?"
81,Younger. He was five when he moved. Just him and his sister.
81,"Oh man I hope they've been able to move past it okay, that's gotta be hard if they remember any of it."
81,He's mostly OK. Been in therapy for a long time :( world can be hard
81,Yeah it can :( but you're a good friend for caring. I know we just met but if you can say that about him and my issues you're pretty awesome.
82,just ordered some pizza and stayed glued to the tv all day
82,What was on? Must have been good TV.
82,just some tv shows and documentaries
82,Any news shows? Political stuff? I enjoy watching the news and make it a point to keep up to date on politics. 
82,am not that interested in politics would prefer soccer instead
82,Who do you follow? We just got a soccer team recently and it's been a great experience.  
82,am a Manchester united fan what about you?
82,MLS here. Atlanta United. 
82,wow. that's fine any other hobbies?
82,Welding and woodworking. I like to create things. 
82,so how is work lately?
82,It's not terrible. I work in a law firm and deal with mostly real estate. Talk about boring. 
83,"well I still do a lot, I love skating"
83,Can you do any 
83,I can do a lot of tricks
83,how long have you been skating ?
83,oh since I was a kid and we all dress in black
83,Why do you all dress in black?
83,It is my favorite color and I was the leader
83,"Well, you must be popular!  Do you listen to music while you skate?"
83,"Yeah all kinds of music, you like music?"
83,I do like music of all kinds. But my biggest interest is gaming.  I've figured out a way to make a living at it!
83,oh gaming is fun
83,"yeah ! since a kid , i'd usually play before bed , and just kept getting better"
84,Me either haha! But they sound like Pokemon if anything
84,"They do, lol. I wonder if they have Pokemon shaped pasta. "
84,Hey as someone in marketing that would be a great pitch xD maybe if we pitch it to them we can get some money on it.
84,"yeah , that's a great idea . That could help me pay for more pasta to eat !"
84,"The best plan! I think we just made our way into the world of the rich, it'll be a great story for the kids"
84,"Sounds like you are good at your job, always on the look out for something new and creative."
84,"They push it in your head enough, I sometimes get nightmares of billboards @_@ don't tell anyone."
84,"I won't tell anyone. Sorry they work you so hard. If we get rich from our pasta, you can start to relax."
84,"Heck yeah! Best way to retire ever, we can work out in the pasta shaped pool"
84,That sounds like a great plan. I can catch up on all the books I've been wanted to read that I don't have time for.
84,"Oooooh yeah! I love reading, have any favorites?"
84,"Any and all fiction, even historical fiction. "
85,I'm a competitive racer myself.  
85,A race with running or with cars?
85,Skiing.  I love to ski. 
85,"That's awesome, I do too! I love the rich history behind it, there were Norwegian army units skiing for sport all the way back in the 18th century."
85,It does have quite the history. 
85,History is one my favorites as well!
86,We're going to Halloween Horror Nights. Have you ever been?
86,"I haven't! Too scared to actually try, sadly. "
86,Oh I love horror. Still not sure if I want to go on any rides though
86,"Ha, me too but I still like do it with the kids. I prefer to spend the night telling scary stories, and watching horror films."
86,Oh that sounds like a good time. Do you like roller coasters?
86,"I love roller coasters a lot, but I'll tell ya, I can't do the wild mouse single car style ones. They jerk me around a little too much."
86,Oh jerking around isn't very fun at all. That's why I'm afraid to try them
86,Maybe you can have them get you on one of the kiddie ones first?
86,Ha that would be funny to see. I may try that. 
86,"i recommend it , lol . what else do you like to do ?"
86,I love animals so I work with them for a living. What about you?
86,"Oh that is nice, have any pets? I love to play soccer in my spare time. "
86,I love animals so I work with them for a living. What about you?
87,yeah I dont know what I should do.  If i should let them know or buy a new one and hope they dont notice.
87,You could replace the handle I suppose. I'd just let them know what happened and ask if they'd like for me to replace it with the same kind. 
87,thanks for the advice.  I think it will be my best route going forward.  I need stop worrying about it and get back to my project
87,True story. What sort of project are you working on? Home remodeling? Automotive?
87,I am working on a battle bot robot so I can enter a competition through my school 
87,That's really cool.  I've never built a bot before. I mostly work on cars. I've got a Mustang I'm getting ready to drag race. 
87,Cars are very coold as well however robots are much cheaper to work with at my age.  Maybe when I get older i'll restore a mustang.
87,Maybe you'll have robots to restore by then.  
87,yeah you never know what the world will be like in 10 years!
87,You really don't. Does that involve a lot of programming work or is it mostly mechanical?
87,It just depends on how complex you want to get.  We have some basic bots that can cause a lot of damage with not much programming involved.
87,That's nice.  I wish I was into something more active myself.  I walk a couple miles a day to try and stay fit but it's not enough. 
88,It's been a difficult time lately.  Lost my cat six months ago.
88,Yikes. That's a tough one.  How did it happen. 
89,What would she have to do that was so unpleasant?
89,"my mom is a janitor, what about you, what do you do for living? "
89, I am in between jobs right now. I pretty much hang out at home playing games and listening to music.
89,what kind of music do you like? i love pop music 
89,Pop is cool.  I have been listening to the violist Lindsey Stirling lately.
89,"i never heard anything about her, is good ? "
89,Yeah!  She covers a lot of video game soundtracks!
89,"i'm more of watching cartoons in my free time, i used to play in my old nintendo 64"
89,WHat cartoons do you like?  I love Bob's Burgers!
89,"bob's burguer is great! i also like res and stimpy, rick and morty, the simpsoms"
89,Rick and Morty is so funny!  A new season is about to start I think next month!
89,"yes! in november, all the ""bad "" morty thing is gonna be very exciting"
90,"Yeah, she's been great. Especially since she puts up with me and the four shepherds she adopted when she married me."
90,You guys sound like a strong family! What do you do for a living?
90,"I work at a dealership as of recently, kinda nice? The cars are fun to drive. How about yourself?"
90,"I'm just a boring accountant. For fun, I go around the country and go to all Bruno Mars concerts."
90,OOoo now that sounds like a fun pass-time
90,"Yeah I enjoy it. My wife, not so much."
90,"Ha! They're great for putting up with us, but I'm sure she's fine with it if it makes you happy."
90,"She thinks it silly, but that's ok. I just can't help it. Do you have any fun hobbies?"
90,"I love listening to music actually, jamming to some now."
90,"Ooo, what are you listening to?"
90,"Bit of an old band actually, The Rescues."
90,that sounds like an interesting band . i may have to look them up .
91,"Same here, I am almost getting blown over in the wind, it's so strong!"
91,It's slightly windy though but nice. I'm thinking about throwing a tarp on my vegetables out back.
91,Good idea. I'd like to get a few more weeks out of my herb garden. What do you grow?
91,Mostly fruit trees and some shrubs.
91,Nice. I grew tomatoes this year but they got eaten by critters! I'd love to have fruit trees.
91,"Yeah pests a nuisance. I advise getting rid of them by predation, parasitism, herbivory and other ways."
91,I just gave up after a while. At least they don't touch my herbs. I love cooking. Do you?
91,I do too. I have some fantastic recipes if you need them.
91,I collect recipes. People are surprised that I love to cook because I'm so skinny.
91,"well skinny is always good , as long as you are following your hearts desire for food."
91,"Yes, it helps that I absolutely love fresh fruits and vegetables!"
91,i agree . i also like to eat just the right amount of fruit and vegetables to get my protein .
92,Yeah it always helps to have people you can count on with the way the world is today!  He always comes through for me.
92,i agree . another thing we can do to fix the world we live in .
92,what would be the first thing you would fix ?
93,I love all of those as well. Do you make your own tacos?
93,i do too . with white queso . not that tex mex nacho cheese crap .
93,"Yeah, that stuff is nasty. I love white queso"
93,yes it is very good . i like how it taste .
93,Do you like to go swimming?
93,yes . i'm not good at swimming which is a problem sometimes .
93,Why is it a problem?
93,I think its because the human body is less dense than water so water supports the body weight ie we don't get tired
93,I really love swimming. Do you swim in the pool or ocean?
93,"No, we just go for my kids to swim and wear themselves out."
93,"Haha, that's smart. Swimming always wears me out too. It's almost winter, so can they swim indoors anywhere?"
93,"Yea I hope they are happy with that, Then I am happy too "
94,I like to dance too. I also play music in a band with my sister.
94,That's cool.  What kind of band do you play in?
94,Its a grunge band. We are trying to bring back the genre. 
94,Grunge?  That's pretty cool!  I haven't played in a band since high school. 
94,Oh you were in a band too? sweet! What do you do now? I work at a coffee shop on the side
94,"Marching band.  Not as cool, I'm afraid.  I'm a lab tech in a cancer research institute. "
94,"Haha marching band is cool enough. Wow thats incredible, thanks for your service!"
94,Thank you.  We're hoping to do some good.  What do you do?
94,Just work at a coffee shop while we try to get our band off the ground. I don't have many skills. But Im having fun!
94,Nothing wrong with that.  Music is important.  Coffee is also important!  :)
94,Yea I can certainly make a mean cup of coffee haha.
95,"yes,we have being friends for a very long time"
95,Yall must have been friends for a long time then.
95,so are you married?
95,"I don't really believe in marriag, but i have a lot of time with my girlfriend "
95,so how long have you been in a relationship?
95,about ten years and six months what about you? 
95,wow that's very long giving that you don't want to commit.mine just 2 years
95," yep! i think mariage is just a paper, what else do you need if you are in love, sorry i talk a lot "
95,good thinking man.there is a lot to explore before that. any hobbies?
95,"Mainly Youtube, I do some freelance work on it occasionally, i like to go out on weekends, i really like driving do you have a car?"
95,yea a small ford to get around in
95,i'm more of toyota 
95,so you know more about cars?
96,To become a lawyer
96,Oh nice! My brother in law is a lawyer and I remember him trying to get certain jobs he wanted and it not being easy sometimes.
96,"Oh wow good for him! Yea its very difficult, I went to law school but then never got a job so I went into accounting. What do you do?"
96,I'm a financial analyst. Extremely boring work.  I wanted to be a Vet though growing up.
96,"Ah, sounds very lucrative though. Do you have hobbies?"
96,i do not have any hobbies .  Too busy with my boring job!
96,"Haha aww, that's a shame. You have to have hobbies! Is there anything you wish you had more time to do?"
96,"I would like to volunteer at an animal shelter.  I really love animals, especially dogs."
96,Well I hope you get a chance to. I love animals as well. Do you have a dog?
96,"nope , would love one eventually . what kind of dog do you have ?"
96,"I have a yorkie, he is a handful. But I do love him. Why dont you get one?"
96,I live in a small apartment and am at work too much to take care of one properly.
97,"No, I am too busy with my ten year old son."
97,well thats good that you are focusing on your child as they should always come first but you do need your own time with friends as well
97,Yes I don't talk to many friends from high school.
97,"most people dont once they ""grow up,"" do you have anyone at work that you can talk to ?"
97,Yes but I am generally quiet.
97,that sounds a lot like me.  I always try to observe and then choose wisely.
97,Yes it is smart to be like that.
97,i do that until I figure out who is someone I want to get close or i know i should stay away from them
97,That is probably wise.
97,how far away are your friends? maybe plan a quick trip to spend the day with them if they are free.
97,"I am far away, it would require a lot of planning."
97,maybe you all could meet up somewhere in between just to spend time together.  Im sure if they are good friends you all could figure something out 
98,"Wow cool, I would love to go to that!"
98,You should. I've gone on a couple of occasions and it's very impressive. Especially the Mexican food they serve.
98,Oh I love Mexican food! Horseback riding is definitely my passion. My boys love it too!
98,"I love horses, but not as much as music. What other interests do you have?"
99,Spot on. I wonder why i bother anymore haha
99,"Me too, I have a friend like that.  Feel like their parent sometimes. "
99,"I dont know if they get fed up with all the advice. Like, sorry I care about you? "
99,"It's a good thing to care, but you have to be careful not to burn out.  My friend likes to burn herself for her friends."
99,True there need to be a balance. 
99,Very true.  Can't help someone if you take yourself out.  
99,"Pretty much, I am from Algeria and we're big on that. Gotta bring your own life in order first. "
99,Exactly.  I hate to ask my friend for help because I know she can't say no.  
99,Yea and you feel like you're pressurizing them that away. And feel bad afterwards/ 
99,That's it precisely.  I try not to ask unless I'm desperate and to help in return when I can. 
99,Yea as a last resort kind of thing. Pay them back later to show I appreciate them. 
99,"Yeah, and it's been a hard year and I don't make a a lot so it's difficult to show my appreciation like I want to. "
100,Great to meet a fellow nurse. Do you ride horses as well?
100,"no,but i would love to if i were able to get one to teach me how to"
100,You mean a talking horse that can teach you how to ride? I wish my horse talked to me.
100,no i mean someone to put me through talking horse is a wish
100,I encourage my horse to talk to me after I drink a lot of Budweiser but he never listens.
100,i am pretty sure he does but you have to be sober to hear
100,"Exactly, the hard part is staying sober when your fridge is stocked with nothing but Budweiser."
100,have you tried other brands?
100,Other brands are way too bitter.
100,even vodka?
100,"Yeah, i don't think i'll ever betray Budweiser."
100,wow such a loyal drinker.it hard to find someone like you
101,"you are very knowledgeable, do you prefer nsync or bsb?"
101,"i don't have a preference, they are both great. All 3 of my kids get annoyed when I listen to them though."
101,"haha kids of this days don't know them, i'm 46 and i still enjoying them, my kids only listen k-pop"
101,"Sometimes I sing their songs in Italian, that really annoys them lol."
101,"italian?haha that's strange, i only talk english and a little spanish "
101,"My parents barely speak English, so I was taught both.  By the way, what is k-pop?"
102,What do you want
102,A new Porsche. I like having expensive things so people notice me haha.
102,Dang. I'm the complete opposite
102,Well I hope one day you get what you want :)
102,i just want to die happy
102,dont we all :)
102,I think so
102,Just gotta live to the fullest before we get to that point. 
102,I guess so. I like being free in my daily life
102,"Me too, I like being a clown and get other peoples' attention. "
102,thats fun. I like making people laugh
102,Yea it makes me feel relevant. 
103,who is your favorite snowboarder?
103,shawn white what about you?
103,I like him too but I have never seen him in completition just reality shows that he has appeared on.  Is he really good?
103,he is pretty good! and definitely cool to watch
103,i would imagine that you have to be pretty talented to be able to be a fringe athlete and become a household name.
103,"yea, it talent quite run in the family tho"
103,does he have other siblings who are also professional ?
103,i don't think so as he kept that part secluded
103,that is always a good idea to keep family out of the limelight if they arent into that type of thing
103,yup 100%
103,i think i'll stick to my horses instead of hitting the slopes.
103,i also like horse riding but have got no horse
104,I read about the sit ins in school.  I think boycotts are very important now.
104,"Yes. Many people focusing action by word of mouth at the local, regional and national levels."
104,"Now that we have the internet and social media, we can spread the word much faster."
104,agreed. the power of the internet is so strong. more people should get involved to make a change.
104,Very true.  I'd love to get involved in local politics are try to make changes personally. 
104,giant changeyes big changes won't really work without a strong foundation. Do you have any ideas?
104,"The big issue is gerrymandering and getting big money out of politics.  If our votes mean nothing, we can't affect change."
104,Did you vote in the last election?
104,Yes.  At my work with a friend.  You?
104,I did. I voted for Donald Trump. Who did you vote for?
104,President wasn't up for the last election.  I voted for the house and senate with my conscience.  
104,"Oh okay, and who was that? Trump or Hillary?"
105,"So do I, I read a lot of stories about stuff like that and they make me so mad."
105,I don't read more as more reading made me almost bald now
105,Why do you think reading made you bald?
105,Because I continuously keep on scratching my head during reading.
105,Oh i see. You must not like reading as much as I do. I read every day.
105,The other day I went to a book store and ran into Jimmy Fallon
105,"Oh that's cool! My parents, who have been married for 40 years, watch Jimmy Fallon every night."
105,He's funny guy no doubt
105,Yeah I really enjoying watching him. Has he written any books that you know of?
105,"Not really, I do see his shows only though"
105,I got it. Any other late night hosts you enjoy?
105,Stephan colbert is also another one I like
106,Sometime it is scary as I love forest and live near one in rural area.
106,"oh i know what you're saying i like to hike, sometimes i camp and the noise are very scary "
106,Yeah living in such places make you lazy and more food eater
106,"i don't think so, but tell me wha do you do for living ? "
106,"I'm a consultant and work mostly remotely with companies, how about u"
106,i work in advertising 
106,Man you guys make food ads so interesting to make people think about food all the time.
106,"yeah, that's right but we use a lot of tricks to make food looks tasty"
106,Well living in forest and work remote and thinking about food is not making me healthy anymore
106,You know lifestyle changes can help
106,I do really need some change I imagine
106,"ya , you have to change if you want to do certain things"
107,Well people love to pretend to be super heros by watching such movies
107,What is your favorite super hero movie?
107,Mostly I like Batman and I remember when my parents use to take and my brother  to see these movies when I was little
107,I like Iron Man because he is red
107,And because he's more human than other Super heros
107,"Batman does not have parents anymore, I am lucky to have parents and live with them"
107,That is nice how old are you parents?
107,"My parents are about 40 years old, I love them!"
107,Lucky you living with them
107,I love when my parents take me to see Marvel films
107,"good for you, enjoy spending the time with them as much as you can"
107,Thank you! What do you like to do in your spare time?
108,that's great I usually spend my time skating or skiing during here in colorado
108,I love Colorado.
108,"Me too, especially during the winter months. It's just so beautiful."
108,I avoid the winter months. I like to go up to southern Colorado in the summer.
108,"Oh yea, is that a good time to go camping?"
108,"Yes, that's what I do, avoid the heat and hit the high mountains."
108,I've been camping out there a few times myself but I'm usually to scared of running into a wild animal to go anymore.
108,"Oh, the only wild animals that have bothered me have been racoons and skunks."
108,Yea it's generally safe but sometimes I hear tales of people running into moose and bears. 
109,"I think those who refrain from that are vegans, not vegetarians."
109,yes that is right.  i struggle with my identity in more ways than one and being a vegan and a meateater is one 
109,I'm sorry you struggle. Why not just be you and not label yourself?
109,thats true but it can be hard when you got a family full of vegans but love brisket and chicken tenders at the same time
109,"I hear you, but I say love what you love eating. My favorite food is pasta btw."
109,"pasta is always good, what type is your favorite?"
109,I love the multicolored ones! Makes me feel like a child again!

109,I love chicken alfredo too! Do you have a favorite dessert?!
109,strawberry cheese cake is my fav.  how about you?
109,"Weirdly, I like cheesecake but not the bottom bit. I give that bit to my husband!"
109,thats where all the good stuff settles!
109,"Nah, not me! Too sugary and soggy for me."
110,I live in Texas.
110,I love Texas the food there is really good don't you think? 
110,Yes I agree. The best part however is that I live in an area where I can ride my bicycle to work.
110,yea! and a good deal on the gas right ? 
110,"It's pretty good, but I don't have to spend money on gas. My daily driver is a bicycle that I pedal with my hands."
110,"yea! that's cool, i live in new york, the best here is go to work on the subway "
110,"I used to ride a subway. It was too noisy for me so I would always listen to music (u2, my favorite band)."
110,"i do not really listen to music , what is your favorite song by u2 ?"
110,I'm torn and can't just pick one favorite song. What is your favorite band or song?
110,"i don't like any, elevation is the more famous "
110,"Well, what else are you interested in?"
110,i like watching old cartoons like tom and jerry or animaniacs 
111,"i do not like star wars, was just hating on it last night to a friend about disney now owning them"
111,"They have sold out, for sure. I work at Walmart and can't believe all the Star Wars merchandise now."
111,"anyways, how is that turking life working for you?"
111,"It's OK. I'd be better paid if I worked as a mechanic like my dad though, LOL."
111,"i hear you, i rather be doing this though just because if the perks of not having to conform"
111,"Well, that's for sure.  No need to dress to impress! "
111,"i got fired from my last job for saying ""good luck getting through the VA system"""
111,Oops! Were you a VA employee at the time?
111,"Well, kinda but not really, outsourced to them, me being a disabled vet, the irony"
111,"Oh, geez. I'm so sorry. Thank you for your service though.  I hope you are doing OK."
111,"thank you its getting better though, my life post army has been a real circus,. just enjoying life now"
111,That is good. I wish i could say that about myself. I'm feeling stuck in life.
112,why won't it matter then?
112,Well I'm allergic to Lactose and if I mistakenly take it my face can show that upfront
112,"oh, that sounds highly unpleasant! is there any medication you can take for that or you just have to avoid it completely?"
112,"Yeah I try my best, So do you like music?"
112,"i love music. my favorite genres are hip hop, jazz, and classic rock. how about you?"
112,I like Justin Bieber as his songs are different
112,my cousin is obsessed with him but i personally haven't listened to much of his stuff yet
112,Who do you like in music?
112,"i like wu-tang clan, action bronson, led zeppelin, jimi hendrix, and a bunch more"
112,Thats nice what kind of videos they make usually
112,the first two make silly videos
112,but silly videos are fun as well
113,Its when you achieve this state of blissful flow after pushing your body to its limit on a run. 
113,i don't think i have reached such a state before
113,Yes its difficult to achieve. very few people are able to do so.
113,are you part of the few?
113,"Maybe, I can't say for sure. I have experienced something like it before but not often enough."
113,do you run frequently?
113,Only when I get free time from my editing job haha.
113,what are the reason behind it?
113,Could be a physiological or biological phenomenon. we still have much to learn about it. 
113,so how many kids?
113,"One, I am moving out soon to have more space for my wife and him. "
113,hope it wouldn't be far from them?
114,"I haven't either, but would be totally open to donating. "
114,I try to donate things whenever I can. I wish more people did.
114,"I do to. If you can help, you should, that's what I think. What kind of music do you like?"
114,My prefer is Rock but I can listen any kind Romantic or even  pop
114,"I like pretty much everything, except for country."
114,"When I volunteer at the animal shelter cleaning cages and whatnot, i love to listening to rock. It gets me amped up."
114,That's really nice of you to volunteer! 
114,I really enjoy it. The only problem is that I have to keep my very long blonde hair out of the dog  poop!
114,"That's so funny that you would say that, I have long blonde hair too, down to my knees!!"
114,Really? Mine also reaches my knees! It's a curse and a blessing.
114,I couldn't agree more! But I can't ever imagine cutting it.
114,do you at least get it trimmed ?
115,Nature is magical the way she works. I think we're a bit like plants too.
115,yes is amazing! i don't understand why you said we are like plants?
115,"Because we need water, air and the sun like plants do."
115,"ohhhh okay that makes more sense i'm only ten, is difficult to undestand for me but you're right "
115,Plants are my thing. Love them. Do you have any plants?
115,"i have an orange plant, i love orange juice in the morning "
115,An orange plant sounds beautiful! Orange juice is cool too. Do you like it smooth or with bits?
115,with bids! i like the texture
115,Agreed! I prefer it with bits too! Do you have any pets?
115,"i have two dogs and a turtle, what about you? "
115,Oh wow! I love turtles! I'm scared of dogs though (childhood fear). I have a lizard.
115,"Very cool lizards, I like their beards."
116,"Wow, for how long?"
116,It's been 7 months since I proposed.
116,Congratulations! How'd you do it?
116,I put the ring on the seat of one of the self driving cars I work on and drove it to her.
116,"That's so sweet; much more technologically advanced than we used to do it, haha"
116,Yeah I'm really into computers and so I thought it would be cool to use technology when I asked. Do you like computers?
116,"I do, although I have to admit I don't know nearly as much about them as you do."
116,have you ever programmed before? I work for google on many different projects like self driving cars most recently.
116,"I've dabbled. Used an app learn. I just don't think my brain works like that, unfortunately "
116,Do you think self-driving cars would help you out in your life?
116,I'm sure they world. They'd probably be safer. What programming languages do you know?
116,"Java, Python, C to name a few. What kind of work do you do?"
117,Pavlov was fascinating. classical conditioning sticks even when you don't remember it happening.
117,"Well but I forget things occasionally as well, like my mind is getting weak"
117,"I have ADHD, so my memory is either spectacular or terrible depending on the moment.  "
117,Well whatever so what you like in food?
117,Spicy!  I love something with heat.  You?
117,"Same here it seems we could be from same origin, LOL"
117,I'm southern.  Discovered a my inner foodie in college really.  It was a bit of a surprise. 
117,I have adopted the taste and now love spaghetti and meatballs 
117,That's good too!  a well done meatball is excellent.  I hear the secret is to cook them in the sauce.
117,Well whatever sauce it is as long as meatballs are there I'm good and happy
117,I hear that.  I need to try to cook them at some time.  
117,What else you do for living?
118,how did i miss that beautiful part of the city
118,I like to drive around in the country to explore things.
118,so you like traveling?
118,Yeah especially with a friend to chat on the long drives
118,any other hobbies?
118,Well this is time consuming enough for me how about you?
118,i don't go around that much because of work
118,What kind of work you do that does not let you go
118,i'm a babysitter
118,that's nice so you get along with babies well I imagine
118,pretty natural
118,Something does it bother you or you like to be around babies
118,no as it is a good thing
119,"I don't know, maybe they find it inconvenient, but it's worth it. "
119,"i'm studant and i've done several campaigns in school to promote recycling, it is very important"
119,That's awesome! I'm hoping the future generations will realize the importance. I also like to grow my own vegetables.
119,it is a good thing to do . motivating as well .
119,I'm thinking about trying to grow strawberries in the spring. I could use them in pies.
119,"sounds very tasty, i love all the berries"
119,"I love to bake pies, it's probably my number one hobby."
119,What sorts of pie did yo umake?
119,"Apple pie is my specialty, but I also like key lime. Do you bake?"
119,"I do often cook apple pies, a classic US comfort food"
119,"It's great with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream, especially when it's right out of the oven!"
119,"Oh man, the ice cream sandwich with the two wafers. So delicious!"
120,headphones
120,do you prefer headsets or earbuds ?
120,headsets because they're louder
120,I gotcha. I bought mine online too. where do you live?
120,my dad had a heartattack so i'm visiting ga from florida
120,"oh im so sorry to hear that, i live in the countryside"
120,wow sounds beautiful
120,"i is, at least i have a lot of fresh vegetables"
120,oh wow my girlfriend loves to cook with fresh veggies
120,"great, do you like her food? i hate how my wife cooks, but i don't have an alternative"
120,i kind of like it. sometimes i would prefer fast food
120,"Yeah, I like a lot of fast food, because my work life is so busy. But I'm trying to eat healthier everyday."
121,"That's really cool, have you been a fan of basketball for a long time?"
121,Since as long as I can remember. I'm trying to get my sons into basketball.
121,Oh how exciting! Do they enjoy it much? You guys must watch games together I'm guessing.
121,They're starting to enjoy it. Though they are a little young. Do you have any kids?
121,"Oh how fun. I don't, I'm a little too focused on my musical career right now to have any. "
121,That is nice. I'm guessing music a big part of your life?
121,"Oh yes, I love playing the violin. I've been working on it for a long time. Do you enjoy music?"
121,I do. I actually play guitar. How long have you been playing the violin?
121,"Wow that's fun, I would love to learn guitar. I have been playing violin since I was 10 years old, so more than a decade!"
121,"Wow, that is dedication! I'm sure you're fantastic at it."
121,"I think I'm okay but I still need more years before I'm fantastic, haha. Have you played guitar for long?"
121,For like 5 years. I still consider myself a novice though. It's hard to practice these days.
122,I read it about it.
122,I've been reading about sweaters actually and just got a new one.
122,I am an art teacher. I see art all the time
122,That's really cool! How do you like being an art teacher?
122,I love it .It is my passion.What do you do for a living??
122,I work at a fast food place right now. Probably why I eat too many fries!
122,Just make sure you try and eat more healthier foods also
122,I definitely try and eat healthy when I can. Are you a healthy eater?
122,Not as much as I would want it. My problems is that I eat to much Italian
122,"That doesn't sound like a problem, Italian food is delicious."
122,But it also has lot's of carbs
122,"That is true, but it's worth it as a treat once in a while."
123,You can pickle fruit???
123,"I'm pretty sure you can, but I never have."
123,I don't think I'd like pickled fruit very much - YUCK!  Do you have a favorite food?
123,"Honestly, if I had to pick just one favorite food, I'd say pickled eggs. I love pickling them, so I always have a bunch to eat!"
123,"Well, I definitely have a least favorite food - sweet potatoes - I cannot eat them in any way."
123,Did you have a bad experience with them at some point?
123,"No, I just cannot stand the taste of them at all.  Love pumpkin, regular potatoes, but not these."
123,"Oh, I see. What do you like to do for fun in your spare time?"
123,I love love love to lift weights! What about you?
123,"That sounds like fun! I like to mess around with hair, try to create some new, unusual styles."
123,Oh I bet that is a lot of fun!  Do you do it for a living?
123,"Maybe someday, but it's just a fun hobby for now."
124,"I'm a pretty big fan of Black Flag and Misfits too. What about you, what other bands do you like?"
124,I haven't but I will check them out.  Queen is one of my absolute favorites.  I like the Decemberists too. 
124,"That's cool, have you ever had the opportunity to see any of your favorite artists play live?"
124,I've seen the Decemberists in concert. And Bon Jovi once.  How about you?
124,"Oh that must have been pretty fun! I've been lucky enough to have seen Black Flag quite a while ago, it was great. Do you play any instruments yourself?"
124,"I used to play the trumpet, the baritone and the piano.  I miss Piano.  "
124,"Wow, you're quite multi-talented there. How come you no longer play them anymore?"
124,I no longer have a piano and I live in an apartment.  No way to practice the trumpet without disturbing the neighbors.
124,"Aw I'm sorry to hear that, I hope one day you're able to pick them up again in some way. So what do you do for work?"
124,"It's okay, someday I'll have a house and can get a piano I'm a lab tech at a cancer institute.  You?"
124,"That's a good attitude to have. That sounds like an interesting job, do you enjoy it? I work nights outside a punk rock club, I watch the door for them."
124,It's very interesting.  Very busy.  I bet you see some interesting people.  
125,Scrapbooking can be so time consuming though. It is a lot of work.
125,"Yes, it is. Would have been a lot easier if I could have done it online."
125,"I'm sure she would have appreciated that option! I'm not really into scrapbooking, but I do sew clothes for myself and other people."
125,I'd rather read a Harry Potter book than scrapbook or sew!
125,What is your favorite book in that series? I've heard of those books but I've never read them.
125,They are great and you should give them a read!  I even went to the Harry Potter exhibit at Universal!
125,I love Universal! I'm a big fan of theme park rides.
125,Which theme park ride is your favorite?
125,I really like the Hippogriff ride.
125,i don't know any thing about that one !  Where is it at?
125,It is actually in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter.
125,I must have missed that one somehow.  I will look out for that one next time!
126,"i have a husband and two kids,what about you ? "
126,"I have a dog but I don't have kids yet, I'm not ready for the full responsibility lol."
126,"haha i feel you! i used to think like that, now i hate tht i can't go shopping as long as i wanted to, but i don't have complains"
126,"I can imagine that, I don't do too much shopping myself but I do have some hobbies I'm sure I'd miss doing alone, if I had kids."
126,and what do you do for living ? 
126,"Mainly Youtube, I do some freelance work on it occasionally, and Reddit. Lots of Reddit."
126,"freelance work is great you don't have to see people in person every day,i hate when people get too close at wok"
126,Yep that's exactly why I prefer to live this way. What do you do for work?

127,"she will love it! also is a very good hobby, do you have any hobbies? "
127,My wife and I like to go out to dinner. What about you?
127,"we like to stay at home, watch something in netflix and just enjo the time you know ? "
127,"Yeah, we can't do a lot because of my wife being deaf. Makes it difficult"

127,"that's beautiful, and do you have any pets? "

130,OMG! I just saw a snake go by!

130,I know. It looked like a cobra but it was probably a grass snake.
130,"you seem very knowledgeable,i only knows about marketing "
130,what type of marketing are you into?
130,Mostly sports products.marketing 
130,"oh wow, have you worked on any big campaigns?"
130,"yes . so far i've only done commercials what about you, what do you do for living?"
130,"I am a probation officer during the day, and i always wear black!"
130,haha that's sounds nice is it? 
131,I stormed out and haven't talked to them since
131,"Oh that's too bad, I can imagine how frustrating that would feel. "
131,It's horrible. He does it all the time and my parents don't care
131,Man siblings can be tough to deal with- is he your only sibling?
131,Yeah and he's the youngest. Always been the favorite. Do you have any siblings?
131,Yes I have five siblings actually and they definitely can be a bother some days. Have you talked to your family about how you feel?
131,I have in the past and they just tell me to get over it. I can't even imagine having 5 siblings
131, We were different ages so not all five had to live together at once for more than a year or two. It's too bad they don't listen to you.
131,Oh that doesn't seem too bad. I'm just waiting until I'm 18 and then I'm going to move out and cut them out of my life
131,"Oh that's good, just enjoy it while it lasts because once you grow up you can really miss living with them."
131,Yeah I can see that. It's just going to take some time to heal. Do you get along with your parents?
131,I don't get to speak to them much anymore actually and I always really miss them and my siblings.
132,"Oh yes, I remember seeing that in a documentary.  Very interesting."
132,I wish I worked at McDonalds. Instead I work at a pizza restaurant.
132,I like Pizza better personally.  We have some really good pizza here.  
132,You should try putting hamburger on top of a pizza. It tastes great!
132,I'll do that.  Working at Mcdonalds you get so sick of the food.  Never work at a place where you like the food.
132,I agree seeing pizza everyday can make you tired of the food
132,Definitely.  I'll never work at a pizza shop or an ice cream parlor.  I like them too much
132,The best Ice cream I ever had was from a street vendor in Argentina
132,"Ooh, I've never been to Argentina."
132,You will love it! The food is amazing!
132,When did you go?
132,I went there around 2017
133,Lebron is from Ohio.
133,I get it. He doesn't want to leave his home team. I'm not really a basketball fan.
133,He won a championship there...but he wanted to go to LA for movies and stuff.
133,That makes sense. I prefer watching sci fi than basketball. What do you like to watch?
133,I was watching the show 911 and it reminded me of a time I had to use them.
133,Wow that's scary! I prefer less intense things. My favorite shows is face off.
133,"Yeah, I had a headache...turned out just to be a bad migraine. I watch a lot of sports and news."
133,That doesn't sound good. Hope you feel better!
133,I do thanks for asking. I hope you can read this as I'm using speech to text...I never wrote in school!
133,That's okay! I'm pretty organized. I can help you learn how to write better.
133,Thanks...they never really taught us...everything was watching videos and typing on machines.
133,Have you tried taking a class with a different teacher?
134,I put on stilletos
134,"oh, that seems like a lot to wear to church!"
134,It made me taller and I put on a lot of makeup
134,what kind of church do you go to?
134,church of satan
134,"oh, well that makes a lot more sense then"
134,i play blackjack there
134,i love to play blackjack! that sounds like my kind of church
134,yeah we gamble there a lot
134,that seems like it might be against the law though...
134,we dont care about laws honestly
134,"oh, i see. rebels. well that's interesting. what kind of hairstyle did you wear there?"
135,Nice! kids are great. Do you shoot? I lead a gun club and we target practice a lot.
135,"no i don't do that, i'm a digital artist"
135,That sounds interesting. How long have you been a digital artist?
135,"since i can remember i love art, then i start working on that cause was easy "
135,Nice. So you're a natural! Any plans for the weekend? I'm going golfing with my friends!
135,That should be fun. I have to work this weekend. I need to hang with friends before I go crazy
135,I can imagine. If I spend long periods without my friends I go crazy as well haha.
135,yea well i used to live in france now i moved to canada i left all my friends there 
135,That must have been tough on you. How long ago did you move?
135,about three years ago 
135,Sorry. Hopefully you will make a lot of new friends in Canada.
135,I hopep so. I like it here.where are you from 
135,I'm from America. I've lived here all my life.
136,"It did, but it felt like forever."
136,I'm sure it did. What kind of pizza did you get?
136,"Pepperoni, with mozzarella and pineapple.  "
136,"Sounds delicious! It's odd, but I like pepperoni because I like red. I think things that are red seem to just taste better."
136,"So pizza is perfect for you, red sauce, pepperoni, red peppers..."
136,Exactly! It's weird but I don't mind. Do you like anything besides pizza?
136,Most things actually.  Especially indian.  Have you tried Vindaloo?  It's delicious and red.
136,"No, that sounds weird. What is it? I'm sure I would like it if it's red."
136,"Rice, potatoes and meat with a spicy tomato curry"
136,That sounds like something I would love! You'll have to make it for me.
136,I'm not that good.  Indian is very complicated to get right.  I can recommend a good restaurant in several cities. 
136,Maybe we can try and make it together one time!
137,"Spicy wings? Must be nice, I love eating them "
137,Yeah I like trying different hot sauces on them Do you like them hot?
137,I mostly go for mild otherwise because thats about all I can handle!
137,Oh I get that. I like them hot but sometimes they're a little too spicy even for me! Do you like eating pizza with wings?
137,Pizza with wings is a match made in heaven. Love them on game day. 
137,Yeah nothing like good food and sports. Add a beer and it's like heaven. You a beer drinker?
137,"Not really, never liked the taste of it. Whats your favorite beer?"
137,I love the fall beers. Always look forward to trying the different pumpkin beers. Always tastes better when my team wins though
137,Haha everything is better when your team in winning. Even cold pizza. 
137,So true! You have anything to celebrate tonight?
137,Just thats its Friday tomorrow and weekend shenanigans are ever closer. What about you? 
137,Well I was hoping to celebrate my baseball team tonight but that's not going well. So just waiting for the weekend.
138,I could but sometimes I feel like no one will love me because of my size so I stay.
138,I don't know if it's worth staying in a less-than-happy relationship just purely out of fear. People will love you regardless of your size!
138,Even if my beer gut is so big I can't see my feet?
138,"It depends on the person but for many of us somebody's weight doesn't matter much, there's someone out there for everyone"
138,That's so sweet. I bet your in a good relationship!
138,I am! I've been with my partner for the last 2 years and he's pretty accepting. You just gotta keep looking and you'll find the right one I promise!
138,"Do you know any good ones where I live, in San Francisco? "
138,"I haven't been to San Fran before actually. But it's a big enough place that you've got so many people to choose from, oh my."
138,How did you meet your partner? 
138,"I met him on a day trip up to Canada, I like to go there sometimes to admire the scenery and he happened to be traveling there too"
138,How fun! Were you guys from the same place?
138,No but we were from cities right next to each other so after dating long distance a while he decided to move here
139,Still can't place it.  My memory for names is terrible.  Songs and people.  
139,"I get that, I can never seem to remember names. "
139,It's so embarrassing.  I don't know the name of half my office and it's been to long to ask...
139,Break room must be the worst part of your work routine I suppose. 
139,I get around it.  Just smile and chat and never mention names
139,"geez , that must make work awkward sometimes"
139,"A little, but I know all my labmates so I can manage the other people.  "
139,Thats why I wish I could work from home more often. 
139,That would be nice.  Sadly the lab is very hands on.  
139,I hope you're not experimenting on mice in there.... 
139,No mice.  Cancer cells.  They deserve it.
139,Couldn't agree more. Cancer is a group of horrible diseases. I'm glad you're fighting them .
140,So is exercise...I really should do more...like walking or jogging.
140,Exercise helps a ton! Who is your favorite band? Mine is probably pink Floyd.
140,"I work 12 hours a day 5 days a week and I'm so tired!! Yeah, I love Pink Floyd!"
140,That sounds exhausting! I'm actually in the process of looking for a second job right now. 
140,You can help me with mine! Then we can chill and listen to Dark Side of the Moon haha.
140,"Sure, that sounds like a real plan to me lol."
140,I need some music suggestions for a workout playlist...like some fast metal or something to get me hyped.
140,You should try Pantera! Metal is my jam! It will hype your workout up!
140,Yeah I have a bunch of Pantera records! I like Mastodon a lot too to get pumped.
140,I listen to them at the gym most nights when I go. I love it.
140,Cool...although I'm so stressed from work I might need to limit the aggro music lol.
140,Well maybe just listen to pink floyd to relax from work lol.
141,Yeah so grateful that there are still honest people out there
141,"Oh yeah, especially these days. I'm lucky to live in a nice town at least. "
141,That's great! What do you do for a living?
141,"I work at a bank in a small town, what about you?"
141,I am enjoying my retirement. It's nice to have freedom. How do you like working at the bank?
141,"Oh how nice, you earned that! I like it alright, it's a little weird sometimes though. I hope to move on eventually."
141,I hope you are able to find something you enjoy. 50 years working in the factory was tough. Amazing how much better I feel now
141,"Oh wow that sounds like it was hard, but you must be enjoying retirement now. What do you like to do?"
141,Honestly? I never had time to find love so I've been going on a lot of dates. Older women know what they like
141,"Oh how fun, good luck! Do you have a type?"
141,Not really. Just looking for someone nice that wants to have fun. Are you married?
142,I work with bulls.
142,Oh wow! That must be interesting! I love animals so much I became a vegan.
142,"How interesting, I am a vegetarian for that reason!"
142,Great for you! How long have you been a vegetarian?
142,Well I started working with bulls in Spain as a baby- that's where I was born and my dad worked with bulls and they were vegetarians so my whole life.
142,Do you know any bullfighters?
142,I dated a bull fighter for a few years so I used to run in that circle. 
142,"If you like bulls, it must be hard to watch bullfighting.  What else do you like?"
142,I really enjoy drinking coffee and people watching. How about you?
142,Love coffee and people watching!  I also play guitar.
142,Oh I love the guitar! Do you play acoustic or electric?
142,I play acoustic guitar. I just love the sound.
143,I told her I ate my broccoli when I really fed it to the dog!
143,Oh no!  Broccoli is so good more you.  
143,"So I've been told. I still don't feel right eating miniature trees, though."
143,It's actually a cabbage if that helps. 
143,"i did not know that. that's fascinating. cabbage is kind of gross too, though."
143,Not if done correctly.  Stir frying is the best way for cabbage.  
143,"I would consider trying some stir fried cabbage, but it'd have to be done by a competent cook. I'm no good at cooking!"
143,That's the joys of the internet.  I didn't learn until i was in my 20's.  Now I'm pretty decent.  
143,I would love to learn but I just never have the time.
143,Start small.  It's a great saver of money.  Home cooking is so much cheaper than buying out. 
143,What's your favorite dish to cook?
143,I love to cook Steak.  Nothing like a properly done steak.  
144,Writing is fun
144,My mom passed away when I was a child.   That why I want to write about her.
144,Well just start writing
144,"I know, Ii just keep procrastinating.  DO you write?"
144,Yes I have written a book
144,Wow!  What kind of book did you write?
144,Fiction book about money
144,really ? that sounds interesting .  Is it about gambling?
144,no it's about how money will not be a thing in the future
144,What do you think will be currency then?
144,there won't be currency
144,"Oh.  Not sure how that would work, but I am intrigued!"
145,No. But they served some amazing wine! It was pricey and delicious!
145,"Oh how fun, that sounds like a good night! Were you with friends?"
145,Yeah I met a few there. Do you like animals?
145,"Nice. Oh yeah, I do, I love all sorts of animals. I have no pets yet though, do you?"
145,I have a french bulldog. She is a handful but I love her so much.
145,"Oh that's cool, I'd love a dog one day. What is her name?"
145,her name is Sasha. You should get one. They're nice companions.
145," Aw pretty name, maybe I will get one! How long have you had her?"
145,About 6 years now. She is getting up there in age haha.
145,haha I bet she's a doll!  Cherish these moments!
145,I so am. Where are you from?
145,From France originally but I live in Canada. How about you?
145,I live in America. I've always wanted to live in Canada.
146,I'm a cop so I have to find some way to release my stress.
146,"you know, some stress can be healthy and good for you."
146,I hunt...it can be both relaxing and exhilarating. I don't drink and hunt though!
146,"Drinking does affect much of the body like the brain, heart, liver, and pancreas."
146,Yes and in my line of work I need to be of sound mind and body.
146,"Because of my large mustache, I always wondered if cops viewed me as dangerous, what do you think?"
146,Nah...big furry mustaches are a necessity for any real officer lol.
146,"When I left my last AA meeting, I feel as though the cop on the corner was following me."
146,Lots of people think we are following them...but I can't tell you if we really are...then they run!
146,"That's funny, maybe they have a support group for people who think cops follow them all the time."
146,"I hope you're doing well dealing with your issues, ever want to take a hunting trip let me know! It's a good time."
146,That sounds fun but I might need to work on my sobriety a little longer.
147,I don't understand why it's so difficult for people to pick up after their dogs.
147,"I know, right? People are just so lazy or don't care I guess."
147,This is why I'm a cat person. I'd rather just scoop out of a box! lol
147,That's true! I wonder if a dog could possibly be boxed trained though.
147,"I bet they can. Hey, if anyone could do it, I bet you can. Since you're smart enough to clean up after your pup :)"
147,"Haha, good point. So where abouts do you live?"
147,I live alone in the big house my ex-husband left me when we divorced a couple of years ago. You?
148,What sorts of dishes have you tried to cook before? Some sure are easier than others!
148,i've tried a few different american chinese dishes like orange chicken with fried rice
148,"That sounds delicious! I personally really like cooking italian foods, they're really rich and not the healthiest but so tasty"
148,italian food is probably my favorite type to eat. what's your favorite italian dish?
148,"Spaghetti, oh boy I could probably eat 5 pounds of it in one sitting. Yum. Have you ever been to Italy?"
148,"I've never been out of the United States, actually. One day I'd love to go to that area of the world!"
148,Oh you'll have so much fun when you start travelling. Where in the States do you live?
148,"I live in Florida. I've traveled across the US a lot, though."
148,"Florida seems lovely, I've never been but it always looks so warm. Have you lived there your whole life?"
148,"Yes, I've been here my whole life. It's too hot for me, but all my family is here so it's hard to move"
148,"Of course, it's difficult trying to move away from your loved ones, and it can be hard to find support like family. What do you do for work?"
148,I'm a web developer for a small company. I make the backend of websites
149,"Awe no, it's about hamburgers! I eat meat only and love watching movies about them!"
149,is it a rated R movie? because I cant watch it then because of my beliefs
149,"I don't pay attention to ratings, I just know it's my favorite movie!"
149,anyone famous come out in it?  were the burgers good?
149,Burgers are always yummy!
149,i could use a big burger right now
149,Me too! What's your favorite place to get a burger?
149,"i love this place called armadillos, they make 3lbs bacon cheeseburgers"
149,I love bacon as well! Yummy!
149,with some crispy lettuce and tomato always hits the spot
149,"I just like the meat, I'm not into the veggies."
149,"do you like it with fries, tots or onion rings?"
150,"He's okay now, he managed to pull through after a bit but it was sure scary at first, it's hard seeing a parent like that"
150,I know what you mean. It really makes you re-evaluate your priorities. 
150,"For sure, it's a big life changer. Do you still have both your parents?"
150,I do but my dad is actually pretty sick too. My fiance and I have decided to move up our wedding.
150,Oh my that's really rough. So you know what it's like then. How long have you known your fiance for?
150,"It's been 5 years. We were originally planning a huge wedding, but now we're just getting married in a park."
150,"That sounds nice, I personally have been to many weddings and sometimes the simpler ones are the best. When are you having the wedding?"
150,It's in 2 weeks! And then we are going to Niagara Falls for our honeymoon. Can't wait!
150,"Oh how lovely! Niagara Falls is great, I've been there before. That wedding is coming up fast, are you excited?"
150,"Yes definitely excited. Although it will be bittersweet because of my dad's health, of course. "
150,I'm so very sorry to hear that. Do you think he'll be able to walk you down the aisle still? 
150,"I think so, yes! We're trying to keep things simple, so it won't be much walking. It should be Ok."
151,12
151,My dad had a good work ethic working for UPS and taught me the importance of it.
151,yeah i just want the lil dweeb out of my house!
151,"Haha.  It can't be that bad, right?"
151,so annoying! can't wait til shes 18 and i'm back to living
151,Buy her a mustang when she turns 16 and she will never be home!  I have owned two!
151,no way. no cars for her
151,"I guess cars are a little expensive.  Hence, her getting a job."
151,yeah she should buy her own
151,It will be a better life lesson for her anyways to have to pay for it on her own.
151,I defintely agree with that
151,"Yeah, let her free."
152,Kelly. She's so great. Do you have a girlfriend?
152,"That's nice, when did you meet? I met my wife in high school but we have a daughter who just graduated now."
152,We met outside a bar when she told me she liked my car. What's your wife's name?
152,Oh it's Alison. That's nice! Do you have any shared hobbies?
152,We both love watching sports and traveling. What do you and your wife like doing? Alison is a nice name
152,"That sounds like fun, my wife and I also like to travel, and we enjoy cooking together and listening to music."
152,That sounds like you guys have a good life. I bet you're excited to have the house to yourselves
152,"Yeah, we are, it will be definitely interesting. Do you think you'll ever have kids?"
152,Probably not. Think we're a little too old at this point. I'll just spoil my niece and nephew
153,"yeah, it makes me feel great inside when i finish a run"
153,That's great. It's really healthy for you. I have a hard time running because my hair is host and gets in my face.
153,"yeah, you're probably better off using an exercise bike or something anyway because you can do it inside and it doesn't put so much stress on your joints"
153,That's true. I'm probably just going to let my hair grow out to prevent that problem though. Watched any good movies lately?
153,"i don't watch a lot of new movies, but i did just recently watch the newer blade runner movie and really enjoyed it"
153,I love that movie! I just saw Annabelle. Horror movies are my favorite!
153,it's the right season to be watching horror movies. i haven't gotten to watch any yet this month
153,That's true. Have you seen Friday the 13th? Jason Voorhees terrifies me so much!
153,"yeah, i used to watch the older ones when i was little. i loved jason vs. freddy too"
153,That was my favorite as well!
153,i also like the freddy movies but they used to give me nightmares
153,Yeah they are really scary. I love them. I wish Halloween lasted forever.
154,I wish I could bring him. Maybe I should say he is a comfort dog. I'm just a stocker.
154,"Here is a question.  Since walmart sells everything, do they sell pianos?  I am trying to learn!"
154,"Not full size pianos, no. But we do have keyboards that you can learn on!"
154,I knew they would have some type!  I'll head there after my haircut tomorrow.  I'm getting a buzzcut!
154,"Wow, really? What inspired the buzzcut?"
154,I like my hair short so it is easier to wash and take care of.  No long hair for guys at work as well.
154,"Makes sense. I'm leaving for college in three months, so I'm thinking about a new look."
154,Awesome!  What college are you going to.
154,Fordham University in New York!
154,Nice!  What are you going to study?  I have my degree in accounting.
154,I'm planning to study finance. Gotta make some money!
154,Finance is a great degree.  It is highly marketable and sought after by employers.
155,what would cause you to move around? impatient or some other type of issue
155,"I may have some undiagnosed ADHD or somethin, I'm just a real fidgety person, always have been. But never got any kind of diagnosis"
155,yea a lot of people never get diagnosed for whatever reason.  its never too late to go and get checked.
155,"That's a good idea, I think I have some kinda phobia of docs though so I don't know if I can go through with it. Do you have any phobias?"
155,"im scared of spiders and now that summer is over and its going to get cooler, they will start coming out"
155,"Ick, I get ya there. Their legs are all freaky and long. I find massive ones in my house all the time"
155,"no matter where you go, you can never get away from them.  i just found a black widow hiding in my travel trailer jack last weekend"
155,Ew man a black widow?? I don't have those where I live thankfully. Have you ever found a snake or cockroach anywhere?
155,yeah we feed our bearded dragons dubia roaches.. we have a colony of them!
155,"That's both cool and creepy. Roaches are a no go for me, as bad as spiders but I always think lizards are really cool"
155,they are nice until you have to clean up their mess.  it stinks. but they are nice to look at when they are going after their food.
155,How long do they usually live? Are they nice pets to have?
156,i used to love pink when i was in high school! do you like her newer stuff?
156,Yeah.  It really gives me inspiration when I draw!  Do you dabble in arts?
156,i do some drawing on a digital tablet but I'm definitely an amateur
156,"Thats cool.  It is not for everyone.  My wife can't draw either, but she can sure cook the best pasta!"
156,that's arguably a more important talent to have!
156,I can agree with that!  Are you a good cook?
156,i'm a mediocre cook but i'm always learning new things and trying new recipes
156,What is your favorite type of food?  I love Italian!
156,i love italian too and i'd probably have to go with that. i'm also greek though and i do love greek food
156,I honestly don't think I have ever had greek food!  What are the flavors?
156,"a lot of olives and feta cheese, and yogurt. mediterranean food in general is all pretty much the same."
156,i may have to try that . do you like pink floyd ?
157,"Yeah, he's a really great guy. Do you have any pets?"
157,"No, I don't, the deposit is too expensive but I'd like some. Do you?"
157,two cats and one dog. They are a handful but i love them.
157,"Oh nice, do they get along well with each other?"
157,Kind of. I will go for a run every day and I come home to find the dog hiding and the cats look suspicious though lol.
157,"Oh that sounds kind of fun, haha. How long have you had them?"
157,The cats 5 years and the dog is only 1 year old.
157,"Cool, well I hope you keep enjoying life with them, sounds fun! So where do you live?"
157,Thanks. I live in America. Where do you live?
157,"I live in the US, too actually, on the west coast."
157,I bet it's nice there. I live by the Gulf coast.
157,"Oh I love it down there, you get the coolest storms and sunsets. "
158,i think yoga is a great way to improve your entire life!
158,Yoga is so relaxing.  I actually read a lot of mystery novels too to help me relax!
158,"oh, me too. i have one and i do like to read on it but nothing replaces the feel of a book in my hands."
158,Yeah I hope books on paper never go away.  That's what helps contribute to the experience.
158,i also love being able to have a library. i think books look so nice lined up together
158,Yeah. I wish i had enough money to have my own small library in my house.
158,i love the smell of a nice used book. it gets me in the mood for reading
158,"lol if we're going back to smells, I'll take pizza though."
158,"oh, well that's no good. i guess it's not true what they say: ""any pizza is good pizza"""
158,I meant that it's a good smell.  I love the smell of pizza!
159,would you have a bunch of your own horses there?
159,I would love to have my own there and prob house some other people's as well for extra cash. Have you ever ridden a horse before?
159,i have only ridden a few special occassions
159,It's pretty fun once you build up the skill to do it well. What kind of hobbies do you have?
159,i like to walk my dog around different places and play video games. how about you?
159,"Oh that's neat, what kind of dog have you got? I of course ride horses, but I also like to bake during the night sometimes, it's fun."
159,"our dog is a mutt that we found on the street, so we don't really know her breed"
159,What's her name?  I call my dog Snoopy because I love reading the Peanuts comics  LOL
159,"we named our dog bowie because she has two different color eyes, like david bowie"
159,"Aw that's such a great name, I like Bowie a lot! Do you have any other pets?"
159,"yeah, we have a parrot and a cat too! how about you?"
159,"wow that is a lot of pets ! I've got 3 cats and a dog haha, it's a pretty full house over here too."
160,Oh definitely. Do you like playing games?
160,Totally! Especially retro games. I love my 386. Do you?
160,"I do, I haven't had a chance to play in a long time though."
160,I hope you get some time to play soon. Do you have any animals? I have one cat. Leroy Jenkins. He is vicious.
160,Thanks and no not yet but I hope to get a pet soon. Is your cat nice or sort of solitary?'
160,More solitary. I am afraid to get more cats because of how he reacts to other animals.
160,Oh that's too bad but maybe the right cat could fit in with him some how.
160,Haha hopefully one day. Where are you from?
160,"I am from the west coast, how about you?"
160,I'm from the Gulf coast. It's hot here. How do you like living there?
160,"I like it over here a lot, it's beautiful. I love the coast in the gulf, though as well, the sunsets are so gorgeous."
160,"I guess it is nice to live on the Gulf of Mexico, but then you get all of the hurricanes."
161,"Well, I enjoy eating junk food like candy and soda with my friends while watching a good game1"
161,I like junk food too.  I probably eat too much of it.
161,Don't we all!  What do you like to do for fun?  
161,Mostly spend time with my dogs.  I have four of them. Do you have pets?
161,Thats a lot of dogs!  No pets over here.  My wife and kids are allergic!  I love dogs though.
161,Too bad about being allergic.  How many kids do you have?
161,I have 2 little girls.  They are crazy!  How about you?
161,Two girls is nice.  I don't have kids.  Maybe sometime in the future.  How old are the girls?
161,"9 months and 4 years.  I love them, but they are a handful!  "
161,That is pretty young still.  Any plans for more?
161,No.  Kids are expensive and I don't want to work forever.  I don't think my wife wants to get pregnant again either!
161,I can only imagine the costs.
162,That's really weird.  I'd like to try playing that while singing.
162,"If it seems weird, I also give lessons to show people how to use them."
162,I could get into that.  I used to play guitar but now I just do karaoke on the weekends.
162,I have never done karaoke. Is it fun?
162,"It's cool, I only do it after I've been drinking though, ha!"
162,"I probably would too. With a singing voice like mine, it's probably for the best."
162,I don't know if I could sing sober either.  I just have to be careful to avoid hard cider since I'm allergic to apples.
162,Never heard of anyone allergic to apples
162,"Yeah, me neither, I'm a weirdo.  That's probably why I still eat them even though I'm allergic!"
162,Must not be a severe allergy then. I know someone with an even weirder allergy than that: metal. She can't even hold coins for long without getting a rash.
162,Now that would really be a problem!  At least apples are easy to avoid on a daily basis.
162,The only time I have allergic reactions is during the spring when the plants pollinate. I hate it because the benadryl knocks me out more than anything else could.
163,Do you like beans in your tacos?
163,no i don't like beans
163,same here. i also don't like spaghetti.
163,I love spaghetti myself! I'm not a good cook at all though. I'm always eating out.
163,You're luck! i just graduated high school so i don't get to go eat out as much.
163,"Awe that's sad, at my work, we sell smoothies."
163,what kind of flavors do you sell?
163,Any creamy ones with sweet flavors mostly.
163,Nice! i would like to try sometime maybe.
163,What is your favorite music? Mine is classic rock.
163,I like all sorts of music. classic rock is one of them. 
163,What are your favorite bands of classic rock?
164,That is so interesting. How long did they rule? 
164,I am not sure but I can look it up if you want me to
164,That's okay. My parents are from Japan so they tell me a lot of things about emperors and what not. It's so interesting. 
164,"Oh wow, when did they end up moving here then?"
164,When I was 10. About 20 years ago. Honestly my favorite thing about living here is mcdonalds fries lol.
164,Oh I love fries. I like the Arby's curly fries the best
164,Those are good as well. What's your favorite type of food?
164,I love cheeseburgers but I try not to eat them too much. Don't want to gain too much weight
164,I understand. I have to workout a lot to make sure those fries don't make me gain weight.
164,Makes sense. What do you like to do for fun?
164,I like to read and paint. What do you do for fun?
164,I like to take my puppy to the dog park and watch him run around
165,Oh yeah they are sweet. I love Collies. 
165,The dog I have now is a collie.
165,"Oh cool, what's their name?"
165,Passport kinda weird but I love traveling especially with my family.
165,"Yeah passports are tough, I haven't ever travelled out of the country myself."
165,Oh no that's the name of my dog- passport.
165,"Oh haha oh man I was confused there, but wow that's a fun unique name!"
165,"thanks , i put a lot of thought into that name ."
165,"It's a good one, do they have a nick name?"
165,Sometimes I call her Pass. Only when I'm being lazy.
165,Oh that's kinda cute though. 
165,Do you have a dog?
166,Yes I know she really likes vegan bean dip for one thing. 
166,Interesting! Does this follow her religious beliefs? Some are vegetarians due to their stance on animal rights.
166,"No it's just a diet choice for no reason, although I suspect it helps to lose weight."
166,oh ok . that makes more sense now .
166,"Yeah, it's kind of crazy. Do you eat any special diet yourself?"
166,"I don't eat meat, so a vegetarian. "
166,"Oh cool, do you know of some tasty indulgent vegetarian recipes?"
166,No my mom cooks all my food cause I live in the basement of my parents house.
166,Oh that's nice of her! It must be pretty cozy.
166,"I guess, I don't have to pay rent so that's nice."
166,Yeah you must be very appreciative of that.
166,"I am, helps me pay off the debt I owe."
167,Yeah that's right. Have you ever done it before? I save about 10% more now that I do it
167,Great is the a coupon or a membership discount though?
167,It's coupons. I cut them out of the mailing flyers
167,"I just love saving money, makes me feel good, where do you get those from?"
167,Mainly the flyers that come in the mail but I do print some out on websites also. Just depends on how much time I have
167,"Yep, that's smart, I do that sometimes too, any other ways you know how to save?"
167,I try to mainly buy things when they are on sale. Especially if you can get them buy one get one free
167,Haha that's a smart strategy. What kind of things do you like to buy when they are on sale?
167,I always buy whatever cereal or chips are BOGO. What about you?
167,"Hah, I used to eat Count Chocula cereal. Now I don's spend that much on sweets!"
168,Do you run competitively. I'm in the sports information business. 
168,I run once a year and then eat pastries for the rest of the time.
168,That's my kind of running. I do it so I can have cheesecake and hot wings. 
168,Do you have a favor flavor of cheesecake? I like strawberry and oreo.
168,Those are both good choices.  I like plain old cheesecake and pretty much any of them with real fruit on top. 
168,"Yummy.  How about fresh fruit, I like cookies with fruit jello."
169,I've only traveled within America. But I've been to so many beautiful state parks. I love nature. 
169,Nature is a very good escape.  What state parks. I havent' been to many. I live in Toronto. 
169,Yellowstone or Tennessee state park was my favorite. If you come to America definitely go there. How do you like living there?
169,I like it for the most part. It's not as cold as people think and the people are pretty friendly. 
169,I've always wanted to visit there. I don't really mind cold weather. 
169,Like I said it isn't that cold here. The shopping is good though. 
169,Awesome. I can do some shopping. Especially if I find blue dresses. Anything blue is pretty much my weakness.
169,How about the berry? Perhaps on top of a piece of cheesecake?
169,Haha that's funny. And I actually love cheesecakes.
169,I mean who doesn't? Show me a person that doesn't love cheesecake and I'll show you a person I don't need to hang out with. 
169,True that. Those people cannot be trusted.
169,Agreed.  Food and dogs are where I draw the line. If you don't like them then we're good not knowing one another. 
170,"That doesn't sound exciting, I am retired though so all I do is watch movies."
170,I like to do something worthwhile in my spare time so I volunteer.
170,"Great, what do you volunteer for by the way?"
170,I work with the little kids.
170,Good for you. Where do you live?
170,"I am from the DMV area in the east coast, you?"
170,"I live in central Louisiana, pretty boring here."
170,"Oh I love New Orleans, do you go there a lot?"
170,"Sometimes, just the to the French neighborhood. Why do you like it?"
170,I feel alive when I'm there.
170,"It reminds me of the old western movies, the building are so old there."
170,"Hmmm. I've never felt that way before, interesting take on it."
171,"At least you can get a job, nobody wants to hire me with my condition."
171,Oh I'm so sorry. What is your condition?
171,"Doctors said I have Autism, although Im just quiet that's all."
171,Even if you do have that I don't understand why no one would hire you. That doesn't seem fair
171,Well it's hared to find a good paying job where you don't interact with anyone anyway. So I'll just live of the benefits.
171,Well I'm glad that you are able to receive benefits. Do you like to travel?
171,"Yes, traveling is fun, it's like a new religion these days. And you?"
171,Yeah I travel all over because of my job. I could get you a free flight some time if you'd like
171,That would be nice. What's your job by the way?
171,I'm an airline pilot. 
171,Well that makes sense. Where did you fly most recently? 
171,Right now I'm in Indianapolis. Headed to Alaska in the morning. Where are you located?
172,Oh makes sense. But anyway what other hobbies do you have?
172,I have a dog and we go for long walks.
172,"That could be fun, I just do morning runs 6 days a week."
172,That's awesome! Sometimes my dog tries to run but I don't like to.
172,"You should try it, running give you a lot of energy. It's like dancing."
172,I feel like planting flowers in my garden is good for my health.
172,What makes you think this way?
172,You help the environment and improve your health.
172,With flowers? Or do you use them for tea?
172,"I like the wildflowers, I plant them and then just let them grow, no weeding involved!"
172,"That's smart, but do they look nice?"
172,"They do, we don't mow our yard so it's just all over. The neighbors don't like them for some reason though."
173,I like nature anyway so I don't mind getting a used car.
173,"That's cool, you should think about getting a 4 wheel drive."
173,"Yeah, that way I can travel through rugged terrain. Do you like animals?"
173,Yeah....animals are awesome....you?
173,"Yes, I even enjoy looking at wildlife."
173,That's great....with a 4 whell you will be able to travel all over the place....and bring your dog! Do you have animals?
173,"Yes, I have a dog and a cat."
173,"We don't have any pets, but with two kids....a dog is in our future."
174,I like pizza. 
174,I love pizza. I thought about driving pizza delivery but I need to get a license.
174,Do you own a car?
174,I do. I co-own two cars with my wife but I only have a permit to drive.
174,Are they automatic or stick?
174,One is an automatic and the other is stick. I can drive the truck (automatic) no problem but the wagon is manual.
174,"I love use stick shift on cars, my dad taught me when I was just a kid. "
174,I still need to learn manual. Do you like art?
174,Yes. Especially sculpture. And you?
174,Sure do. I used to live on the east coast and would love to go to the DC museums. I like to draw but I'm not very good. Favorite artist?
174,I like Da Vinci because he is so precise and inventive.
174,Nice. I appreciate a bit of Da Vinci. He was a true renaissance  man.
175,I love pineapple on pizza! 
175,"I like pineapple on pizza too. My favorite pizza is chicken, tomato, and jalapeno."
175,That sounds good too! My cat always bugs me for the toppings. 
175,Mine does too. She loves chicken. She always tries to steal it whenever I make it
175,Same here. They are chaotic but lovable! 
175,Mine is really loving for a cat. She loves to sit on my lap and be petted
175,Mine will paw at my feet and crawl all over! 
175,Aww that's so cute. What do you do for a living?
175,"I work with metal, helping construction projects! You?  "
175,That's really cool! I just wait tables while trying to get through school
175,Thank you! What are you going to school for?
175,Criminology. I'm hoping to get my doctorate and become a professor
175,That's really awesome! 
176,"Sorry to hear that. I live near a beach, so there are lots of touristy pizza places in walking distance."
176,I wish I lived near the beach. The beach is my favorite place to relax and catch up on some books. 
176,It honestly gets old getting sand in the book spines lol. I usually just sit by a window to enjoy the view when I read.
176,I know what you mean! The sand can get every where which is why I switched to an e-reader when I do read at the beach. 
176,"That's a really good idea, I should look into one of those! Any particular one you like to use?"
176,"I recommend the Kindle, it is most like reading a book - it does not have the glare that hurts your eyes like a tablet can have from the sun."
176,Is your model waterproof or do you just sit away from the water? I'd be worried about ocean spray messing it up.
176,"Mine is not water proof, I usually sit a little distance away from the water. I did not know there was a waterproof model. "
176,"I don't know if there is either lol, just curious if you knew of one that is."
176,"I will have to look up if there is one, if there is not, you have a million dollar idea! lol"
176,Haha sounds like it! I'll split the earnings with you lol
176,Haha I like the sound of that! Looks like I will be able to move to the beach after all! 
177,What else do you like to do with your free time?
177,I don't really have a lot of free time. My job keeps me busy. 
177,REally. What do you do?
177,I'm a janitor. It's exhausting but also rewarding. What do you do?
177,"I work at a movie theater, mainly because I love watching movies."
177,Nice! What is your favorite movie? I haven't been able to watch a lot of movies lately because I can't find my contacts.
178,It's a chest that's used as a cooler you just put ice in it.
178,gotcha
178,Do you have any hobbies?
178,Naw. Drink and play Xbox mostly - and I do like makeup
178,Are you the only child in your family?
178,"Nope, I have one sister - and I have a better smile than she does!"
178,"Than you hobbie makes sense, I have 4 sibling, so I have many hobbies."
178,"cool , didn't ask ! do you like trucks ?"
178,"I do, or do you mean like big trucks?"
178,"I've never driven a truck, only small vehicles! How's that working out for you?"
178,What exactly?
178,"Just a large truck. We have a lot of commerical trucks around here, those are some big trucks."
179,Oh I can do way better than Red Lobster!
179,Like what?
179,Grilled shrimp on a charcoal grill glazed with garlic butter is amazing.
179,That's sounds tasty.
179,I wish I could get fresh shrimp but I'm afraid of wide open areas like the ocean
179,Oh I love seafood though. It's worth it I'd say lol.
179,I do too - I really need to try!
179,you should .maybe we could somehow try it toghether?
179,Well that sounds like a plan
179,Do you like shopping anyway?
180,Never met them?
180,I mean recently. sorry.
180,Have you tried to reach out to them?
180,I have. They pretty much went no contact. They don't care I guess.
180,"I have two younger brothers, I'm the oldest. I don't see them too much these days."
180,Why not? I don't have time for example because of my strange job.
180,"I'm very busy with work and school, plus they are reaching their adolescence. They want to spread their wings and venture off more. "
180,So you have a big difference in age than?
180,Yes the second oldest is ten years younger than me.
180,"Wow, how was it growing up in such a family?"
180,"Pretty normal, like any other family I suppose. Do you think your family is normal?"
180,i guess so . i don t worry about what is considered normal .
181,Oh I'm sorry. Which limb?
181,"My left arm - but it's ok, i've learned to be the clown to cover up for it."
181,"Wow, that's interesting, very good og you to stay positive"
181,"Thanks, there were many legal, financial, social etc issues that I have overcome now"
181,Where do you work now by the way? 
181,"I just sent my last job! im a digital artist, so an essential part of my work is technology!"
181,Well I work on the opposite side haha. I work at an old museum of technology.
181,What exactly would that be?
181,"It's museum that displays history of technological progress, like from button phones to touchscreens. "
181,"O awesome, so its more of a general public museums and not one of the niche ones more meant for researchers?"
181,"No, it unique and fun, or it could be the first few times."
181,The traditional model of museums is changing in the digital age!
182,are you into music?
182,"I used to be. I haven't listened to The Strokes in a while, though. Are they still together?"
182,I think so - it's been awhile since I've listened to them as well - I like to read books now
182,"Sorry, I thought you asked if I was into THEIR music. Yes, I LOVE music. I love reading, too. Stephen King is my favorite author. Who's yours? "
182,"I love Harlan Coben actually, but also really into Lincoln and Child"
182,What about bands? I love a lot of indie bands from the early 2000's. It's mostly ear garbage now.
182,Yeah not much into them as I used to be.
182,"Well, I have a bit of a temper. Music helps calm me down."
182,I agree - music soothes the savage beast so they say
182,"It's true. We need more positive music, like the music from the 80's. Instead, we have mumble rap, and teen crap."
182,I agree - today's music is junk for the most part - and with horrible language
182,"There's great music out there. Look up Manchester Orchestra's A Black Mile To The Surface album on YouTube. They're an indie band, and that entire album is amazing!"
183,Really? Where do you work this days?
183,I work at the bank
183,Don't banks have good work-life balance schedules? 
184,Thank you!  It was hard but now I can finally get my feet moving forward.
184,Good luck! Once you're done with university work I'm sure that a lot of time will help you out!
184,"Thank you!  That's what I'm hoping for, more free time to work on the things I want to do."
184,"I know, the free time is the best. You can do whatever you want, whenever!"
184,"Exactly!  School was great and all, but knowing I had that time to myself to work on my passions was so great."
184,i am happy for you ! what else do you enjoy ?
184,"That's very kind of you.  Music, art, theatre, those are huge passions of mine.  What about yourself?"
184,"Yes! I like to paint and listen to it, it calms me. An artist named Enya makes great new age music!"
184,"I love Enya, she has some wonderful relaxing music.  Definitely my kind of music!"
184,I agree.  For relaxation she's great.  The way she overlays her vocals is amazing.  Do you listen only when stressed?
184,"I'll listen to her or music like that in general, soft music like that is great no matter your mood."
184,We need more musicians who are about the music and bringing enlightenment to people. We got way too much commercial garbage on the radio.
185,i have a son he keeps me busy
185,I am sure he can also count on you for everything
185,yes its really hard sometimes
185,I can imagine so - do you have any hobbies?
185, yes I love to make crafts hbu
185,crafting is great fun i'm sure . . . do your kids participate ?
185,yes we have so much fun. Do u want kida?
185,yea sure
185,thats great they are great fun
185,"They are, I love working with children too!"
185,me to its been good talking to u
185,"you too , thank you for the amazing conversation !"
186,I try to but I do schedule breaks so I don't burn out. What do you do for exercise?
186,I help my dad with work somtimes that's my exercise.
186,Oh that's cool. What does your dad do?
186,"He works at ups, so I help him load heavy boxes sometimes. "
186,Oh that is good exercise. Do you have a job too then?
186,"No but if am am to get one, it has to be as far from science as possible. "
186,Oh you don't like science? I love it. I majored in Zoology
186,Is that even science?
186,Yeah it's the study of animals. The school I went to split biology into plants and animals
186,Why do you like it. the science is so hard.
186,I've always just liked it and found it easy. And I love animals. I always thought English classes were the hardest
186,English is easy to me. You must be smart to like science. 
187,"I like the digital artists more, like the ones that make video games. "
187,I love to paint myself.
187,Do you paint with oil? 
187,Yes. I like paints from a water based solution.
187,Are you good or just leaning? 
187,"i'm not sure , the paint is still drying ."
187,What is the painting about? 
187,It was a painting of a waterfall. It is really beautiful
187,I really would like to see it. 
187,"its amazing and such a joy to paint , i am an artist and love my brush ."
188,I think I'd like to have a grocery store that sells only pizza!
188,Pizza? You mean like the Papa Murphy's store? 
188,"Well, maybe, but I'd prefer if it was cooked first, I never understood the point of buying uncooked pizza."
188,Well then you just want to open a restaurant. I want a real grocery store. 
188,"Well I think the main color in my restaurant should be red, that's a really nice color."
188,Why red? don't you think it's too bright?
188,Well my true favorite color is red but I think that might only be because it is part of purple
188,Purple is much more suiting for a restaurant I think.
188,"Yeah, purple is a very elegant color.  I'm used to elegance since I'm a spoiled only child."
188,"But any ways I almost forgot to say, I can't really see colors, I just know based on descriptions. "
188,"Well, let me describe red for you... it is like a passionate kiss with the knowledge you will never have that feeling again."
188,"I like red color than, although not sure if pizza is a good companion for that. "
189,I am good as well.  I have not seen that movie.
189,It's like the Steve Jobs of movies. Hah. So what singers do you like?
189,I listen to a lot of music.  Recently I have been listening to older Bob Dylan.  What about you?
189,Bob Dylan is great! I love Mr. Tambourine Man. His voice is really unique.
189,What else do you like to do for fun?
189,I play video games. I like Ultima online especially. What about you? Do you play?
189,I am not much of a gamer.  I prefer to get outside and go for a hike.
189,"Don't get me wrong, I like the outdoors too. Scotland is gorgeous for hiking."
189,I would love to go to Scotland.  So much to see.  Do you travel?
189,I do. I'm a singer so I tour a lot. 
189,"That sounds great.  Do you enjoy touring, or is it good to get off the road?"
189,"It can be hectic, but i meet so many wonderful people in the community. I sing folk mostly. "
190,setting goals and completing them
190,Amazing! I'm so proud of you for your dedication!
190,"Thanks its just the beginning, i  am already setting my next goals."
190,what kind of goals are you setting?
190,i look at it like a marathon and not a sprint.  I try to lose at least 2 pounds a week 
190,That seems like it would be a lot of work.
190,"IT is but being in sports all my life, i find the challenge very exciting.  I consider my self a very competitive person."
191,Is time really an issue for getting tatoos?
191,"Yes, sometimes they more than 2 sessions "
191,And how long is a session?
191,It is about 2 hours per session
191,I've thought about getting a tatoo but the needle scares me haha
191,"it did hurt very much , like 1000 needles"
191,saying 1000 needles isn't very assuring lol
191,I like the pain because it makes me feel alive! What do you like to do for fun?
191,I've been playing a lot of golf lately
191,Cool I have always wanted to try gold!
191,It's nice and relaxing. But starting out it's a bit frustrating not being able to hit the ball
191,Practice makes perfect!
192,yes i love to keep to look back at memories.
192,"That is great, make sure you pass it on to your kids as well!"
192,Absolutely I have parties to look back on too
192,Excellent!I love parties
192,oh my gosh so do I
192,what is your favorite party ?
192,I am not sure probably new years 
192,Nice! New years is one of my favorites. 
192,yes halloween is the best too
192,Yes! So much candy! And it is also coming up. Any costume ideas?
192,no not really
192,Well alright then. It was nice talking to you!
193,Well i love rollercoasters because of the physics involved
193,Me too. It gives me life to feel like falling
193,Do you like feeling outside yourself?
193,I love going outside and taking a walk
193,"All the trees and flowers, nature can be so perfect"
193,I agree. It is the fall season and the trees will be lots of different colors and pretty!
193,Theres a lot in nature that can be used for science. Do you like to read?
193,Not really. I fall asleep while reading. I prefer to watch something
193,"My friends think I am a nerd for reading so much, but i find it relaxing. What have you watched recently?"
193,I have recently been watching Game of Thrones because I have never seen it before
193,"I really enjoyed it, the last season got weird though."
193,I am still near the beginning unfortunately!
194,I like mystery flavored desserts and cakes. How about you?
194,i like mystery flavors especially when they are in a cake .
194,What is your favorite thing to ear?
194,Gooey butter cake. It's rich and sweet.
194,Sounds tasty. I like junk food like fried chicken and hamburger 
194,I have been wanting to try Korean fried chicken. It's fried twice and so it is crunchier and less greasy.
194,I have watched many videos of korean fried chicken on Youtube. It looks great!
194,"I'm also curious about Taiwanese fried chicken, it is referred to as popcorn chicken, I think because it is in bite-sized pieces."
194,I wish I could eat more Asian food but I live in the middle of nowhere!
194,That can be pretty lame. Maybe you can move closer to a city soon where they have better ethnic restaurants.
194,Do you live in a multicultural city?
194,"My city is growing with a more diverse population, mainly Latinos but a newer population of middle easterners are arriving."
195,"No, because it wouldn't be safe for her."
195,"Wouldn't it be safe with the inflatable safety gear, though?"
195,Why do they have so many locations?
195,I'm not sure. But I know the natural buoyancy of the human body helps!
195,So she won't need inflatables?
195,"She will definitely need inflatables! I'm sure she will be ok with them, though."
196,"I don't know yet, I haven't tried it yet.  Do you like it?"
196,Yes they taste like giant shrimps!
196,That sounds good.  I am looking forward to it.  What else do you like to eat?
196,My dog likes eating turkey slices and me too
196,What breed is your dog?
196,I have a German Shepherd! It is big and friendly
196,I have a Poodle.  It is big too.  Do you have a yard?
196,Yes I have a big yard. I like to put my toy train collection outside too. I like trains and reading about them
196,I own a home with a smaller yard.  How many trains do you own?
196,I have over 20 large trains! 
196,That is a lot.  Good thing for the big yard
196,Yes. My kids love playing outside
197,"Ok, you seem so sure. Do you have experience with this stuff?"
197,I order a lot of delivery pizza but I did work at a Pizza Hut for two years.
198,"Spaghetti is okay, but I don't know why it's the go to pasta dish. There are way better ones."
198,Spaghetti in Italy used to be alot longer but Americans made it shorter to make it easier to eat
198,That makes sense. Probably easier to package dried pasta too since we don't make it fresh.
198,"Yeah, and I also know that Spaghetti is a staple food in Italy"
198,"I'd like to visit spaghetti and try the real thing. Not, like, whatever I make that's just dried noodles and nasty premade sauce lol"
198,Spaghetti all puttanesca literally means the spaghetti of the whore lol
198,Oh wow. I wonder why?
198,I'm not even sure
198,"Well, I'd take a well made pasta dish in place of money if I were in...that line of work. So it fits well enough"
198,sounds like a good diea
198,As a woman I can verify we love good cooking lol
198,I love good cooking too!
199,yes
199,I wish my family was that supportive.  Any decision I make is met with hostility from them.
199,that is wonderful to hear. really you are blessed
199,I think you misunderstood what I was saying.  But that's alright.  How do you like the work you do?
199,i understood what you exactly meant.
199,I don't believe you did.  I said my family is very hostile and you said I was blessed to have them.
199,they are helping when you are in need. so i said that you are blessed with wonderful family.
199,"Your family was the one that was helpful, mine was not."
199,"yes, i have got a wonderful supportive family where we share our problems and solve within us."
199,"That's quite wonderful to hear, you definitely are very lucky to have such a family."
199,"yes, thanks. Are you living in a joint family or separate ?"
199,"Separate right now, it's easier to have a stronger relationship with my family this way."
200,"I can always help myself, that's very important, then I can help others after helping myself."
200,"Do you feel that helping others should be equally important to helping yourself, though? "
200,That depends on the person.  Some people help others more than they help themselves and some people don't help others at all.
200,That is true but at the same time should help really be given on that basis? We should not just help others because we might get help in return. 
200,Oh I didn't mean it with the hope of getting something in return.  Just that you can help for the sake of helping to all sorts of degrees.
200,"True. For example, I love to read books and when I've finished reading I donate them to a local charity shop. "
200,And you have no regrets about doing that?  Like potentially rereading those books someday?
200,No - though I admit that my very favourite books I do keep. But giving books away is an idiosyncracy of mine - like scratching my nose for fun!
200,"That's very generous of you, I'm definitely not that kind.  I do love animals though, maybe I should volunteer."
200,I own rescue animals myself - it's a wonderful thing to do 
200,That's great!  All kinds of animals or specific ones?
200,I have three rescue cats and one dog. 
200,That's quite a few animals.  Are you happy with that amount or would you get more to care for more?
201,Oh I see. Do you ever have thoughts about switching jobs?
201,"I do, I think up what sorts of jobs I'd enjoy and figure out how I can make it happen."
201,"Well, I'd recommend talking to your employer and maybe see if you can get a raise. If not, try searching for other jobs."
201,"That is definitely a good idea.  I do enjoy the work I do, so if I can get a salary increase that would be very beneficial."
201,Yes! The more money the better. Good luck with that!
201,Thank you!  Though with more money is typically more responsibility and I value my free time.
201,"That is true. I value my free time as well, but hey, what harm can more money do. Right?"
201,"I'm not sure, I've never had more money to know what to do with it haha!"
201,Haha! Awesome response. Well It was nice talking to you!
201,"You as well, have yourself a wonderful day!"
201,Likewise!
201,Thank you!
202,Did you have any damage to your house?
202,"No, just a few trees fell in the front yard. Thank goodness. Our dogs were pretty scared though."
202,how many dogs do you have?
202,"I have three dogs, two little ones and a small one,do you have any?"
203,"yeah ive actually had the opportunity to catch up on some episodes, as i recently starting working online from home."
203,"Cool show, but I'm way behind on it. Going to have to schedule a binge watching session soon!"
203,"Yes definitely is, i have never been much of a binge watcher, but i foresee my self becoming one being at home."
204,"Wow, they've lived long lives! I've bet they've got a lot of stories to tell"
204,"Yes, they've lived full lives and have made great memories. I actually take after my father, we're both short at just 5 ft lol"
204,Lol nothing wrong with being short. It came in handy for me while growing up on a farm
204,I probably look like I grew up on a farm with my full beard
204,"Perhaps, although I noticed the beards were in with the hipsters when I moved across the country at 18. It was quite funny lol"
204,"Yeah, I'm surprised that trend is still strong. They now have full barber shops with a focus on beard styling"
204,"And a whole array of products! It's like makeup, but for beards. They seem to work nicely, though."
204,"Yeah, my girlfriend gifted me a beard oil set last Christmas. "
204,"That's so sweet! I almost got my boyfriend one of those, but since he loves incense, I got him one of those cool fountain incense things."
204,Some beard oils have added extracts and essential oils. I think you may find one that he'll love. I wanted one of those fountains!
204,I'll have to do my research. And you should definitely get one! The holidays are coming up so maybe you can ask for one as a gift!
204,"Yeah, I definitely need to get everyone's holiday list going as well. "
204,"Me too! Actually, I'd better get on that now, so talk to you later!"
205,"Yeah australia is amazing in its own way, very nature based country!"
205,yep nature is pretty awesome . the complexity of everything can humble a person .
205,"Truly! I was of thinking of diversity and complexity when I made that decision, glad I finally got my mind to agree on something!"
205,"If I went to Australia, I think I'd visit Canberra or Sydney"
205,"You should go to Melbourne, they held UFC 243 there, last weekend!"
205,I love the big ppv events! It's hard to believe that UFC has hosted over 400 events since it inception!
205,Thats true! I love seeing there growth over time and how they have grown as a company with names such as conor mcgregor!
205,"Hes still pretty young, I love McGregor he is actually 2nd on the UFC's pound for pound rankings."
205,"No he's not, Khabib Nurmagomedov holds that spot. "
205,Oh I didn't know about that. He is the Ultimate Fighting Championship lightweight champion.
205,"No he's not, the current champion is Khabib Nurmagomedov do you still watch ufc to this day?"
205,I don't. Lost touch with it and watch other sports more.
206,I love cats.  I black black cats especially.
206,same but i love cats dogs everything
206,Me too.  If it wasn't for pets life would sure be lonely.
206,yep.. i do not have any kids but i love this cat as my kid. and i know i cannot live without her
206,"i have a wife and kids but let me tell you a secret between us, I think I like these cats even more!"
206,Well thats cute. actually 2 days before my cat had a very high fever. and i was scared man.
206,Yeah my cat had a kidney stone or something last week.  We got her antibiotics but I think she passed the stone because she had blood in her urine.
206,That kind of sad really. You may also want to get your blood  pressure checked. Cat lovers are more likely to have higher blood pressure.
206,"is that really true?  I think they help with the blood pressure, but yeah I have anxiety."
206,i think they might be right . you ever went to a therapist or doctor ? actually i am very possessive about cat so i am very careful.
206,I haven't seen a doctor for years.  My wife takes the kids in but I feel healthier without one.
206,That's a relief! Your wife is a lucky lady. bless you all
207,It's a mexican restuarant with the best tacos
207,do you like mexican food
207,"I didn't at first, but moving here there's only mexican food, so you get used to it"
207,"mexican food is delicious , i like mexican food more than dominican food."
207,never tried dominican food. what's it like?
207,its real spicy but if you like spicy food than you will probably like it
207,Oooo. I love spicy food. 
207,cool. then you should try some 
207,I'll def have to check it out. 
207,if you like spicy food you should eat some indian food.
207,"love indian food, curry, naan, etc"
207,nice but indian food is too spicy for me. it will have my stomach hurting.
208,I did not know that.  Are you a dancer?
208,"yes, I'm a guitar player too."
208,What type of music do you play?
208,Music. Some of the hardest music that professionals play.
208,I don't know much about what is hard to play.
208,Do you like music?
208,I like all music including opera music.
208,Do you play any instruments?
208,I used to play piano.
208,The piano is cool. Have you heard of pianist Bruce Hornsby?
208,"I have, do you like his music?"
208,"Yes, he was one of the best musicians ever."
209,Me too! I am gonna bring a portable CD player  so we can watch Scooby Doo - best show ever!
209,We should probably enjoy nature even though I enjoy scooby doo.
209,We can do both .. I am not really used to nature - my job is as a doorperson at a punkrock club
209,"I am not used to it either but I am up to trying something new. Maybe we should bring some drinks too, since I am feeling so brave."
209,Drinks sound very good. In my job I can't drink whilst working but after the club closes I always have a Bloody Mary. 
209,"Sounds icky, I have never drank anything before so I will need your guidance."
209,It's vodka with tomato juice and a dash of tabasco. Lovely stuff. 
209,Maybe I will try that.
209,You will love it. You must come to the club I work for one time!
209,"That sounds fun. Thanks for the invitation, I'll bring Lisa, we have been dating for such a long time and we have never been to a club."
209,My fiance pops in sometimes but as I am working I obviously can't talk to him on the job 
209,Too bad. But at least you get to see him.
210,"That's pretty cool, I should read up on more of that!"
210,"You should, it is worth a look!"
210,Reading usually is!  Any other sports you're into besides basketball?
210,"I'm more into Soccer, basketball and Football those are my favorite major professional sports."
211,I agree
211,why did you do that crime?. you are turned out to be a social evil.
211,"I must've not like them, plus the pigs were hungry"
211,whatever the problem you should speak and solve it. And you should not say that the pigs are hungry as this is disgusting.
211,You think a murderer cares if something is disgusting?
211,"No, but the murderer is a human first and then he is turning out to be a evil in bad situation."
211,I think that good and evil are subjective and ultimately human constructions that don't exist
211,if you are reading a lot of books with good proverb you could have solved any situation with positive way.
211,what books do you recommend?
211,"The Alchemist, Think and Grow Rich and The Magic. There are so many books that can change you mindset and take you to the right path."
211,i'm familiar with think and grow rich. great book
211,"yes, that teaches you how to live the life happily and gives you positive. I always read a lot of books which gives me good thoughts about life."
212,"Nice, working on a farm seems fun. "
212,"I agree, I love farms because it feels so natural."
212,"Yes! Farms are outdoors, so it is as natural as it can get."
212,yes. I love the outdoors.
212,"Same here. What is your favorite? Beaches, farms, or the urban life?"
212,"of course, farm! I have been living at a farm since I was young"
212,I see I see. What type of farm is it? Like what type of animals do you have there?
212,"we have chickens,bulls and cows"
212,Oh wow nice. That farm seems pretty legitimate!
212,Yes it is :)
212,Sounds great. My grandfather actually owns his own farm with horses and chickens in it. I love going there!
212,"That is really cool, and you probably get the freshest eggs too! Chickens are great."
212,"Yes chickens are great. Well, it was nice talking to you!"
213,"I was just kidding about stealing, but money is kind of tight right now. I'm watching a horror movie right now - I love being scared."
213,Wow! So close to bedtime? That's impressive. What is it about?
213,It's The Ring - have you ever seen it?  I haven't seen it in years. Man is this creepy!
213,"I think I saw that when I was a child. My partner has been trying to get me to watch it again, but I know I'll have nightmares."
213,You are right - shouldn't watch so close to bedtime. Do you play any instruments?
213,"I can't play any instruments now, but I've always wanted to learn the piano."
213,"I've started back with playing violin. Played as a kid, then didn't for many years. Now trying to get back into it."
213,How long did you play as a kid?
213,"From like age 8 until about 14. Then in high school, I got into other things."
214,what do you do for a living?
214,"Nothing interesting. Just a boring office job. Kinda just go in and cash out sort of deal, you know?"
214,"yeah, i've done that. not now, though, i freelance so i work from home."
214,That sounds interesting. Does it save you a lot of time for hobbies and relaxation?
214,"eh, somewhat. i'm not super social though. i'd rather stay home and be online. are you a big social media person?"
214,"I like to browse reddit and stuff occasionally, if that counts as social media."
214,"i think so. i usually just scan twitter and look for funny stuff. i follow lots of people, celebrities mostly"
214,"Ah. Yeah I scan twitter occasionally, too. I don't see the appeal of interacting with folks I know irl tho"
214,"i probably have more ""friends"" online than irl. i don't really do well in face-to-face situations."
214,I think it's easier to find people with your exact interests through the internet.
214,"that's true, especially for dating. much easier to sort through online profiles than try to talk to people at a bar or whatever"
214,I'd be kinda scared to meet up w/ someone irl
214,"as long as it's in a public place with lots of people around, it's pretty low-risk"
215,"I didn't say anything, just walked away."
215,"That sounds like an alright response, that was pretty rude of her to say that in front of everyone."
215,"Yeah, I felt really bad."
215,You shouldn't!  You're definitely not in the wrong there!
215,I don't understand why somebody would that to another person. I mean I know I am a little strange but I didn't deserve it.
215,"Nobody deserves that, tact is a thing that she definitely was lacking.  That's what kids do, not adults."
215,It has been nice talking to you. It is making me feel better.
215,"I'm glad to hear that!  We should hang out sometime soon, it would be fun!"
215,Yeah that would be great. How are things with you?
215,"Things are going alright, dating scene for me is a bit rough, but I did go see some movies by myself and that was a blast."
215,We should go together sometime. I can try to be your wingman.
215,"That would be a great idea, we should definitely do that.  Are you free on Friday?"
215,"Yes, lets meet."
216,I'm not sure. Maybe it's the weather
216,There is crazy weather now.  Is it cold where you are?
216,No it's quite hot still actually haha. but i will be moving soon to a colder climate
216,Are you excited to move?
216,"No not really, just for work"
216,Maybe the move will be good for your mood.
216,Well I don't want to leave my nice island life haha
216,That sounds nice.  I hate wide open spaces.
216,Well when i'm out at sea fishing it's nothing but wide open space
216,That is not what I would be looking for.  Is that your job?
216,"Yes, I love it. Fish tuna"
216,I am a writer.  I mostly stay off the water.
217,"I am! I was so nervous to go to the dentist, do they make you nervous?"
217,"doesn't seem like  anyone really enjoys going to the dentist, lol..."
217,You are very correct on that one.  But it is a necessary evil.  Did you enjoy your day today?
217,"That it is, Actually today was a very enjoyable day, i was just in mood and i blasted my metal music at home."
217,"That's good that you found some ""you"" time.  I like to do crazy things to my appearance when I get in a mood."
217,"yea , wanted to experience all the excitement, its helps me keep me sane "
217,Of metal music?
217,"Yes metal music puts me in a different zone, people say it opens my third eye as i like psychoanalyzing my friends at times. "
217, I see.  Do you play too?
217,"NO, i just push play and let the app stream, maybe one day ill have the time learn an instrument. "
217,Im sure you would do great at it if you tried.  What instrument interest you?
217,"the drums no doubt, for some reason ive had dreams about being one that analyzes dreams, i take it as sign. "
218,Yeah. Miami is full of them!
218,the traffic and those idiots on the road just very frustrating ! some should not be driving !
218,"Most certainly! I agree, I have no idea how some people passed their driving test!"
218,Yeah I don't know either.
218,"Well, that's life for ya! haha"
218,"Without a doubt, most drivers are total morons."
218,I agree. From the speeders to the rude people.
218,I agree. I have only seen them on the neighborhood roads - hopefully engineers at least allowed for at least 5mph over the speed limit.
218,In the neighborhood roads?! That is so dangerous on their part!
218,Yes glad someone can relate. A lot of crazy drivers down here in Texas haha
218,"Oh my. I feel for that though, Florida is full of them!"
218,So true.  I know my city is growing by the minute.  Traffic is horrific!!!
218,Ahhh I don't even want to talk about traffic!
219,"mmmm. I'm also a fan of their ice cream, if the machine is every working haha"
219,"I can get a free cone on my breaks! The money stinks, but I'm saving up to buy my first car."
219,"That's good, what's your budget?"
219,"I try to spend $800 per month or less, and save the rest."
219,"Nice, you should check out this app called YNAB. love it"
219,What does that do? I'll let you tell me - I'm too lazy to google it!
219,It's a budgeting app with a big following. Helps you keep track of your money
220,"Haha, she's probably buried in a grave"
220,I've read some of her poetry. She was a pretty sad person.
220,What struck you as sad?
220,She was just a lonely person. She was a hermit who lived alone. It reflects in her writing. 
220,Do you think there is beauty in the sadness of her poetry?
220,"I do see beauty in it, but I wonder what beautiful things she could have achieved if she'd gotten the help she needed."
220,"Perhaps she wouldn't be famous then, if her predicament were different"
220,"You might be right. Do you do anything creative, yourself?"
220,"Not really, wbu?"
220,"I draw and write occasionally, but I'm not particularly skilled at either. It's more hobbyist than anything serious."
220,"I tried picking up digital drawing, but i quit after being so bad"
220,"It takes a lot of practice, but not everyone wants to go through the learning process and that's okay! Do what you think is fun."
221,I did not know that.  Do you like animals?
221,"Somewhat, I like to read all the placards at the zoo"
221,I love animals.  Especially my dog.
221,What kind of dog is it?
221,German Shepard.  Do you have any pets?
221,"No pets, but I do wish I had a zebra"
221,A zebra would be an awesome pet.
221,"Agreed, that would be badass. Riding it around town haha"
221,Do you have a family?
221,"I live long distance from my fiancee, we're looking to close the gap soon though"
221,Maybe a zebra for the wedding
221,Hahaha. Well no one but the bride can wear white... so I'll paint it all black
222,I really want to move out though. She doesn't want me to.
222,Just tell her that she can end up damaging her brain or liver.
222,By being around me? LOL you're hilarious.
222,I'm only kidding lol
222,I know! I have a good sense of humor. My dad does too. I miss him a lot.
222,oh thats great to hear. i would love to say jokes while i travel. i usually travel a lot to reduce my stress
222,I bet that's incredible. Where do you like to travel?
222,all over so i can take pictures and hike . maybe somewhere in europe to hike the alps
222,I wish my mom would let me go. I'd even join you.
222,Haha.  You can come with us!! it would be really fun
222,Who do you usually travel with?
222,Idk ourselves maybe? lol :D
223,Are you a fan of pecan pie?  
223,I do like pecan pie.  Do you?
223,"Yes, it's my favorite!  I always make a lot of pecan pie around thanksgiving since my family loves it so much!"
223,It is always at our Thanksgiving as well.  Are you a good cook?
223,"Not so much a good cook, but baking is definitely my forte.  I'm not sure why, I've just always excelled more with baking."
223,Do you enjoy it?  I've considered starting a bakery.
223,"I really do!  It's a huge passion of mine!  I didn't know you were considering that, that's amazing!"
223,I really need any job right now.  I think I might just take a leap of faith and try it.
223,That's gonna be a huge leap of faith.  Are you sure you're ready for it?
223,I hope so.  Have you ever run a business?
223,"I've done a little bit of managerial work, but nothing like starting my own.  That is something I want to do someday though."
223,I know a couple people with small businesses.  
224,"Well I just lost my job, so I think maybe I really am looking for a cheap flat!  Ha!"
224,"Oh, wow... I am so sorry to hear it. Are you doing alright? My apartment is smallish, but you can stay here if you need to.."
224,"Well thanks for the offer but I'm too proud to accept, I'll be okay, thanks though!"
224,"Any time. And if you should change your mind or find the need, the offer stands."
224,Well I might consider it actually.  I like to stay up all hours of the night but I just ordered some headphones so that might not bother you...
224,"Dude, I'm an incurable insomniac, so it wouldn't bother me at all. It's too quiet around here sometimes now that I am sober (mostly!) ;)"
224,"HA!  I went sober for a month last May, and it really helped me out, by teaching me to appreciate my beers even more, which I'm doing right now!!!"
224,Cheers! Come on over & let's get sh*tfaced to celebrate your liberation from the man!! :)
224,I think we can get along marvelously!  As long as you don't mind me being a redhead that is!
224,Redheads are cool with blonde girls!! Let's do this!
224,My gal!  We will be the most fantastic of roommates!
224,Sounds like a winner to me! I'll get some space set up for you muy pronto.
225,That's quite interesting. So they have functioning plumbing and kitchens too?
225,"Yep, there is a series of pipes, valves, plumbing fixtures under the deck that leads into a tanks to contain the fluids."
225,"Fascinating. I wonder how the reception is. I eat out more than three times a week, so I'd love to be able to order something while out on the water"
225,Haha unfortunately no eating out. but the fish out at sea can be tasty.
225,"Oooh, I've only fished once. I'd love to learn how to do it properly."
225,"You should, it's nice and relaxing. Maybe go with someone and have a nice conversation"
225,"I'll make a plan to do that. I actually look down on people who don't eat out as often as I do, but I'm thinking I need to reevaluate that."
225,No problem in cooking at home. I do it. I only eat out for occassions
225,I grew up eating out a lot and was taught that being domestic is out of fashion. I may have missed out on some serious life lessons and skills lol
225,Ah well try getting a cookbook.
225,Do you have any suggestions?
225,"How to cook everything is a good one, but might be too detailed haha"
225,"I'll at least give it a try, lol. Thanks!"
226,"I am a pharmacy graduate,so i am in that field"
226,I work at Sears.
226,"Oh,that is nice to know,what will be your daily routine "
226,"I sell washers, so it really depends on how many people are interested that day. Some days are pretty slow. You?"
226,"Its really new dimension for me about sears,because sears means always clothing and shoes only comes to my mind,Last year they closed so many showrooms right"
226,"Yeah, I lucked out and still have a job"
226,"Now i am doing a part time job,because i have some restrictions to take full time work"
226,I see. Have any hobbies?
226,Hobbies  right now only sometimes painting
226,Cool! I enjoy making music.
226,"what kind of music western or classical or jazz,do you know to play any instrument"
226,I like the bass. Have you ever dabbled in music?
226,No i never dabbled. ok bye
227,Hi! How are you doing today? I just got back from my trip to Colorado. 
227,That's awesome! I've never been to Colorado but I hear great things! haha
227,"Oh it was beautiful, I'll have to go back sometime soon. The next place on my list is Utah. What have you been up to?"
227,LOVE the mountains. Mainly in the New Mexico / Colorado area -- but also to the Alps. How about you?
227,"New Mexico is also great! You can always find the best salsa there. I love traveling and trying new foods, especially pies. "
227,Mexico has the best food culture and if you ever visit it is one of the best cities in the world to sample great cuisines
227,"Totally! Mexico seems fun, maybe Canada as well. There are so many places I want to see before my time is up in this life. "
227,i am sure ! i've been wanting to go to france .
227,"Oh that would be beautiful, the only bad thing about that is how long the air plane ride would be! "
227,"That's true, travel by train or boat isn't gonna be as good as airplane travel most of the time."
227,"Unless you're on a cruise ship, then it becomes more fun. "
227,That's true traveling by train can be really fun and cheap too somethimes
227,So true! It's been nice talking to you and catching up! 
228,What kind of salary you thinking of?
228,"Not sure, It depends how many companies offer. I'm just expecting a entry wage, around 40k"
228,"Not bad, are you married or have a family?"
228,"No, I have my girlfriend Luis here at the college with me. We like each other a lot right now."
228,That's good. Will you both work in the same city?
228,We hope too. Right now she's got the good job waiting for her after college. I'll have to try and follow her.
228,So when are you gonna put a ring on it?
228,Great Question! Hopefully when I graduate and I make about a years wage. Need to impress her
228,No need to impress when two people are in love. But do put yourself in a stable financial situation.
228,Thank you for that advice. That's what I hope to do. Do you own a house?
228,Yes I own several as an investor actually
228,"Oh wow, thats awesome. How did you get started with your properties?"
229,"yes, i have heard about them. they are really awesome. i also would like to play games often"
229,It's not for everyone. I just like the strategy and slow pace of the game. It is so serene.
229,oh ok.. do you like dogs? how about your other activities in day today life
229,I do like dogs. and walking the dog
229,oh so good. do you grew up dogs at your home ? 
229,No i didn't. Always wanted one so now i have one.
229,did not get what you say
229,I have a dog now. I didn't when i was younger.
229,oh ok i love to feed dogs and make them so happy. they are the ones who never hurt us and gives only happiness
229,They really are man's best friend
229,"yes, they are true stress busters. "
229,Not to say they aren't any responsibility. gotta walk and feed them
230,Well that's super cool. Have you ever seen an Armadillo in person before?
230,"I have, bunch of them when driving here in texas"
230,Oh cool! You live in Texas. It must be very hot there still.
230,Oh it was very hot today. Golfed in 95 degree weather
230,Oh wow. I don't think I would want to do that. I would need to bring a lot of water
230,"Definitely water, in a hydroflask to keep it cold"
230,"Cold water is much better than warm water, that's for sure"
230,Yup nothing better than crisp cold water on a hot day.
230,Nothing better
230,So what do you do for fun?
230,I like to do arts and crafts and I also enjoy taking long walks.
230,i love doing those things . we should be friends lol
230,yes we should! Thanks for the chat and hope to talk to you soon
231,You know what else makes me move? Music.
231,what kind of music do you like?
231,Pretty much everything. I hate country and jazz though. What about you?
231,"i also do not like country music , i do like jazz"
231,I think it's just the lack of excitement. It always reminds me of elevator music. I like stuff that gets me pumped up.
231,sometimes if it is to loud it gives me a headache
231,I can understand that. Only time I like loud music is when I'm hitting the gym.
231,how often do you go to the gym?
231,Pretty much every day. I am a verifiable gym rat! Haha.. what about you?
231,I workout at home
231,"Hey, that's just as good. I can't really play racquetball at home though, which is my favorite thing to do at the gym."
231,it saves on money
232,"I could, it's just going to be a pain to have to ship it back and wait for it all.  Still better than wasting my money I guess."
232,I think you should get Bluetooth headphones instead!
232,"That's a good suggestion, but what I want the headphones for doesn't support that sadly."
232,Why not?  What do you need them for?  For watching shows?
232,"It's to plug into an electronic I have that doesn't support bluetooth, it's just a regular stereo plug."
232,"Oh I see.  Well I used to be a musician, so I understand studio headphones.  You should get your money back!"
232,I'll definitely have to give it a try.  Do you have any headphone recommendations?
232,"I just ordered some headphones actually, some Cowin brand Bluetooth headphones. I like watching show and movies at night so I need some really nice headphones."
232,"I'll have to look at them and do a bit of research then, thank you for the suggestion!"
232,You're welcome. I hope you can get some really nice ones that suit your needs.  I shopped around before buying these!  Can't wait to get them.
232,"I sure hope so too, finding headphones that don't crap out on you and that aren't insanely expensive is tough."
232,I had a pair of Turtle Beach headphones for years and the mic finally died and the bass starting getting fuzzy.  They lasted me years though.
233,What's up! How have you been recently? 
233,I'm doing pretty good other than these braces hurting my mouth. How about you?
233,"Aw I'm sorry to hear that, my cousin had to wear braces for 3 years and she hated it. What's weird is that her twin didn't need any."
233,That's weird. Do twins run in your family? Are you a twin?
233,"Well, there has only been one set of twins in my family, and I'm hoping when I have children it will just be one kid at a time. "
233,the twins would definitely keep you on your toes
233,"Oh for sure! If I had twin boys I would probably name one Lex and the other Clark, my love of Superman will never die lol"
233,"My mom loves Superman, we used to watch the movies together all the time."
233,"Same! He was my favorite superhero as a kid. He's still my favorite today, but Batman is a close second. "
233,Batman is pretty darn sweet. The Dark Knight made me love him even more.
233,"Oh for sure. The Dark Knight movies were my favorite, but the Tim Burton Batman movies will always have a special place in my heart. "
233,I love Tim Burton movies! 
234,"I spend my free time fishing and camping and such, I don't buy much clothes other than outdoor stuff"
234,Awesome! Where do you buy your supplies for those hobbies?
234,I used to buy them at specialty sporting good stores but now I just use the internet
234,"that is very convenient, I also like to shop online. Are you married or dating?"
234,I'm casually seeing someone. Not sure if it'll go anywhere. You
234,I have a family. I spend a lot of time driving the kids to soccer and baseball practice
234,Do you enjoy that?
234,"Yes, there is a lot of joy in providing for my kids. It is difficult, but I enjoy my time with them. Where are you employed?"
234,I am a general manager at a casino
234,Wow! That is awesome. I love playing blackjack. Do you enjoy your work? 
234,I do! It can be very interesting sometimes. 
234,"""I bet!"" That is cool. Is there room to grow above your position?"
235,Yes I wonder what causes people to become like that? It alienates so many people from them.
235,I think that it's a mental health condition. Personally if I have too much stuff I give the extra to charity 
235,My Grandmother was like this and would get anxious whenever someone would move her stuff.
235,Perhaps she had old memories surrounding her possessions that she did not wish to get rid of 
235,Oh she would collect new things. Even go through stuff people put on the side of the road.
235,She probably hated to see anything thrown out. Personally I love coupons. 
235,Me too. It's such a rush when you cut all those coupons. Almost feels like real money!
235,It's definitely a fun hobby to have and saves money too. 
235,Do you have kids? I imagine someone would save a lot of money couponing with kids.
235,No I don't - does not stop me from liking coupining tho!
235,Haha. Me neither. I keep a little folder of them when I go to the store. Cashiers probably look at me like I'm crazy.
235,I know the people behind in the queue can get a bit irritable. 
236,"She always loved to try to steal food off my plate. Once, on my birthday, she managed to snag a whole steak for herself."
236,"Oh my, my dog actually does that sometimes. That's the worst!"
236,"It was pretty funny, actually. She always treated it like a game, and she definitely won that night."
236,"Yeah, she definitely won that one."
236,I miss her so much... What kind of dog do you have?
236,"Yeah, well I'm sorry to hear that. And she is a Labrador pitbull mix"
237,I have 2 dogs and a cat. My cat always gets on my tv when I play halo 3.
237,Nice to hear that.I too have a dog at home. The breed is lab.
237,Labs are great dogs. Mine are golden retreivers.
237,Working with a vet has helped me to understand and take care of my dog very much. 
237,That sounds like a cool job. I hope to be a video game developer one day.
237,That's great. I think you have a great creative mind Am I right?
237,I like to think so. So do you have any other pets?
237,I would love to have one more dog as companion to my lab. He will enjoy more. Let's see.
237,"Yeah, dogs are happier when they have a furry friend."
237,Yes I understand that. But space is a constraint in my home. My husband is a lawyer. His books occupy a lot of space.
237,I bet! I'm not a lawyer but books overrun my house too.
237,That's great. Reading is something I too enjoy a lot. It refreshes you mind like anything. What kind of books do you read?
238,what song is your favorite
238,I love the Beatles the best.
238,do you like hip hop?
238,I used to like hip hop when I was younger. It's a little too much for me these days.
238,do you like country?
238,I hate country music. Now I'm going to have strange dreams just thinking about it.
238,how old are you?
238,I was born in the late 1960s.  So pretty old.
238,where are you from?
238,I was born in Atlanta. Live near Boston now.
238,where do you work?
238,I have a home based technology job. I also earn a little passive income online.
239,Do you ever want to have kids someday?
239,Maybe in the future.
239,How many do you want to have? and you can ask me questions too 
239,"Probably two, i feel more could be overwhelming. What about you?"
239,I think 2 is a perfect number. And if I have kids I will make sure to make them barbeque sandwiches and pizza puffs
239,"That sounds yummy. What are pizza puffs, like pizza rolls?"
239,"Yes, it's like pizza on a roll, but not like hot pockets because the pizza part is on top of the bread rather than inside. What is your favorite food?"
239,Any kind of ice cream. What's your favorite flavor?
239,"Well I like Mint Chocolate chip myself, but I am also fond of coffee ice cream. Do you enjoy coffee?"
239,"I really dont like coffee, I much prefer tea"
239,Oh tea is good. And good for you! I also take some when I'm feeling ill
239,"I usually drink a cup every morning, but its too hot right now with a busted AC"
239,I understand that. It was pretty hot here but now it's getting cooler. I love the fall weather
239,"I love the fall, but we arent getting the weather here."
239,Where do you live?
239,"Hawaii, its pretty hot"
239,I have always wanted to visit Hawaii! maybe some day I will. It was very nice chatting with you
239,Nice talking to you as well! Have a good day
240,Well I am not sure. My boyfriend is actually in the army so is away a lot 
240,Is a more stable life and location for your boyfriend not something in the cards right now?
240,Alas not for the next few years but hopefully one day. 
240,So the plan is to just keep going with the relationship as you have been and just see how things pan out?
240,Yes. I am looking for a present for him right now - a tee shirt. I want it to be yellow as that is my favourite colour. 
240,Wouldn't it be better to get him a t shirt in his favorite color?
240,"well, erm, yes, good point. "
240,I'm sure he'll love it!  It's always nice to know the person you love is thinking of you.
240,"Yes, I think about him a great deal even though he is so far away. "
240,You should definitely tell him that if you don't already.
240,Oh I tell him very regularly but it would be nice to do so face to face. 
240,Oh absolutely!  When's the next time you can see him?
241,"Oh my, that is a long time! I heard they used to put cocaine in it before, too."
241,"Oh wow, that's crazy! I bet that's why my grandmother's house was always so clean in Chicago!"
241,Hahah! Yeah that can definitely be a reason why.
241,"We played a gig at a bar once and they only had Pepsi, I was so mad I broke my drum set."
241,No way! LOL. 
241,Yes! I have a slight anger problem but I'm learning ways to stay calm now.
241,"Yeah I was going to say, you may have anger issues lol. As long as you are trying, though!"
241,My only trigger now is if someone tries to give me Sprite. I hate Sprite.
241,Oh my gosh! Hahaha! 
241,"So other than Coke, what's your favorite drink?"
241,"Well, I'd have to say water. Plain and basic water!"
241,I do love me some water! 
242,Under the couch. I'm always misplacing things.
242,You are lucky to have a friend willing to help.
242,"I am! Sometimes we drink too much and fall asleep on the couch, haha. How is your day going?"
242,Going good...what's up with you.
242,"Good to hear! I'm just chilling. I work at a bar on the weekends, so making the most of my day off."
242,great to hear. i work for finance department so it would be hectic the year closing. 
242,"That sounds pretty full on, do you enjoy it?"
242,"It's pretty fun. The pay isn't great, but it keeps me busy. Decent work for now."
242,"That's cool, busy is good. Do you have any fun hobbies?"
242,"Mainly Youtube, I do some freelance work on it occasionally, and Reddit. Lots of Reddit."
242,"Haha, Reddit is the best. I spent too much time on there. Do you have a channel on Youtube? or helping someone else create content?"
242,"i like youtube , but i don t have a channel . i wish"
243,"Sure, let's hang out at my apartment this weekend, and I'll teach you"
243,That sounds great but since I'm a psychology major I might not have the time unfortunately
243,"Oh yeah, I've heard that psychology homework can get pretty lengthy and tough."
243,IT does but I still find time to watch Steelers games! Do you like football?
243,"I'm not the biggest fan, but my dad loves it. I sit and watch it with him while eating our favorite food, jello."
243,Jello is great! I used to make jello jigglers for Christmas with my Grandma.
243,Oohh I've been looking for new things to make with jello. Will you teach me to make them?
243,Sure! Do you like jello shots? Those are fun to eat.
243,I love those! It's my favorite thing to have at parties!
243,I've been to quite a few awesome college parties with jello shots in my college career lol
243,Lol same! It's a staple of college life lol
243,I'll definitely miss it once I graduate!
243,Me too!
244,"Me too, and I love visiting other countries and trying new foods there."
244,"I agree. Food is good!  I think I could understand vegetarians maybe, as they just avoid meat.  But avoiding eggs, dairy, etc is extremely challenging!"
244,"I would never survive as a vegan! I love cheese too much, and so do my cats."
244,You can do it. Being a vegan is not as hard as you think 
244,"I have no desire to be though. I love food too much, especially cheese."
244,It really limits your dietary choices.  I don't recommend it.   Have you considered vegetarian?
244,"No, I am not interested in that either. Have you considered it?"
244,"I haven't, but maybe I'll give it a try!"
244,Let me know how that goes! what would you eat?
244,"Mostly vegetarian dishes, making sure I get as many vitamins as I can. Fiber's good too!"
244,"Good luck with that! Meanwhile, I will travel the country with my cat, eating meat!"
244,I so wish I could be a cat... ohhh how easy life would be!
245,How exactly did you celebrate it?
245,"well, my birthday isn't for several months. i wanted to know about your party."
245,"Sure, I got surprised. Did not expect anyone remember my birthday"
245,why not? are birthdays not a big deal in your family?
245,You got it right. Poverty makes us forget about birthdays and parties.
245,that's too bad. who was present for your party?
245,family members and few relatives. They managed to come from oversees
245,"oh wow, what country did they come from?"
245,The Kingdom of Dreamland. Have you heard of it?
245,"no, i haven't. it sounds fictional."
245,It is in some sense
245,So what do you find realistic then?
246,I do work out some. Running mostly. 
246,where do you work?
246,I have a programming job for a small technology company.
246,"I see! Do you work on mainly PC games, console games, or both?"
246,Business applications. But I love video games and play in my spare time.
246,how old are you
246,I turn 40 tomorrow.
246,are you looking forward to turning 40 ?
246,No I'm hating it. I'm still in pretty good shape though. I eat pretty well and don't drink any alcohol.
246,well that's good for you . drinking isn't the healthiest thing in the world
246,"No, I quit when I turned 30. I smoke some weed now and then though."
246,what state do you live in?
246,I'm in Massachusetts.
247,I am diet
247,What sort of diet are you on?
247,Vegan diet
247,That's cool.  I cook a lot but I have never cooked vegan.  What is it about vegan that you like?
247,I just trying to be healthy
247,Healthy diets definitely help to improve your overall health. Keep it up.
247,How about you?
247,"Well, I guess you could say I'm pretty adventurous when it comes to eating. I like to cook new stuff to try all the time, mostly steaks though!"
247,That's great!
247,I like fish too.  Do vegans eat fish?
247,I am not fully vegan
247,Well then I guess you could enjoy a nice cat fish nugget platter!
247,Let me get your twitter
248,I hope so. I think they're going to the same place next year.
248,Do you think you will have a better opportunity to join the trip?
248,"I just need to discipline myself, focus on my work, and stop going to so many darn concerts!"
248,"I feel like the concerts are good, they allow you to unwind and relax"
248,"I love them. I go to at least 10 a year, sometimes more."
248,That is a lot. Who is your favorite?
248,"I absolutely LOVE Madonna. I've seen her at least a dozen times, but I think more."
248,Thats a lot. I prefer panic at the disco
248,I love them too! Why do you like them so much?
248,They got me through some tough times and I have been to a concert. They also support pride
248,That's amazing! I am part of LGBTQ+ so I love that.
248,That's awesome! SO am I. I am worried about the court cases
249,I like to blend into the background personally .. I want to look cultured and sophisticated though. 
249,It's always important to put your best fashion foot forward. That way people will think you're successful.
249,I have a problem with self esteem as I came from a broken home. 
249,I am sorry to hear that. Have you ever seen a therapist to help you with it?
249,No. I have a problem with my step dad but he ignored me all the time. 
249,So you don't think that therapy helps you at all?
249,I have not tried therapy - it is expensive. 
249,That's true. But maybe you can talk to a close friend or relative about it. I'm sure that would be better than nothing
249,"I could give it a try but it is difficult. What about you, do you have a good relationship with your family? "
249,Yes I do. I love my family very much. We don't always get along but I know they will be there for me when I need them. 
249,It must be wonderful to feel that!
249,I am fortunate in many ways. So many people have broken homes. It is sad to see.
250,Yes thank you. It should definitely be a goal to stay in great shape!
250,Lately I've just been wearing a lot of black since it's so slimming and it's my favorite color anyway lol
250,Slimming? How so?
250,Black clothing makes you look smaller so I hear.
250,Oh I see. Well hey if it's working then good for you! Lol.
250,"I found that eating foods I don't like helps too, I can't stand pickles so I eat a lot of those. It helps me not overindulge."
250,Eating foods you don't like haha! They are called fruits & veggies!
250,I need to eat those more often. Broccoli is probably my favorite food ever.
250,"Yes! Broccoli is amazing, although I always forget how to spell it."
250,YES! I always try to put 2 Ls in it every single time!
250,Same here! With one C haha
250,I need to find some new broccolli recipes to try out
250,Try google! Google is great for recipes.
251,Awesome.  Kyoto would be a great place to visit.
251,"it is on my bucket list , maybe we can meet up for lunch when i go"
251,That would be great!  Where would you like to meet for lunch?
251,somewhere that serves tradition style cuisine for that region
251,Ok...Let's plan on it then.  We can catch up on everything else that is positive in our lives.
251,"that sounds awesome, cant wait to see you."
251,"I know, it's been way too long since we've enjoyed lunch together.  When are you leaving on your trip?"
251,"im not entirely sure, but probably 2 weeks from now. i have some unfinished business i need to wrap up before i leave."
251,Got cha!  How long do you plan on being gone?
251,"maybe two month, i want to see everything i possibly can in that region."
251,"Yeah, you'll need a few months.  I know when I went to Cairo, Egypt, I stayed for three months.  "
251,"you went to egypt, thats so cool. thats the next place i want to travel to , to see the great pyramids of gira."
251,Yeah Egypt was amazing.  I went there twice.  Two very different experiences.  
252,"I am not sure, but I heard it over my loud pop music."
252,where do you live?
252,"I live mostly in Canada, but sometimes in NY. You?"
252,from america myself
252,What kind of music do you like?
252,all different genres
252,What is your favorite?
252,i am not sure really . yours ?
252,Pop music would be top of my list.
252,why is it top of your list?
252,Because it is my favorite.
252,why is it your favorite?
253,"I know, I do feel very guilty about it. But there's a basketball game starting I want to watch. "
253,Well give it back :) Stealing is not right
253,Maybe after the game. And then I need to go work out 
253,i know . now i feel guilty
253,Do you not work out? I do so every day
253,yeah . but not today . i like the gym
253,I love the gym .. I also love swimming and jogging. 
253,Main reason I started going to the gym was to get a break lol
253,What  did you need a break from? 
253,I guess a bad relationship and my dog passing away I've just needed some time to myself.
253,I am very sorry about that  - my dog is elderly and I dread her passing. 
253,Oh god. I'm so sad for you. Maybe a walk in the park will make you feel better. It always does for me.
254,Mummies were a big fad in England historically.
254,Mummies of humans and other animals have been found on every continent. So cool when you think about it!
254,I personally don't see the point in preserving corpses but I think the practices are neat!
254,"I feel the same, but I guess it does provide something interesting for future civilizations to uncover and learn about the past. "
254,"That's true! Sometimes I wonder how much we misunderstand their intentions, though."
254,"Definitely. The world is an extremely complex thing, and I don't know if we'll ever fully understand it."
254,It is! Makes me wonder how incomprehensible an alien civilization would be since we have so much trouble understanding the past of our own.
254,That's a really good point. Perhaps that's why he haven't made contact with an alien species. 
254,I wonder what will happen if we do.
254,Hopefully it's a peaceful connection! I'm hoping it'll be like humans and dogs - we can't communicate but we get along just fine.
254,That would be ideal. I don't see the need for conflict.
254,I agree. Peace would be great. It would be great to have another planet to have holidays on!
255,good. how is life going? how many kids you have ?
255,two children in high school . how many do you have ?

257,"nice, let me know how everything turned out. i might try it myself"
257,"I definitely will! Other than that, my social life has been better than I expected it to be lately"
257,how is that. what made your social life better
257,I think it's been due to me getting out looking for jobs. I've met a lot of interesting people.
257,cool...networking and meeting new people help out more  than you realize
257,It really does. So how have things been going for you lately?
257,i have to look for another job myself . the physical therapist i work for is to demanding
257,I know that feeling. My former boss was a pain too. Always micromanaging.
257,"yeah, you get it. we should be our own bosses and quit the rat race."
257,Exactly! I plan on doing that one day
257,cool .. maybe we can go into business together. you have any ideas
258,I've been there multiple times. Any other places?
258,You should definitely visit Japan! There is so much cool culture there and the landscape is beautiful.
258,Honestly I would prefer Europe. Have you ever been in Japan?
258,I have not been to Japan but I want to so much. I would love to visit Europe too. I want to see the Sistine Chapel
258,Maybe we can go together. When do you expect to be available?
258,I should be available after the holidays. Maybe some time in January. Does that work for you?
258,"That's fantastic. Here is a deal: I pay for the airfare, you pay for the hotel. "
258,I like that idea. I'll try to make sure I find us some place very comfortable with a great breakfast!
258,Do we need visas to cross the border?
258,I think there are some places that do require a Visa. I will look into it before we make our final plans
258,"OK, that's very important. Also do not forget to renew your passport."
258,"Oh yeah, I almost forgot about that! I have never actually had to get a passport before."
258,Very well. This trip should help to my brother to stay alone and think about his life.
258,I think it will bring you and your brother closer together and that's a great thing!
258,He has been having a lot of problems lately. Our parents were not able to help.
258,Well at least this vacation can be of some help to you. I can't wait! Thanks for the chat.
258,Thanks.

260,I have learnt to deal wit it.I'm now used to it.
261,Ii will! Maybe I'll listen to some jazz on my nightly walk through the forest?
261,maybe it will end up a nightly dance through the forest
261,That would be fun! As long as whoever is with me doesn't dance too close to me. That makes me nervous.
261,do you think you'll catch dance fever?
261,I just might! And there's no cure for it thank goodness!
261,Who needs a cure when you can daaaance! Where do you go for walks?
261,I usually go in the woods here by my home along the bank of the lake. The scenery is amazing
261,"gorgeous, the water at twilight must seem like a dream"
261,It really is. I could sit and look at it all night long!
261,Do you ever swim in the lake?
261,I do sometimes but not at night. That's a little too spooky for me not seeing underneath me.
261,"Ack, like lake placid!"
262,do you have kids?
262,"No, I don't but I really want my own. Do you like kids?"

262,I like that show too
262,Have you read the books for the show?
262,"no, have you?"

264,i love the fair especially the food
264,I have to cut back on my fair food now that I'm a 30 year old woman. My metabolism isn't what it used to be

265,"i prefer biographies, but i have a long commute so i have lots of time to listen. do you prefer fiction or non-fiction?"
265,"Fiction, however historic novels are my favorite. Who is your favorite writer?"
265,probably david mccullough. i don't think he writes any fiction though.
265,I admire Fyodor Dostoevsky. When I read his novels I realized that I was in a darkness and suddenly it became bright.
265,can you please tell me what his philosophy is and how it affect your life ?
265,He thought that the modern day civilization was too degraded and lost faith in God. He was interested in religion.
265,Good for you. Religion can be a source of hope and optimism for many people in times of distress.

269,"i completely agree , bouncing around alot as a kid really opened my eyes to different music ."
269,Were you an energetic child?
269,"Not Really now, because I am at home, and my friends are all at school, and no one from my home hits me up that much."
269,Ahhh damn. that must be rough. Maybe a long walk this weekend could help?
269,"Like that so  ng by Mariah Carey, I don't want to cry, lol.  It's probably just from being tired."
269,Do you need a big hug? Maybe blast some britney spears?

278,"I actually don't know much about those, even though a hobby of mine is reading. Maybe I should pick up a book about it"
278,I recommend you also try Darjeeling and Chinese greens. They have a cooling effect.
278,Oh that would be nice after cycling. That's a hobby I hope to compete in professionally or at least qualify for an event
278,That would be cool. Its one of the worlds most popular hobbies.
278,Oh that's awesome. It's healthy and fun! What are your hobbies?
278,"well besides hiking , i am seriously interested in drinking as much tea as i can ."

278,You never know
279,"That is funny, I like to dance but only after a few drinks in me lol!"

280,"I will give it a try, I also had my Masters thesis stored in there. "
280,Oh No! I remember one time I had a bunch of photos stored on mine from a cheerleading competition. Mine were lost forever. I hope they can help you!

289,Are you asking if I like them too?
289,I am sorry. I meant: Do you work late too?

290,I really love Ireland. It's sooo green (my favorite color) and the people there are wonderful. Plus the architecture is unparalleled.
290,I would love to go to Ireland. Sounds like a great opportunity! Is it difficult to become a flight attendant?
290,"It's not terribly hard. I had to go through some schooling for it and then on the job training, but it was worth it. What do you do?"
290,Well I am 15 so I don't have a job just yet. But I try to do dog sitting for people in my spare time. I absolutely love animals.
290,You have a lot of time to figure it out. Animals are always drawn to me. I'd love a dog but I'm gone all the time.
290,Animals have to have a lot of love and attention so it's probably good you don't have one. But you can always visit a petting zoo!
290,That's true. I try to go to major zoos when I'm in a new city but I don't always have time.
290,"Yes, aquariums too! if you ever come through Atlanta you have to visit the Georgia aquarium. They have 4 huge whale sharks!"
290,That would be fun! I've never been there before. I did just go to the one in New Orleans though. It was amazing!
290,I will have to try to visit that one too. Did they have a lot of tropical fish? I enjoy fish of many different colors.
290,They had a bunch but I'm from the Midwest and I thought it was odd they had deer at the zoo too.
290,"Oh that is interesting. I used to live in Colorado and you would see deer in passing all the time. In any case, it was lovely talking with you!"

295,"Oh? Well swimming does take a bit of time to learn, but once you get it, it becomes like walking, but in water of course."
296,Running helps you relax huh?
296,Yeah it lets me think about things. I think it's because I grew up in an athletic family. My brother is in the army now.
296,"Oh neat, where is he stationed at? My grandfather was in the air force, stationed in Kentucky. "
296,Right now he's not overseas. He did do 5 tours in Iraq though. He's home. His wife just had a baby.

296,Awwww that's awesome. Congratulations! Do you have a date set?
296,Right now we're planning for some time in November. 
296,That's coming up so fast. I bet you are so excited! Where is the wedding at? People used to do them on our farm growing up.
296,We're looking at a couple places back in Kentucky. We're originally from there.
296,Kentucky is beautiful. There's a lot of rolling green hills and open land. I'm sure you will find the perfect spot!
296,"I hope so. It will probably be somewhere around Knoxville, where my parents live."
296,"I'm not sure I've ever been there, but maybe someday. Right now I live in the middle of the country about 45 minutes from a town or store."
297,Right! Do you believe they are real?

299,It was the worst
299,Oh no! Did you have any injuries?

299,I've never been to New York but I can image. What company does your dad work for?
299,He works at the city's electric power plant. You should definitely come up to NY some time. There's a lot to see
299,"I've never been interested in New York, seems kind of gross to me. But I would love to visit France sometime."
299,Oh France is beautiful. And the food is even better. I definitely miss it and can't wait to go back

300,I think I like angel hair pasta the best because it is so fine and tasty.
300,"My daughter loves angel hair the best, my two sons prefer spaghetti though. She's just like me, us ladies prefer daintier things."
300,Oh yes! Whenever I have a thicker noodle I feel like I'm about to choke on it.
300,Do you like pizza or anything else? Pasta is your favorite?

300,That sounds so yummy! Do you enjoy coffee? I am a barista so I am quite the coffee connoisseur.

301,"Oh. Well mine is Ariel. I think she's beautiful, has amazing ingenuity, and is strong. "
301,The music in that one is good

301,"I'm way out of high school, I was in high school choir for 4 years though in the 90s :P"
301,Did you really like it? I can't imagine being graduated already.
301,"Choir was fun, I learned a lot of different music that I would have never known. We actually did the lion king one year"
301,I Love the music from Lion King. My favorite probably is the music from Beauty and the Beast or The Sound of Music.
301,"Those are good, Across the Universe was really good. It was based on the Beatles."
301,I Just saw a Beatles movie a couple of weeks ago. They had some pretty awesome music.
301,They had pop love songs down to an art.  They're pretty good. 
301,Yeah I can't imagine what kind of music they would be releasing these days.
302,"yeah its been tough, but i'll get through it. How has your day been?"
302,"I'm ok, did some shopping for ingredients for sushi. What's your favorite kind? I'd like to make you some."

302,"Oh, I used to love those, but I don't any meat other than fish these days"
302,Shrimp is about all the seafood I eat and calamari of course.
302,"Shrimp is amazing! Plus, I make a mean cocktail sauce. I haven't had calamari, though"

302,"Bacon, hash browns, and sausage are my all time favorite breakfast foods."
302,Now that sounds like a good breakfast!
303,"Thats cool, I love light blue eyes, Do you like light or dark?"
303,"I usually like light blue eyes too, did you know that the color blue is between violet and green in the light spectrum?"
303,Yes! I also love violet I have a collection of stones that are all shades of blue and violet
303,"That's really cool, I wonder how were they were formed, or where do they come from!"
303,"Im not sure, I buy them from a local shop, I should ask them when I ride my bike there this saturday"
303,"Yea, you should! I feel like you are gonna get to know very important facts!!!"
303,Do you have any collections too?
303,"Yea, I actually have a collection of baseballs!"
303,"Wow thats awesome, are any of them from famous people?"

304,"True! Both relaxing, too."
304,What other hobbies do you have? (Other than mturk of course haha)
305,"I love dogs, I have one."
305,"I have a dog too, she is a good dog. But how many of them aren't, right? What kind of dog is it?"

305,I adopted it. what do you do for a living?
305,Right now I work part time for Uber while attending college classes.
305,"that is nice, I am currently looking for a job, I am a trained accountant"
305,"That sounds hard. I'm majoring in social studies... but I'm failing some of my classes, like women's studies."
305,I could try modelling but I am not very tall
305,"I could never do that... this might sound silly, but I'm deathly afraid of making left turns! All my friends tease me and call me Zoolander."
305,that is very funny. you should try work at it
305,"Nah I think it is an OCD thing, not sure. You could be a model they aren't required to be tall, I think."

306,"I'm sure they're great names...my niece named Ollie. Well...that's the name I agreed to after several suggestions from her, like Dog and Spot, lol."
306,that is very pretty name
307,For real. Chicken nuggets are by far my favorite fast food meal. What about you?
307,"I know this is so basic, but I love fries, especially seasoned fries and a side of ice cream"
307,"My friends like to dip their fries in the ice cream, but I've never done that."
307,"If you've got the right pairing, it can be fun, but I typically will just eat them separate"
307,Do you have any hobbies?
307,I love playing around with tech and following the stock market. What about you?
307,I like to play baseball and hang out with my friends.  Do you work in a technological field?

308,"Oh, I did read that one in high school. I had no idea it was so old. Did you know the genre has origins in rome and greece?"
308,"No, I didn't know about that one! It's difficult to imagine such an ancient civilization doing one of the most popular forms of literature nowadays!"
308,Have you ever  read any historical romances like Wuthering Heights or Moby-Dick?
308,"No, not that ones, but I did ready Romeo and Juliet!"

312, I'd be happy to travel anywhere if the people were nice and the food was good :)

341,That is what i like about them
341,Sometimes i even watch till 1 am.Every weekend i usually go to bed late due to binge watching
341,That can be dangerous
341,Yes i usually wake up the following morning feeling really tired
341,You should keep time and be disciplined
341,Sure i always avoid watching on weekdays as i have to wake up early in the morning to go to work
341,That will be okay
341,Apart from watching i also enjoy listening to music my favorite band is rise against
342,figure skating! do you have any talents or hobbies you enjoy?
342,i go to a private high school and i play tennis with other students!
342,that sounds so fun! i don't play any sports but i do enjoy singing quite a bit
342,"oh thats cool, you should hear my parents since with their thick euro accents haha. i dont have one "
342,how interesting! what part of europe are they from?
342,Bulgaria. It's so far away!
342,that is very far! it must have been quite an adjustment for them to leave home and move somewhere so new
342,"Yes, we did - my family moved great distances for much of my youth."
342,"i'm sure that was difficult at times. i've always lived in the same place, but i would love to travel and see new places"
342,"me too ! i have never been out of the country , i wish i could go to europe !"
342,going to europe would be amazing! i am hoping maybe i can make it big as a singer and travel the world someday
342,"you will ! as long as you work hard at it , you will get there !"
343,"yes,  I want him to be an athlete just like me"
343,"yes, expectation sir..  "
343,i don't like my job much though. what do you do?
343,"sure , may be also .. "
343,"All that running gets me tired sometimes, being an athlete is hard"
343,i miss more money .. also 
343,How much do you make?
343,wow .. super .. 
343,"So, what are your hobbies?"
343,any loan sir 
343,"I'm not sure what you mean. Anyway, have to get back to that job that I really don't like haha"
343,"thank you , good job sir"
344,He stole money after I was boasting about having plenty of clients this week.
344,Well that's not very good! Well hopefully you can use this to teach him a lesson and you can both move on positively from this experience!
344,I hope so. Anytime I try to talk to him he gets upset and thinks I'm talking to him like one of my clients. 
344,"Well, my Dad was a car salesman and when I was young I used to think like that, maybe try to reason with him?"
344,"I try, but it's so difficult. He has a gambling problem and most of my clients have the same issue."
344,Have you tried taking him to some sort of gambling anonymous meetings? Seems like that might work :)
344,I need to make him want to go. I wish he'd work with me maybe that would change him.
344,"My Dad tried to get me to work with him, all it did was add pressure and stress to my life"
344,I didn't even think of that. I just thought maybe seeing other much older people with the same problem would make him change.
344,Yes it can maybe used as baby steps or initial steps to help him get a long with people over time!
344,I just wish he'd establish himself. I wouldn't mind him gambling if he had his own money.
345,"yeah, I thought id be more into it. Im from san fran where are you from?"
345,"I'm from Seattle like my favorite band Pearl Jam, I like to sing their songs on karaoke night on fridays"
345,"cool! Im more into classy stuff, I play some too. Like the smell of my own juice you know what I mean"
345,"that sounds nice. what do you do for fun? I'm into crosswords, crocheting, and watching football "
345,"I like to smell my own farts, not a big fan of others though. Do you smell things often?"
345,"Can't say I do, I like the smell of the wings at the karaoke bar"
345,My favorite are the buffalo wings. Which do you go for?
345,Oh I love chicken wings! Buffulo Wings are my favourite - with Blue Cheese dressing
345,Im not big on the blue cheese but maybe buffalo and ranch
345,Nothing better than some hot wings while watching a game of football
345,What is your favorite team? I just watch the super bowl sometimes but my wife loves the patriots
345,I am a big New England Patriots fan.  My boyfriend likes the Green Bay packers though.
346,he has always kept his word
346,That's nice you can depend on him. Me and my dad both love reading sci fi space adventures
346,i love painting but my dad loves going out to the nature
346,i am glad that you are able to find things to do with your father .
346,yes it was much fun

346,i watch more of comedies
346,"I like comedies, but I'm a sci fi nerd mostly"
346,they are too serious for me
346,It's cool. It's not for everyone.

347,"anyways I think I have to get back to work, the marketing agency needs me"
347,bye
347,"OKay, have a good day!"
348,do your friends allow you use their cars?
348,"sometimes but I don't get out much, I work at home from my computer"
348,"oh that's great, i have to travel to work myself, what do you do"
348,I work from home. It is very interesting and it pays decent. No boss! Thats the best part.

348,"if i have a job just like you, i would do much cooking because i am my own boss"
348,"That's awesome, I wish I was my own boss"
349,I have always loved this city attracts the most powerful people in the world to invest here
349,The idea of making a lot of money in the city is also something that fascinates me. I love money.
349,Though with a lot of money the cost of living here is very high
349,"That is true, and I need to earn enough to support my dog as well!"
349,Wow you have a dog i am also planning to adopt or buy a dog 
349,"Adoption is great, it gives a dog that might otherwise be put to sleep a new home."
349,Yeah plus they are the best companions do you have any suggestions for me
349,If you were going to live somewhere like New York I would suggest a small dog to fit in an apartment. There are lots of rescues.
349,Thanks for the advice i will take that into consideration.So apart from loving dogs i also love travelling though i have never traveled out of the country
349,I also enjoy traveling!

362,"Oh snakes terrify me, I don't think I could ever keep one as a pet."

362,but do you know most snakes do not have venom?
362,I don't think so.
363,i'm sorry to hear that.
363,"It's ok, she is in a much better place now. "

364,Have you been trying to sell it for long?
364,not too long but long enough to get frustrated
364,Have you tried a car dealership?
364,"not really, haven't had time to get round to it"
364,Do you really like classic cars?
364,"they are pretty cool, but my favourite thing is non gmo foods, what things do you like ?"

365,"Yes, I am. I will get a nap soon. Hope you are having fun over there!"
365,I wish i could get a nap:(. Need to clean up a bit than go to work :)
365,Sorry to hear that. I hope you can rest enough this coming Weekend!
366,"i suspect that, i wonder who?"
366,"you should ask them, that's just not nice"
366,"they will probably deny it, i think i should write a note to tell them off"
366,"i know, no one would take responsibility, but guess the telling off note would do as well"
366,"Now should i say, USE SOAP OR LIQUID man, ha ha ha ha. What do you think"
366,"that is a good start, at least who did it would know in them self not to try it again"
366,"good point, or maybe i will put back all the dirty dishes back into the sink for them to clean again."
366,"not bad, just that innocent ones would also be affected with the guilty person"
366,that's the thing or maybe we should buy a dishwasher.
366,"dishwater are expensive,but what's the guarantee they would use it also, hahaha."
366,"you can't win in these situations,i will have a house meeting and tell everyone to be better with the cleaning , i think that's a good start"
366,"the best idea among the rest you've brought up, just be civil about it and hope that works"
367,"I feel like i could dance and sing to it! I love to sing, how about you?"
367,"I do love to sing!  Would you consider yourself a singer, or a vocalist?"
367,"I'd say I'm a newbie in it, my wife hates when i sing :(. Do you have a partner?"
367,"Yes, I do. I have a great habit. I always wake up early to watch the sun rise every day "

367,That's a lot! I only work part-time :). How do you manage your time?
367,With the help of my partner and I only work 4 hours on Sunday. 
367,That's not bad. She's sounds like a great woman!
367,She's a life saver indeed!
367,Hope it'll stay that way. Wish you the best!
367,You too! Thanks!
368,"Wow he looks so young, would not think he was 32."
368,As a child he was a Michael Jackson impersonator and put on performances.
368,"I wonder what else he does, do you think he enjoys playing games? "
368,I don't see why not. What types of games did you have in mind?
368,"Action games I think, I like those. Did you know Call of Duty was released six years ago? Crazy!"
368,"It seems so long ago doesn't it? Personally, I'd rather play race car games and maybe find a red car that matches my real one."
368,"I enjoy racing. I might visit a national park later to have fun, what will you do later?"
368,Which national park were you going to visit? I'll probably drive my red car to the beach later
368,"Yellowstone probably, did you know it is considered the world's first national park? The beach seems like fun!"
368,I didn't know that. What year was it founded?
368,"I believe it was founded on March 1st 1872, it's way older than me. "
368,Haha. I would hope so! I may need to visit that park soon. I hope you have a good time

371,"I like that idea, I could call it Purple Royalty."
371,"lol, great name!! Where did you grow up? I was born and raised in New Hampshire. I miss it. "

382,"It started as part of a school project If I remember correctly, I may be wrong, though."
382,That's really interesting. School projects can lead to great things. But that reminds me that my last date was back in high school.
382,"Could be worse, you could have gotten married."
382,lol... That's what some of my friends say too.
382,I don't really believe in marriage. I mean it's alright just not for me.

383,I work in an art store. 
383,"ok, that sounds interesting,i really like watching star trek"

384,Maybe I'll check it out one day. I'm sure it would be unique.
384,"most definitely , along with the beautiful scenery, kansas is live, with a wide range of culture "
384,Really? I've never heard anything about its culture.
384,"They are governed as an independent so their culture is very unique in that sense, but they are also very old and cultured"
384,I'll have to do some research on this when I get out to the library.
384,"You should, it is worth a look! and the do a follow up by coming and visiting the place, you will love it"
385,"no i dont, i work in a coner grocery store during the day and watch the door at a club where they play punkrock"
385,"That sounds great, I am too old for clubbing now as I am 53."
385,"wow, what happened to the thought that life begins at 40?"
385,"All downhill from 40, especially as I am so overweight."

386,Cats are my favorite animal as well! I have two of them!
386,"same, I also love dogs"
386,Do you have any of those?
386,yes. I have one called Randy  He's really cute 
386,That sounds awesome. I don't have any dogs. They always get me a bit nervous.
386,it makes me nervous at times too
386,lol... I couldn't imagine living with them then.
386,yeah they are just spoiled
386,So many pet owners spoil their pets. I bet I do too. I think they get so lonely when I go to work at the library.
386,Yes i personally only have 1 cat and 1 dog and i think it is more than enough hahah
386,I could imagine. They really wear you out.
386,Plus they leave me alone briefly lol
387,Haha I really don't think so. His songs are lovely anyway
387,are you a fan of prince ? purple rain . . . purple rain . . .
387,"Well yes I am, he was such an amazing singer. Do you like music?"
387,"I love music, mostly I only listen to Cindy Lauper."
387,"That is an amazing singer too. When I bought my home, I listened to Prince all day for the first day haha"
387,"Wow, didn't you get bored of listening?"
387,"I could do that over again, it's quite easy for me. Do you own a home?"
387,"Not at the moment. I live near a road , so it's too dangerous to have one right now."
387,"Alright that's fair enough, any plans of maybe moving out and buying one?"
387,not unless my career takes me there . we are settled for now .
387,I live in Virginia and I love it here. Where do you live?
387,"I live in England, I want to move soon."
388,"haha, are you for real, i have eight grandchildren"
388,"Yes, I'm real. I'm an only child here though."
388,"wow, are you married? my grandchildren make me stay active"
388,"Yeah, I'm married. No kids though. I don't know how I'd deal with them. But we do have a pet lizard named gila."
388,"wow, you should get one, trust me your world will change "
388,I'm sure it would change. Maybe too much though.
389,"I've been crying so much lately. Even worse than when I watch ""Gone with the Wind."""
389,I love that movie.
389,It's one of my favorite movies as well. I just wish it was a bit hapier.
389,What was your hamster's name?
389,His name was Tibet. Because I had just seen an exhibit at the museum about Tibet the day I adopted him.
389,Ah.  Where was the exhibit?
389,The American Museum of Natural History in NYC. It was only temporary. It had been traveling around the world.
389,Do you like museums?
389,"Yes, I love museums! I always love learning new things and seeing different things."
389,"I love museums as well, they really help teach the public about different things we may not otherwise know"
389,That's very true. Do you have a favorite museum?
389,Yes.  I love the Art Institute of Chicago.
390,Yes they are 
390,"I wish my parents were interesting, they are no fun"
390,Why is that? 
390,"They are boring, are your parents boring?"
390,No. Mine are really interesting people 
390,Really? What do they do?
390,My dad is a football coach while my mum is an occasional actress 
390,Oh wow. so she's kind of famous it seems
390,Not really lol 
390,maybe she will be famous one day
390,Hopefully. Do have a nice day 
390,you do the same
391,Hmm. That sounds really interesting. I bet it would look nice on some clothes. I personally love collecting clothing with exotic prints from thrift shops!
391,"I agree, another one of my favorite thrift shops is the Wolverhampton Society for the Blind.  They sell trinkets made by blind people, which I think is really cool."
391,Oh wow. That sounds so engaging. Charity is always a great thing.
391,"Yes, one of the earliest shops was started by the Wolverhampton Society for the Blind to help raise money for the Society!"
391,That's really a very touching history. I should shop there.
392,Of course. Going to the gym is one thing I find interesting to do.
392,I was never good at sports so I have not been to many gym's.
392,I noticed I was looking frail after I lost my parent so I started using the gym to look active. 
392,If you want to look fit and strong the gym is where you should go that for sure.
392,"Sure. Maybe you need a little push, not necessarily a sad event like mine."
392,My health is the only push I need at least I hope so.
392,Even the slightest compliment about how fit you are looking is a motivation already. 
392,I would have to agree with you on that.
392,I find joy in little things such as a compliment
392,"Me too, especially when it comes from people you look up to."
392,I have a trainer. Having him smile at me at the gym is something I look forward to. He inspires me.
392,Trainers are good for keeping you motivated also.
393,"Yeah I got a warranty but it's so annoying, do you drive a car?"
393,"Yes, I couldn't live without my car.  I pick up my grandchildren from school each day, they are my world.  I couldn't do that without driving."
393,"Aww that sounds lovely, do you listen to music with them? Like Justin Bieber?"
393,"No they can't sit still long enough.  I listen to my headphones, I like oldies, like The Beatles."
393,"Cool, I'm listening to Olivia Newton-John right now! "
393,"I love her!  We like to be outdoors, walk to the lake near my house.  The kids love that.  Do you like being outside?"
393,"I do, I really enjoy going camping. Sometimes my family comes with me and we have a great time."
393,That sounds nice!  Camping can be alot of fun.  Where do you camp?
393,We have some awesome parks here in England that I go to. Where are you from?
393,"I was born and raised in Romeo, Michigan.  I am still there, I love it here.  I don't think I will ever leave."
393,"I don't think I've heard of it, I would love to travel to different places."
393,You should come visit me!  I think you would like it.  There are also tons of campgrounds.
394,My brother is a broker he does the trading for us.
394,He works for you?
394,Not really he just advises us on when and what to invest in.
394,"I understand that, but do you have a personal investment portfolio that will be directly affected?"
394,Yea when it is in a positive way .
394,It's good to see that you have a positive attitude about it like me.
394,In that line of business you have to keep a god attitude.
394,I agree. Stock is not my thing though. I love been creative. Something like a blog or web page
394,I have a you-tube page I share it with my mother.
394,That's very interesting. Does she create and post contents too?
394,Yes she makes videos on knitting and house keeping.

401,"Yeah, the games are fun. Especially since the Rams are good now. They stunk for a long time."
401,I guess I should give it a trial too
401,Sure - you would have fun. It is a long day though. Will take up nearly your entire Sunday.
401,How about we hook up
402,This is bad for the future and the government. A lot of health risk comes with been obese. 
402,Yes it would. Childhood obesity is also a concerning issue. It is associated with negative affects on children's health.
402,This is why I believe physical education should be mandatory in schools. It will help reduce this drastically. 
402,"Yep, I agree. I like to eat, don't get me wrong. It's just that people aren't being shown the importance of balance and exercise"
402,"Exactly. I love the balance so much that when my cat started adding weight too fast, I reduced her meal. "
402,You sound like a caring pet owner. I feel overweight so I am going jogging in 30 minutes
402,Yeah. I love pets. I jog only on weekends. I will be tired at work if I jog on weekdays. 
402,I love pets too. And any exercise is better than no excercise. You're all ready on a good path.
402,Imagine not understanding orders just because you exercised before going to work. I work at a coffee house by the way.

404,"I can't eat or drink dairy, I am intolerant. I love fish, and fishing.  Do you fish?"
404,This is funny
404,What is funny?  Fishing?
404,Fishing is a my hobby though. I love eating chicken
404,"I personally love chicken, My wife makes the best fried chicken.  Are you married?"
404,"Yeah, I am. But I doubt if your wife makes sure great chicken as mine"
405,I can teach you many french things like how to make french toast for starters.
405,Can you make French bread? Lol. I like to cook.
405,Coking helps me relax and wind down after a stressful day.
405,"you know, some stress can be healthy and good for you."
405,What kind of stress is that this is new to me please explain?
405,Mild stressors prepare your body to handle larger stress! Like getting a vaccine - it creates an immune response.
405,I see so stressing out your mind makes it stronger.
406,I used a local thrift store. They were sort of new and like 80% off
406,What else do you buy from thrift stores?
407,Yes they do
407,You love their chickens too?
407,I do. It's really spicy 
407,I always want to go back there. You see movies too
407,"I do, but during my free time "
407,"Sure, In recent weeks I haven't been to the movies too"

407,Yeah. Do have a nice day 
407,You too
408,I actually love to go fishing. Do you fish?
408,i'm not a big fisherman .
408,"Okay, that's understandable. Do you like Jimi Hendrix? He is my favorite musician."
408,"Yes, he was the best musician ever."
408,"Wow, glad you agree! Have you seen him in concert?"
408,"No, unfortunately but I have seen some of his concerts on tv."
408,"Oh nice, I've seen some concerts on youtube. What is your favorite song by him?"
408,I loved his song Starfish and Coffee when I was much younger
408,"Oh yeah, that's a good one. "
408,Do you like any other musicians besides Jimi Hendrix
408,"Yeah, I love the band Lord Huron. Have you heard of them?"

409,"It is a symbol for LGBT pride, but I am not sure how it came to be or what it represents for certain people"
409,"Interesting to have this discusssion today, as it is pride month where I live. There's a massive parade on Saturday that celebrates all kinds of sexuality."
409,"There might be here too, but I have to admit I don't follow personally. Only what I see on the news"
409,"well, the LGBT movements started in the early 20th century, so it definitely started becoming more socially accepted around then."
409,"Unfortunately, the movement still has a long way to go. The small mindedness of some people is so upsetting."
409,Absolutely. Things have gotten so crazy that's it's almost pointless to engage others in objective discussion.
409,I think people get in a certain mindset and are just too stubborn to try and see that they might be wrong. We are all stubborn in some sense
409,"Yes and one of the most important statuses of a person is gender, it breaks my heart that people can be so close minded, especially parents."
409,How funny that you said that. My son literally came out to me 3 days ago. He had been scared of what I would say.
409,"Oh, well just trust in the Son of God and you'll be saved"
409,"I trust in my religion, and I love my kid. I only feel for the rough path he might have ahead due to other people. I cant protect him forever."
409,"i understand how it is , but you cannot hide who you are from god"
410,of course i go elsewhere. how about you?
410,I don't like travelling
410,ohh i see. i enjoy travelling.
410,I'm scared of flying
410,you ever been in a plane?
410,"No, I don't like it. I'm always scared it's going to crash."
410,"Well you are not entirely wrong as your worries are valid, but you know the fun things of life are on the other side of fear. face your fear!"
410,"Hmmm, that sound like it. I'll give it a trial."
410,"You should. Airplanes are not that bad, actually the first time is always memorable, the raging emotions don't leave in a hurry."

421,That would be nice. I'm on a diet myself. To keep my body in shape at all times
421,I'm on a college budget so it's hard to buy healthy food. It's so much more expensive than the junk food is.
421,I thought cooking at home is cheaper. Junk foods are mostly what you buy when eating out
421,"A head of broccoli cost me $4.00. A bag of chips is $1.00. Chicken breast $7.00 , Bologna $2.00"
421,Now that's expensive. Do you work?
422,i like to play piano

423,i'm still learning. i'm also trying to see what type of games are popular
423,"Well good luck, that sounds like a challenging role!"
423,it's okay. lol. what do you want to do in space?

424,Never tried it. My relaxing hobby is gardening. I love roses! You?
424,Well my main hobby is listening to folk music and sometimes playing the guitar. Wood cutting was just a thing I did in college. 
424,"You'd fit in great at my house. My parents are old hippies, met at Woodstock, named me ""Rose""! "
424,"Lol my parents are the same way, I miss them, I'm in the navy and don't have time for family anymore. "

425,I played volleyball in high school.

426,"same with india. we live near a river, so it's fun to go swimming when it's super hot. what do you do for fun?"
426,i like doing outdoor stuff ! mostly oceans and exotic type things ! swam with manta rays once !
426,that is so cool! 
426,its really neat when you see a manta ray jumping out of the water ! like a bird .
426,"i had no idea they did that. i've never seen the ocean, so that is crazy to think about."
426,Haha yea seems like it would be really cool to see in person. 
426,agreed. have you ever seen a shark?
426,"yes, i have seen a shark when i went inside the ocean with the help of fishermen."
427,"Jet skiing is lots of fun, have you ever been scuba diving?"
427,Yes! I've been scuba diving once. that was when i was small
427,I do a lot in the water since I live close to the ocean.  I also love parasailing. 
427,sounds very relaxing ! do you live around an area with a beach ?
427,"Yes, a beautiful white sandy beach that has some great sea shells on it. "
427,sounds wonderful . what ocean do you live by ? i would like to know
427,"I live next to the Pacific Ocean, on clear days the water is a deep rich blue. "
427,"sounds amazing . i love the color blue , i'm picturing the clear blue skies and water . i would love to visit the place"
427,"If you came to visit I would make some awesome crabs, have a bake at the beach. "
427,"that would be wonderful , i cannot bake ."
427,"I'm a wonderful baker, what is your favorite dessert?"
427,"Well, I'm thinking something fruity. Maybe berry or watermelon?"
428,I'm a somewhat of a history buff.
428,Ya that's good for him.
428,I like to talk to him about the football history sometimes.
428,My kid is strange. He likes to look up the history of things he's into.
428,That's not too strange. He's just curious.
428,oh well what grade are you in ? my son is in 9th grade .
428,I'm way out of grades hehe. I wonder if your son knows my nephew though. He's in 9th grade.

429,Any apps you recommend?
429,"not really, but I might research and try to learn a language"
429,That’s ok.  If you would like to learn start simple
429,"its making a choice that might be hard Spanish, french, Portuguese which is easy to learn"
429,I think Spanish is pretty difficult. French seemed easier to learn.
429,"is it, so can i use an app or possibly find someone who knows the language to teach me"
429,supposedly . honestly once you know a few dozen languages they start to come very easy .
429,"you seem to know, do you speak another language besides english"

433,I work from home. Do you have a job?
433,I work online too
434,Ibelieve teachers should be paid so much more than theyare
434,Thats exactly how I feel. Some teachers seems like they just want the check and wee all know teachers don't get paid much.
434,sorry just got carried away.  I do that sometimes
434,"Its OK, I am only in my 2nd year of college and hope to get a job as a teacher though."
434,You should look into being a professor.  It pays more
434,"That's actually something Iv'e considered wanting to do, but I hear it's pretty good pay and benefits!"
434,It is a lot better than a public school teacher.  They make nothing
434,"I always think that the kids deserve the best teachers no matter what, If I become a teacher I will petition for better pay!"
434,The teachers do that all the time but it doesn't seem to help. The government does care.
434,And they wonder why most kids nowadays cant do something as simple as reading words. smh
434,Very true my child is in a private christian school.  Public schools don't teach them anything
434,so do the private schools pay teachers better than public schools? 
435,I've watched some foreign cartoons
435,You mean the Japenese cartoons that are quite colorful?
435,"Some, but also lots of Italian cartoons."
435,"I'm not familiar with Italian cartoons, do you watch them on Youtube? "
435,Some of them. I bootleg a lot.
435,"I do as well, hope I don't get caught!"
435,A lot of older films and shows are in the public domain
435,How are they making money off what they are known for though if they give it away for free?
435,The mindset of the public domain is that the art is old enough its fallen out of copyright - usually several decades after the death of the creator. 
435,"That's cool, I didn't know that.  I like showing older stuff to my son, see if I can foster an appreciation for all forms of artwork. "
435,The Internet Archive is a great resource. It catalogs a lot of things from the library of congress.
435,"Thanks, I'll have to check it out.  "
436,I like to run. Have you ever run a marathon?
436,"no , but i'm into running. I jog at times though"
436,I run five times per week. And I have run a few marathons.
436,That is lovely. What else do you do?
436,I like movies. Do you like to watch movies?
436,yes . i do enjoy movies a lot
436,I like super hero movies. What are your favorite movies?
436,What is your favorite super hero movie?
436,I loved the Iron Man movies. And the Spiderman movies with Tobey Maguire.
436,those were hilarious ! i like those and bruce almighty too .
436,"Yeah, Jim Carrey is funny. What is your favorite comedy movie?"

437,"I like to read and make art. I watch silent movies, too."
437,I start playing piano. Did you play piano?
437,I can't play any instruments.  Do you like folk music?
437,Not really. I prefer alternative rock.
437,"Cool, I like that too. What kind of movies do you like?"
437,I like action/adventure movies. And you?
437,I watch old movies. Silent films most recently.
437,What do you do for living?
437,I am a substitute teacher. But I just applied for a part time job at the library. 
438,Young people tend to be very good with that sort of thing
438,"nope,  young people know everything already."
438,"yes, they suffer from know-it-all syndrome. It's why it's hard to ask them for help sometimes. Gives them a big ego!"
438,"remembering, learning and retaining new information are a few of the most common complaints of older adults."
438,"for me it the pace of the way things, especially technology changes. You can learn it, but by then the info is outdated."
438,"That is true in a way, it is just very slow"
438,I need auto-update for my brain!
438,there you go ! people definitely need software FOR THE BRAIN
438,"Give technology 20 years, I'm sure we'll be downloading and uploading (syncing) our ""brains"" with our smartphones and we won't really have to ""learn"" anything anymore!"
439,Oh wow...who have you heard most recently that you like?
439,"I can't think of anyone in particular. Techno is pretty much all I listen to, so my faves change. What kind of music do you like?"
439,I like Techno music but I also like Classic Rock like ZZ Top and that sort.
439,"Wicked, brother! Classic rock is classic, yes, indeed! What's your favorite classic rock artists? "
439,"Oh gosh...all of them...Van Halen, AC/DC, Aerosmith (although they weren't considered really rock back then) and of course ZZTop. "
439,ac dc is awesome ! they have got so many great hits ! i have one of their band shirts from the 80s.
439,Really?  You ever think of selling it on Ebay? 
439,Nah. My wardrobe is full of old band tees. I'd never think of selling them. 
439,That's probably best because then you would definitely miss them.
439,You're totally correct. (:
439,I live in the country so I just turn it up and hope the dogs don't mind the noise...they don't :)
439,lol nice. it must be nice not having many neighbors.
439,It is...I like the privacy. I will take a big bowl of pasta and a bottle of wine and sit on the porch til nighttime.
440,very enjoying of my life
440,You and your husband are lucky to have such a relationship
440,yes god gift for my husband.

440,yes
440,Pets can be a great source of comfort
440,very comfort
440,They can help to divert your attention from problems and other issues
441,what you did not ? i don't understand 
441,I'm not sure why I said that.  What do you do for fun?
442,"Yes, I have 2 roommates and we like to go to the park together on the weekends. What do you like to do in your free time?"
442,I do a little bit of both working and watching/listening to TV - it's my quiet time.
442,That sounds nice. I usually read during my quiet time. What TV do you like?
443,I'm looking forward to going to summer camp.
443,Have you ever been to summer camp before?
443,"No, I'm only in the 3rd grade, so this will be new for me."
443,I bet you will love it. What are you most looking forward to?

443,"Got it. I play forward. Soccer will be a great way to meet new friends, too. "
443,That's what I was hoping. I'm new in the US and need more friends.

445,so what type of books do you like to read
446,Nice! I really need to go get my nails done. It's so relaxing.
446,"yes , definitely ! a good pedicure always helps me to unwind as well ."
446,It's kind of like therapy lol. So what do you do for a living?
446,"I'm a landscaper. It's kind of rough work at times, but it's rewarding to see your vision come together, especially when you have to work with a big team."
446,That sounds neat. How long have you been doing that? I'm currently unemployed but my husband works as a corporate attorney.
446,about 6 years . give or take a little . very rewarding as far as people i meet .
446,I can imagine. I bet that keeps you really physically fit.
446,yes it does ! and i am willing to work off the extra fat .
446,Haha I'm not much of a fan of exercising myself. 
446,"fortunately , i got into great shape and that helped . what do you enjoy ?"
446,I enjoy music and painting. What about you?
446,i love music also and football
447,Good Morning. How and where do you learn to play the viola?
447,I took classes in school.
447,How long have you ben playing the viola?
447,Only about a year.
447,Are you going to continue to take lessons?
447,Definitely as long as I can afford them.
448,My son is in dance and he gets bored with the strict repetition of moves. 
448,"I can understand that. After many failed attempts, my oldest son gave up but then watched a youtube video and learned in about 15 minutes..."
448,Learned what specifically?  How to Moonwalk?  I tried and failed miserably after watching a video on how to do it. 
448,"He was trying to learn how to do the robot. He wanted to ""move like that man on the street"" as he put it. "
448,"Oh how fun, we're so lucky we live in an age where Youtube and such exist.  "
448,For real! I was impressed by what you can find on the internet now a days.
448,"Oh I love to shop online, the magic of the being able to buy anything and everything with just a few clicks is amazing. "
448,No joke! So many conveniences. But my favorite place to shop is at goodwill. Me and my son go there a lot.
448,"I love Goodwill, you can find such awesome bargains.  I like to shop at local thrift stores too, they have some hidden gems. "
448,"They really do have lots of great things at thrift stores, even nice clothes. And sometimes you can fine clothing created from eco-friendly fabrics."
448,I really should pay more attention to being environmentally friendly.  
448,"you should! it is a great benefit to your finances if you go green, like turning off your lights, using less water ect. "
449,"Yeah, but I will give him another chance to have a relationship with me. I have a lot of friends, so I am happy anyway."
449,That's good. Sometimes patience can be a virtue. 
449,I like to ride scooters. Do you have electric scooters where you live?
449,Yes! It's a cheap and quick way to get to the office and around town. I work in real estate so there's a good amount of short distance travel.
449,That's nice. Have you sold any houses lately?
449,"I'm not exactly an agent, though I am responsible for listing and staging homes. Do you have any hobbies?"
449,I like to paint. Do you like art?
449,I enjoy watching art. Maybe I'll hapen across some of it!
449,You should try pottery. It is fun and can relax you.
449,"That sounds cool. My real passion is in singing, but it is just a hobby for now."
449,Do you ever do karaoke? I did it on vacation once. It was so embarrassing.
449,Only once at a wedding reception. I tried to do a CCR song. What did you sing?
450,well i was really tired after work since i work 5 days a week. and then i fell
450,I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any injuries?
450,my ankle hurts but i went to the doctor and they said it was fine
450,That's good. I am so mad at my coworker right now.
450,why? what happened with your coworker
450,She told my boss that I made a mistake when it was actually her mistake.
450,wow that's not good. did you tell your boss that she lied?
450,"Yes, but I don't know if he believed me. I can't prove it."
450,Thats not good i hope you can prove it :(
450,I hope so too. I work so hard there too. I'm sure not going to go the extra mile anymore.
450,thats a good thing though
450,"Yes, but why work so hard when my coworkers just get me in trouble?"
451,"oh just the basics. things like steak, specialty omelettes, etc"
451,I made omelettes for my family for brunch today with beaten eggs fried in a pan in butter.
451,that sounds just like what I do and it sounds tasty. Butter is one of the best fats to use for it.
451,i had leftover steak for breakfast ! I like meat for breakfast.
451,Now you're making me hungry. I have some beef I need to cook. A chefs gotta eat you know...
451,My love of eating lead me into wanting to cook more interesting and unique foods
451,There are all these exquisite recipes and cusines aren't there? it's amazing what is out there to cook and try. France has the best cheeses !
451,I don't know much of French cheeses. I really like Spanish cheese though. Very lovely sheep & goat combos from there.
451,Sheep and goat are interesting ones. They can be preferable to those with cow dairy issues. I love manchego
451,I discovered one called Payoyo actually here in the states where I live. Makes Manchego look like common cheddar 
451,Payoyo you say? I'll have to check that out. Sounds really tasty!
451,"hard to find, but if you're in a big city you may have much better luck. I'm not so lucky... I live in the boondocks LOL"
451,Good to know. Thank you and take care.
452,"It went great actually, she was very shy and blushed at me."
452,that's great. so glad it went well for you.
452,Thank you! me and her work in the same public affair building. And Iv'e had a crush on her forever. 
452,that is great . i wish things could have worked out like that for me .
452,Don't worry you will find someone some day! Just gotta keep looking and opportunity will come to you. 
452,thanks! i needed that. i just wish my family was that supportive.
452,"Oh that stinks, But hey you can do it I believe in you, Just be yourself and chat with everyone and get to know them. "
452,I'll try :) So what are you up to today?
452,"I'm just about to head out and build a snowman, I love this cold wintry weather, Its my fave!"
452,awesome ! i cannot wait for it to cool off !
452,Yeah this summer has been brutal. I am so ready for more snow and a warm cozy fireplace.
452,ah yes. curling up with a stiff drink and my pup.
453,"that's great, children are those things that makes you feel welcomed when you got back from work"
453,"Yup, I'm thinking about working at home depot with my dad soon. "
453,"Oh that's a good idea, working in the family business brings family more closer to each other "
453,"Home depot isn't really a ""family business"", but luckily for my dad his co-workers treat him like he's part of a family.  "
453,"oh that's okay, i thought it owned by your dad"
453,"Nah it's fine, maybe with his knowledge about home depot I can start one.  "
453,"hmmm, you really have a good sense of humor, that's a great idea"
453,"It wasn't really a joke, but maybe it is. "
453,No it wasn't 
453,"Yeah, I was being serious about starting a business with my dads help. Just floating the idea. "
453,"well i bet you it's a great idea, work it out. I bet you're going to enjoy it"
453,"Thanks, the details are a bit sketchy now, but I'm sure it'll come to me with time. "
454,Do you do any travel photography?
454,No I can't afford to travel
454,Even local stuff can be great.
454,"That's true, I live in a very beautiful place."
454,I hope to travel the world one day with my two dogs.
454,Do they let dogs on planes?
454,"Sure, most of the time anyhow."
454,What kind of dogs do you have?
454,They are beagles.
454,Oh how sweet. What are their names?
454,Kite and George
454,I like those names. 
455,yeah it happened when i was in class at college
455,I've lost my favorite cat before while in class too. I failed the test I had to take that day.
456,"Oh, wow!"
456,I always wear shorts everywhere especially when is sunning
456,"Yeah, that makes sense. "
456,"what about you, do you like wearing long or short"
456,"Usually long pants. I'm a night owl, so usually it's colder out when I go somewhere."
456,oh okay that makes more sense
456,"Yeah, also depends on the time of year."
456,that makes sense then yeah. During winter i also love wearing long
456,For sure. Wearing shorts in the winter would be cold!
456,haha i guess so . do you like winter ?
456,"Sometimes, I like all the seasons, but mostly warm."
456,"i bet , i prefer being warm"
457,what class was it that you failed?
457,It was in Marketing. I had the highest Grade Point Average in my graduating class.
457,oh wow. i would be better in college but i like to party too much
457,"I feel ya there. I forced myself to focus on my studies at the Culinary institute, but after I graduated I partied like crazy "
457,yeah i think everyone needs to go through the party phase before they're ready to grow up lol
457,"That is so true. Now that I'm a full time chef, I have no time to party any more."
458,"That's true, and I really don't care. I just want to find a good job."
458,I totally understand. Just keep trying and things will work out for you.
458,I hope so. I have two kids and my husband can't work. Do you have kids?
458,"No I don't, I'm very busy with my career at an accounting firm. "
458,Oh that sounds difficult. Are you a CPA?
458,"Yes, since i grew up as an only child, my parents really focused on me academically. I'm a whiz with numbers."
458,That's great! I wish I was better at math. Finding admin work is hard with everyone else looking too.
458,Yeah it's defintely a saturated market. Is there anything else you would want to do?
458,"I'd love to be a teacher, but going back to school for a new degree just isn't possible right now."
458,Have you thought about trying to be a subsitute teacher?
458,That's a good idea! Do they need special training?
458,"No, I think you just contact the school to see if you can be put on the list."
459,"I love the Beastie Boys, I listen to them while I train for wrestling. "
459,awesome! I remember when they released the first album back in 1986! good times. 
459,"Me too, although I hate admitting that I'm old enough for that though. "
459,"You are never too old to listen to them, they are timeless, they even play them on the radio today!"
459,"I know, but the play them on the ""classic rock"" channel, which makes me cringe.  "
459,"Haha yeah, That's just how it is, But you're only as old as you feel, age is just a number. "
459,"That's true, I try to exercise and maintain the physique I had in high school. "
459,"Me too!, Im out of shape now so I am training to be a museum curator though as that seems like an easy job."
459,"Oh that's interesting, I bet you learn all kinds of neat stuff being a museum curator. "
459,"Yes you get to see all kinds of new people and get to take care of different artifacts in the museums, neat stuff!"
459,"Well I hope it goes well for you, it's important to continue learning all throughout life. "
459,My motto is to just keep at it and I'll get better as I go! I should get the museum job in no time!
460,yeah what do you do for work? i am a vet
460,"That's pretty cool. I am a Pharmacy Tech, but I play on a minor league roller derby team, when I can get the time."
460,that sounds fun. how do you play in the derby?
460,"It's all about speed and resilience. Don't go down, and do your best to take them down. It's cut throat! Do you like sports?"
460,that seems really fun! i like to watch football and hockey mostly. 
460,oh that is cool ! i love sports too ! hockey and rollerblading are my favorites !
460,i even have hockey and football jerseys for my 3 dogs and 2 cats lol
460,So cute! You must be an animal lover too.
460,yes i am! how many pets do you have?
460,"None of my own, but I'm a cat uncle!"
460,that's cool too. what's the cat's name?
460,"Donald, not like the president. He's so cute!"
460,that'
461,"Oh, yeah the magic parts are good."
461,Yeah magic is pretty great!. I love science and fiction
461,"Me, too. Do you like cosplay?"
461,Yes I love the fact that there are always enough costumed entertainers
461,For sure! Costumes are fun. Have you been to any renaissance fairs?
462,What type of animals do you like?  
462,"I love all animals, but as far as pets my favorite would have to be cats and dogs, I currently have three cats."
462,Oh me too!  I love cats!  I have two of them.
462,"I just got my third, it was a gift for my son's birthday, it's the sweetest softest kitty ever. "
462,Mine are ages 6 and 2.  We've had them awhile.
462,"Two isn't that old, I bet they still act like a kitty once in a while.  I love when they run full speed chasing each other. "
462,He is pretty hyper; my other is not.
462,Are they indoor cats?  I live in a fairly rural area with lots of wildlife so I keep mine indoors. 
462,It is the same for me.  I worry about them.. So they stay inside.
462,"I had three dogs before, they loved it here cause I have a few acres they went nuts running on. "
462,"Our yard is not very big so we have opted for no dogs.  If we could live in the country, we would."
463,"So, do you have any children ?"
463,Oh god no.
463,I have 3. They're the best part of my life by far.
463,"I like kids, I just don't want any."
463,I was the opposite...I don't like kids...but I love mine.
463,"I work with teenagers at my job, thats my favorite age gropu"
463,"That's nice, what kind of work do you do with them?"
463,I am a substitute teacher for the county high schools
463,"Oh great, that's a wonderful job. How long have you been doing this?"
463,On and off for 3 years. It's hard to pay bills with.
463,Not regular enough ?
463,"Yeah there are a lot of breaks, no consistent hours, no benefits. I maybe make 250 a week"
464,"the beach is nice to visit, but living here would be a struggle"
464,Haha spot on man. I've been there like 5 times. It is a major city on the Atlanntic coast and a port city in south Florida.
464,I grew up on the beach but moved to Appalachia 12 years ago
464,oh boy ! i could not do that . my parents were cattle farmers ! you are so lucky 
464,I had to get away from the tourist based economy 
464,that is what i feel like is great about fl ! you can have it all ! what is your nickname by the way
464,Cecelia. Yours?
464,LOL! I love it! What a cute name. I might use that in the future. cutty
464,I love my name
464,LOL! I love it! What a cute name. I might use that in the future.
464,Thanks
464,you are welcome ! what do you have planned for the weekend ?
465,"Yeah! It was okay, but it didn't work out."
465,do those blind dates ever pan out ?
465,"Maybe for some people, I'm not sure!"
465,well theres only one way to find out!
465,haha Have you been on a blind date?
465,just once luckily it was not during a live performance . would have been embarrassed .
465,"Yeah, so what do you like to do for fun?"
465,Listening to music and playing board games. Like cavemen. Lol
465,Cool! I like horseback riding.
465,I've enjoyed going horseback riding a few times as a child. I remember thinking it was so cool that they could sleep standing up!
465,haha yeah!
465,ha hell yeah ! what else do you like to do
466,Oh definitely! I watch a ton of movies and one of my favorite movies is flashdance!
466,That is a favorite of mine too! Jennifer Beals was so good in it.
466,"Yes, also footloose was pretty good. But i wouldn't consider that break dancing."
466,I am ashamed that I am just now seeing it since dancing is my life. It is such a good movie!
466,Do you dance professionally?
466,"I do. I love it, but staying fit is tough. I had to cut out meat from my diet."
466,I work out a lot of i love to eat fast food so it messes up everything.
466,lol I know how that is. Taco Bell is my weakness. What do you do for work?
466,"I'm a stay at home mom, what about you?"
466,"I dance for a ballet company in New York. I don't have any kids, but I want them."
466,"I've always wanted to visit New York,it's so different then where I live  now."
466,"New York is very beautiful and the people there are very friendly, so i'm sure you'll do fine."
467,Exactly! I think many people fail to notice how beautiful the art of video games can be.e
467,"Indeed, Some games games are purposely designed to be a work of a persons creative expression, many though have been challenged as works of art by some critics."
467,Video games are undervalued by many and too easily blamed for problems like obesity or violence in kids.
467,"Indeed, Just last week my son was playing some Tine 2 and it was keeping him so calm. Games are therapeutic to some. "
467,"I use games to relax after a stressful day, the small escape is relaxing."
467,I enjoy a good gaming session after a hard day at work as well. 
467,What other hobbies does your son have?
467,"Well he likes to fly kites and collect bugs, typical hobbies for an 8 year old, lol. "
467,My 12 year old is into sports. Football mostly. I however don;t enjoy watching him play.
467,"I wish I could play football, But I wear this cateye glasses and they would break if I tried. "
467,Sounds nice. Are they new or vintage?
467,"They are new, I got them because of my love for cats lol. I have to show off my beautiful green eyes somehow."
468,They are so gross.  I don't like them in my kitchen.  
468,"they are so gross - they feed on skin flakes from people and pets, and sometimes mold."
468,"I love sitting on my couch at home and if gnats are flying around, it will bother me."
468,"Lucky you, I hate them because of their  ability to spray a liquid with a strong unpleasant smell."
468,What are your favorite foods?
468,Olives! And all the vegetables.
468,My favorite is mac and cheese.  All the carbs!
468,"Mmm, I love mac and cheese too. It's so good"
468,Yes it is.  I try to eat veggies too.
468,"Yes, some veggies on the side always makes me feel a bit better about being health conscious."
468,"I like olives too, but my husband hates them."
468,"Well I do appreciate your honesty. Perhaps you could help him by teaching him some Italian dishes, they are tasty after all."
469,omg that would hurt. i'm more of a dog person lol
469,I like dogs too but they're more responsibility than I'm ready for
469,yeah i have to always have someone watch my dog if i go out of town. they can't be left alone and are very needy lol
469,"Yes, and they're so loud"
469,yeah mine always barks when i'm trying to play video games
469,My neighbors dogs are so loud. I never want to be the kind of pet owner that makes neighbors unable to take a walk
469,"yeah that's true. or everytime someone knocks on the door, my dog goes crazy"
469,Horrible. I just am not interested in that kind of household
469,true that lol. do you have any other pets?
470,I used to swing dance. I wasnt any good
470,I am sure you are good at many other things though. Dancing isn
470,"Oh yeah, I'm a fiber artist"
470,That's interesting. I bet youre very talented with that art! 
471,I love to swim but the pools are always filled with kids and I can't stand them
471,they are the worst ! i can not deal with any kids and will never have any
471,"Yes, they are and I always have to act nice and I don't want to act"
471,its a lot of fun tho because i use to enjoy it
471,Yes swimming is a lot of fun. I need to find an adult only pool so I can start going again
471,just gotta be careful where you swim
471,I have taken classes and was on the swim team in school
471,"Good, remember to practice it all stages of life"
471,"I practice when I can, but like I said pools are always filled with kids"
471,I am sure there will be none of those there
471,They are always there. Hopefully not so many since school as started
471,yep i hope i never see one
472,"I love the arts, do you have any specific recommendations about the arts attractions in London?"
472,"Ive been to London and I saw 2 broadway shows. One was called ""Starlight Express"" and it was amazing@"
472,"That sounds like fun, I'll check that out if I go! Do you have any pets?"
472,Yes! I have a dog and 2 rabbits.
472,"That's awesome! I have two dogs. I love animals, that's why I became a veterinary assistant. "
472,Very cool. Do you treat a lot of rabbits where you work?
472,"We do!  For the most part, it's cats and dogs, but we will treat any animal. We even have a skunk patient!"
472,Oh wow. A skunk? That's crazy? Do they remove their scent glands or something?
472,"Yes, and after that, they are similar to having a cat. They can even be litter box trained."
472,That's cool. What do they eat? I feed my rabbits all kinds of veggies.
472,They eat vegetables and also meat. Rabbits are so cute when they eat!
472,Yes. Have you ever had rabbit stew ? You could make it with carrots a bunnies favorite snack.
473,"I have, but it's so hard to do."
473,I'm an accountant so I sit most of the day. I go to the gym just to be more active.
473,"I'm an artist, so as far from an accountant as you can get.  "
473,Well at least you probably love what you do...I'm kind of jaded.
473,"I do love being an artist, being able to express my creativity and get paid for it is the dream. "
473,I don't know if I love anything...maybe I should tap into my artistic side.
473,"There's all kinds of tutorial videos for how to do anything you can think of, just start with something that sounds interesting. "
473,How about you teach me to paint and I'll train you at the gym. Or do your taxes or something haha.
473,"Sounds like a deal, I'm horrible at doing taxes.  "
473,We can give each other more confidence where we need it.
473,"I like helping people release their creativity, we all have that inside of us, just have to tap into it. "
473,"Yeah, accounting is only creative when it's illegal lol. I think losing some weight might give you more energy to create even more."
474,"I'm being Zelda for Halloween this year, I can't wait."
474,"Zelda is one of my favorites ! It was published by Nintendo great action, adventure game !"
474,"I game a lot, do you play video games? "
474,I play online games.  What do you play?
474,"A little of everything, FPS, action, adventure, puzzle, RPG, I just love gaming. "
474,I like to play yahtzee online with people I know.  What is your favorite game?
474,"I used to play yahtzee with my dad, brings back good memories.  I don't know if I have a favorite, it really depends on my mood. "
474,Yeah I love the game!  My grandmother played it a lot with all the grand kids
474,"It's awesome how games can bring people together, although sometimes serious competition can occur. "
474,Very true.  Somebody has to win!
474,"I think playing games with kids is really beneficial cause it teaches them that concept, there has to be winners and losers, can't always be the winner. "
474,My daughter loves to play her Nintendo Switch and can be a sore loser sometimes.  I think we all can.
475,"Of course not, haha"
475,"Oh dear. Well, that does happen. Did you have any other clothes to change into?"
475,That'd be too convenient. No
475,some men like to change clothes multiple times a day anyway . lol
475,sounds like a lot of laundry
475,I dont mind laundry as long as i dont have to cook!
475,I dont mind doing laundry I just hate putting it away
475,shoot you aint the only one!
475,"Cooking isnt so bad, I love cooking for company"
475,Really? What sort of cooking do you like to do?
475,Crock pot meals
475,Yea i understand that. Nothing like a home cooked meal though.
476,I like writing and work in a publishing building right now.
476,That's great. What do you write about?
476,I like to write about travel and culture.
476,I also enjoy traveling!
476,Me too!  It makes work fun.
476,Nice! Have you ever had lasagna in Italy?
476,I have not.  I've not visited Italy yet.
476,I've had it once or twice when i went to visit.
476,"Nice, I'll have to remember that."
476,Lasagna has traditionally been ascribed to the city of Naples.
476,That's good information for an article.  Thanks.
476,You are welcome! What do you have planned for the weekend?
477,I have to have my wisdom teeth removed. I have all four of them.
477,I'm sorry to hear that.  Tooth pain is something awful to have to deal with.
477,"It sure is. I'll be glad when it's done, but the waiting and thinking about it is making me so anxious. "
477,"Yes, I'm sure it makes you anxious. But, no sense in worrying, it should go fine lol"
477,"Thank you, I hope so! What do you like to do for fun?"
477,"i love anything outdoors, i finally have free time since i graduated college a few years ago"
477,"Nice, congratulations! I like to go off roading, but I don't have a truck of my own. Hopefully someday I will!"
477,"oh that sounds fun ! though , i am more of a truck person myself. it's good for winter driving"
477,"For sure! I'm saving up for one, but it'll be a few years."
477,You definitely should. Saving should be a very important habit for every individual. You never know what could happen in life
477,"So true. I was lucky enough that I had some money saved for an emergency, so I can use it on my surgery tomorrow."
477,"That's true! i need to save more, i spend too much"
478,Nice. Do you catch a lot?
478,"Not as much as I would like, but isn't that always the truth.  I do it mostly because I enjoy it. "
479,Did you know that I have a pet husky?
479,I didn't know that. Husky's are so pretty.
479,"Yeah, they're beautiful. Do you have any dogs?"
479,"Yes, I do.  Currently I have a poodle. Do you have other dogs?"
479,Yes! golden retriever and a blonde lab. Have you played nintendo before? I love to
479,I have. I used to play Super Nintendo a lot!
479,"oh wow, that's awesome! I have a nintendo wii"
479,Nice. I used to have an old school nintendo set too.
479,"wow, what happened to it? Did you sell it?"
479,"Yeah, many years ago!"
479,"Ah, oh well. Maybe you can buy one again some day"
479,That would be cool. I used to like playing it while listening to country music.
480,Do you collect anything?
480,"Sometimes I do, I have an organized collection of watches in my glass case. "
480,That's unique. Never heard of anyone displaying watches
480,"its very uncommon yes, But I think that watches deserve to be shown in a case, not in a drawer."
480,I think its cool.  How many do you have?
480,I have too many to count. Probably 60 or more id say.
480,Thats a lot. I have probably got that many records.
480,"since records are so thin, you can collect tons of them and not take up much space. "
480,Yeah and they are so good for entertaining guests
480,yeah. that is very true . it also probably doesn't help that most record stores are going out of business. Which saddens me
480,I buy most of mine at flea markets
480,"flea markets are great!, Just last week I found a new cast iron skillet, Since I love to cook. "
481,"really, mine also!"
481,It's a great song. What about books? What's your favorite book?
481,I majorly read fashion related books and magazines. What's yours?
481,I am old school. I still really like the Twilight series lol
481,"lol, beautiful. "
481,ha ha ha.  Its a good book for sure!
481,"yeah, What about the movie?"
481,"The movies are okay, but the books go into a lot more details."
481,"Haha, definitely!"
481,So I just moved to Florida. Have you ever been?
481,"yes, beautiful place for vacation I must say."
481,What part have you visited?

482,"Wow, that's awesome. Where do you surf?"
482,on the beach in florida do you have in hobbies
482,"Oh wow, I'm in florida too! I've never surfed before but I love to look for shark teeth"

482,"Aw, that's so sweet. I hope to marry my college sweet heart. Do you do any gardening? "
482,yes love to garden how about you
482,"Yes, I love to garden as well! I actually have a really beautiful rose garden at home"
482,oh wow thats so awesome so do i. i love roses
482,"Yeah, Do you like the way they smell?"
482,yes love them
483,Maybe it was a typo and they decided to just roll with it.
483,"That could be, for sure. Kiichiro's dad ran Toyota Industries, so maybe they copied his company name."
483,"Maybe, not sure, either way its all very interesting. "
483,It seems Toyota is just the leader in the sales of the hybrid electric ones now - they encourage the mass market adoption of hybrid vehicles across the globe.
483,"I drive a big SUV, I've been wanting to get something more environmentally friendly but haven't had the funds to do so."
483,"I drive a Toyota Corrella which I love, but really want to get a truck"
483,"What kind of truck, my ex drives a huge GMC Sierra that looks really nice."
483,Not sure what kind yet just want something beside a car
483,"Well there's plenty of good options out there, have fun searching for something. "
483,Thanks you have any good ideas where I should start looking
483,"I would start on some car websites, carfax, autotrader, one that has reviews as well as prices."
483,ok i will have to check them out thank you hopefully I can find a good one
484,He was an amazing man but he died two years ago.
484,I'm sorry to here that. I bet you miss him. How'd he die?
484,He had Alzheimer's disease for 6 years and died when he was 82.
484,"oh wow, very sorry to hear that. Alzheimer's has often been referred to as the longest death. I hope you're doing ok now."
484,"Yes, it's been two years so I am doing better.  Thank you!  He was a farmer and very hardworking when he was younger."
484,That sounds like a lovely life to have led. We need more farmers these days. Hate to lose any.
484,He taught me to be independent and successful in any job I've had.
484,That is very respectable. I admire people that want to help others maintain a quality life. Sounds like he was a great teacher.
484,He was.  Tell me about your father.
484,"He's great. He had to slow down after a health scare recently, but he taught me my love of clay and is an artist himself."
484,I bet you both are great artists!  I have no artistic talent whatsoever.
484,"oh you don't need talent to play with clay ! practice, practice, practice makes the difference. My first sculpture was a tomato'ish thing. "
484,It was really nice talking to you!
484,same to you ! it was a pleasure .
485,"Yeah, it's terribly stressful but I've been praying about it. Where do you live? I actually live in the countryside"
485,I live in Michigan.
485,"Oh wow, michigan must be beautiful. What is it like?"
485,It's beautiful! It's the land of flowers.
485,"Oh wow, I need to visit sometime. Probably no flowers right now, now that it's almost winter."
485,"Yeah, not too many right now. Maybe you can go in the summer!"
486,"Oh, well. What do you do for work?"
486,I'm an athlete
486,Oh wow! That must be fun! What events do you do?
486,mostly weight lifting
486,"That's cool. I'm a freight truck driver. I'm a woman, so it can be rough at times."
486,"I totally understand, I'm also a woman. It's hard to be taken seriosuly."
486,"We both work in predominantly male professions, that's cool. I'm glad there are more women out there like me! "
486,It makes me feel powerful
486,"Me too, when I think about it. Hopefully, more women will continue to join ""male"" professions. "
486,Changing the narrative is important.
486,"For sure! Hopefully, in the future, there will be no such thing as ""male"" and ""female"" job stereotypes. "
486,That is certainly the ideal
487,It was really nice and it felt good to know that I was appreciated'
487,I'm sure it was fully deserved!
487,"I guess so. It's hard to retire after so many years, and I'm not sure what to do now."
487,"Well, what kind of work were you doing?"
487,I was a plumber. You get too old for that after a certain point.
487,"If I were in your shoes, I'd spend retirement doing volunteer work."
487,That's an idea. I do really good celebrity impressions. Maybe I could volunteer at a nursing home.
487,That'd be fun
487,"I think I'm pretty good, but I always wonder if other people think so or if they are just being polite."
487,Who cares what other people think
487,That's a good attitude at some times.
487,It's a good way to live
488,Do you believe in love?
488,"Yes, of course! I am in love right now"
488,That's great.  I have not had that opportunity so I don't really believe in it myself unfortunately.
488,I'm sorry to hear that. Are you married?
488,I'm not.   Do you have any hobbies?
488,"Yes, I have hoppies. I do yoga and I also hike. Do you have hobbies?"
488,I like to run and lift weights.  I do have an issue with shopping online.  Not sure you want to call that a hobby.
488,"Lol, that's awesome. I love to run and lift weights too! I wish I could pay for a gym membership but my family can't afford it."
488,They are extremely expensive.
488,"Yes, they really are. Do you have a membership?"
488,"No, I don't.  I would rather spend my money elsewhere."
488,"Yes, I agree with you. At least my hobby of hiking is free."
489,"Whenever I'm outdoors I love to go for runs, That's what I do after a long day at the office."
489,I love running but I prefer it on a treadmill.
489,"Treadmills are nice, But nothing beats the great outdoors. Just last week I saw a raccoon on my jog lol."
489,"This is true, but it gets hot sometimes. I'm a roofer so I'm always in the great outdoors!"
489,"Oh cool!, I bet you have a real good tan being on the roof all day long."
489,I try to wear sunscreen everyday. I don't want skin cancer!
489,Oh yeah that's a must! Gotta be safe out there!
489,Yeah for sure. I also love to have a beer after work to relax.
489,"Nice! Usually when I relax I like to sit in my beach chair listening to country music, which is my favorite thing to do. "
489,"Yes , however I prefer to listen to 90s easy listening."
489,"Ah yes! nothing beats some good 90's music. I listen to Keith Urban, hes been playing since the 90's. "
489,Yeah he's pretty good. I'm a big Journey fan myself.
490,She wants a divorce
490,"Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that.  Do you think you can work things out?"
490,She yelled at me and threw things at me. I'm not sure.
490,"That's awful, maybe after she calms down you can two can sit down and have a conversation. "
490,At least my garden keeps me calm.
490,"That's great! I wish more people would garden, so much healthier to grow your own food."
490,Yes I grow a few different vegetables and fruits.
490,"I wish I could grow stuff, I have the opposite of a green thumb, a black thumb if you will. "
490,You can always try again.
490,Do you have any tips on how not to immediately kill everything I plant? 
490,Try making your own soil out of food scraps!
490,that's a great idea ! i will have to try that .
491,how does that work?
491,"Lol, it's just a joke. I just really like to eat pizza. Do you like pizza?"
491,Of course! What's your favorite topping?

492,Oh yes.  Bill Gates stepped down as CEO in 2000 but is still chairman
493,"Ooh, I am really sorry about it. I hope you are getting over it?"
493,"Yeah, it's okay. I think that one day I can play internationally."

494,"Yes it will wash out, it will take a couple of washes though. "
494,"I could get onboard with that. I tried to dye mine once with koo-aide, didn't go well at all. What brand did you use?"

504,I'm a writer.  I always loved the stories my mom read to me which inspired me.
504,I am a vet tech myself. The equipment I manager keeps sick dogs and cats healthy!
504,Wow. I really admire peopel who put themselves out there to help animals.
504,It's tough but it's honest work.

504,Was he specialized by any chance?
504,He specialized in domesticated animal breeds.
505,Yes and the wind is horrible
505,"Oh, no! I like to take drives in the countryside, but not during a storm!"
505,My sister in law hates it when i bug her about the bad weather
505,"Oh, why does she get bothered?"
505,I think it is all of the botox treatments getting her jealous!
505,Oh! Do you have a lot of cosmetic treatments done?
505,"Yes, at least once a month. In fact I am due up for a treatment next week, have you tried it yet?"
505,"No, I haven't tried that. It's expensive. "
505,"No kidding and I have to save up extra cost each month, I think my sister in law hates that"
505,"Oh, I bet! I like to use my extra money to go out to eat with my family."
505,That sounds very nice and making me hungry! Have you had anything to eat today?
505,"No, I'm hungry but skipped breakfast."
505,"Well I am off to eat, great chatting with you."
506,I like country music too.  I actually like all kinds of music.
506,Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms that is what i like the most about it
506,I love that country music is like storytelling.
506,I have a job as a dj at a radio station
506,That sounds like fun!

506,That's good!  I'm glad you have a job that you enjoy.
506,"Me too! Same to you, thanks."
506,"Well, it's been really nice talking to you!"
506,You too! Thanks!
507,"Sounds like a downer, stopping love is never a good thing. "
507,That's true.  It definitely sounds that way.  Do you like to travel at all?
507,"I love to travel, but don't get to as much as I would like due to funds, time, the usual. "
507,I really enjoy traveling too.  It's fun but it can be expensive.  Where do you like to go to the most?
507,"I've only been outside the US on a cruise, so I'd love to travel anywhere outside of the US"
507,I've never on a cruise but I've always wanted to go.  Did you have fun?  I've been to Mexico and Canada - I'd definitely recommend both!
507,"Cruise was amazing, by far the best vacation I've ever had.  Relaxing yet energizing, never ending stuff to do, beautiful places, it was amazing."
507,I like relaxing vacations but sometimes I like to be a tourist as well.  Have you ever gone and toured in any museums?
507,"I haven't been to the museum in awhile, I should take my son to one this weekend."
507,They are a lot of fun. Cool to see all of the historic artifacts. I've got two full sleeves of tattoos and one is of an ancient Vikings artifact.
507,"That sounds very cool, I'd like to see it sometime. "
507,It's cool that we still name our ships and put dragon heads on them like back in the day.
508,Cool. Are you dating anyone or married or anything?
508,Nope. I am the only single one in my friend group. It's not that important to me at the moment though.
508,I think I might be single again soon. My girlfriend threatens to leave me on a daily basis.
508,"Keep strong friend, theres someone whos right out there for you, don"
508,"Thanks, bud! She has a problem with me not liking to wear pants at home. "
508,Ha! Would she rather you not wear them outside instead? Home is the place for running around without pants. Shes wrong to dislike it.
508,"Thanks, you're a good friend! What do you like to do for fun?"
508,"I am pretty boring. I like to read, go on weekend vacations to the beach and the mountains and sleep. Never enough sleep."
508,"Sleep is glorious! I like to read, too. What's your favorite book?"
508,"Black Sea !  Jane Austen is my favorite author, yours ?"

543,"I have not, but I've tried beaver before. Kinda chewy, not my favorite. What kind of foods do you like?"
543,I like seafood. 
543,"Yum, I like seafood too! Ever tried sushi?"
543,Yes I have it is okay
543,I enjoy the texture of the seaweed on most sushi but some don't care for it. I'd love to be able to visit Japan one day and get fresh sushi
543,Sounds great. I don't fully understand my feelings sometimes.
543,"That must be difficult for you, have you ever talked to a professional about that before?"
543,Yes in the past. I'm also unsure of who i'm attracted to.
543,"I'm sorry to hear you have to deal with such challenging circumstances, I hope things get better for you!"
543,"Me too, thank you, things always get better"
544,I just dabble in it I have to up to date on paramedic radio codes that have Java.
544,That's interesting. A lot of cool things to learn for sure. Is that part of your job?
544,I have to take an seat ni the comms link as the calls come in I input the codes in the record box.
544,is your position a call in type  where you get a chance to talk to people?
544,No I listen to had wield the hits with the patch in switch operator.
544,"Oh, ok. Sounds equally as interesting. Do you have any other hobbies that you dabble in?"
544,I mostly remodel my shabby studio apartment.
544,"I cant imagine living in a studio apartment. I like the look of them though, just to small for my family. What's the remodel entail?"
544,I would like an personal art paintgin area where I can have models with an backdrop 
544,That sounds like a fun project! How long have you been painting?
544,All my life inlcuding while not looking for other employment.
544,"Nice. I can't seem to stick with one hobby very long. I like the learning part, not the doing part so much."
545,I lost my faith when I found out that my parents were not my birth parents.
545,"Did you have a nice childhood though, even though you were adopted?"
545,It wasn't bad. It made me wonder a lot about my birth mother.
545,Did you ever get to meet her?
545,"I did, when I was 16."
545,did you two connect?
545,Not really. I think the only reason she agreed to meet was to ease her conscience.
545,"then perhaps it was for the best that you were adopted, you could find faith in that"
545,I lost faith because I found out the people that taught me faith lied to me for years.
545,"i am sorry to hear that, but maybe the fault lies with the people, not the faith"
545,"What can faith do for me, that it didn't do for them?"
545,"Hard to say, it does different things for different people"
546,yes the store is really making sense
546,Are the ones near you that primarily sells food? Or do they have other stuff as well?

546,Ok thanks 
546,Sure thing. Have a pleasant day.
547,I enjoy warm weather. 
547,Me too! I hate winter. Makes me very depressed and aggressive.
547,Me  too! There is so much more you can do when it is warm outside. 
547,I guess its different if you live where it gets cold during the winter. But there are places where it is always super warm.
547,Like Michigan!! Michigan gets below zero at times in the winter.
548,Agreed. Do you skydive?
548,I play the guitar
548,"OH wow, that's cool. I have a younger who use to play guitar hero and whatnot, lol. annoying, but hey."

549,"i know this might sound sappy , but taking nice long walks in the park. being around nature relaxes me so much."
549,"It is not sappy at all, its wonderful.  The outdoors and nature are two very good ways to clear the mind and relax.  "
549,"yes it does, its like i feel like a buhda monk after a nice visit to the park."
549,"Never underestimate the power of a visit to a park, more people should do this.  "
549,who you telling..do you like the dali lama teachings
549,"I don't know a lot about them, however; I am always open to learning about new things.  From the little I do know, it would definately be very interesting."
549,the ways of enlightment have many paths and reading up on him always calms my nerves
549,Thats great to hear!  Its so nice to speak to someone who seems to know themself so well.  
549,"knowing yourself is the first best thing to do. i forget where did the saying , know thy self come from"

551,I'd love to have a mother who could style my hair! That must have been nice growing up. How did you meet your partner?
551,Someone that used to hang around with an ex boyfriend of mine
551,"Hmm those must be interesting circumstances, did your ex boyfriend think it was strange you two getting together?"
551,"No, it was years later and neither of talk to the ex anymore"
551,Well that's good to hear. So do you have any pets?
551,"No, but I want a cat. The landlord won't let us have any"

552,"oh , yes . i wish i lived in a library ."

553,Do you think she enjoys her job? What do you do for a living as well?
553,I am a work-at-home customer service rep. nothing fancy. what do you do
553,"That sounds like an interesting job. I sell paper cups and plates to get by. It isn't great fun but it pays the bills, right?"
553,yes it does lol
553,So where do you live?
553,i live in Florida . you ?
553,That must be nice and warm. I'm in Utah. It's already snowed here just the other day!
553,I would love some snow right now lol It is 80 degrees.
553,I'll trade you haha! I'd love to not have to shovel my driveway. Do you get a lot of alligators over there?
553,Yeah we have a lot of swamps and gators but they aren't scary!
554,"I have been going since I was an child, very expensive to get sponsership."
554,That's for sure. You must be really talented to get one. Only the best players do.
554,I have had to pay almost 25 grand in coaching materials.
554,"Whoa, that's quite a lot. Does that mean that you coach a team?"
554,No as an prefessinal palyer the league will pay for only so much of your train.
554,Sounds reasonable. What else do you like to do?
554,"I am an anabolic dieter, my starch count leads to weight trianing."
554,Huh. That's quite the hobby. Does that mean you don't eat lutefisk?
554,"No, but somehow I hope to get an commercial deal."
554,"I have high hopes for you. It's too bad you don't get to eat lutefisk though, it's my absolute favorite."
554,I have been hearald about themas the rumor is that they bring radiation poisening.
554,"I've heard that too, but it seems like it would only happen in isolated cases. I make sure to buy my lutefisk from the atlantic, far from any nuclear plants."
555,I don't have one near me but I do have Starbucks which I love!
555,"Same here! Starbucks has over 23,000 locations. That's crazy right?"
555,That's a lot of locations but it's because they are so good!
555,"Oh yeah they are great! I also love their shakes and their soft drinks, especially their Coke."
555,"I love their frappucinos, especially the caramel one!"
555,I usually get a vanilla frappe. I love it so much
555,They are very fattening though!  I think that's what makes them so good.
555,"Yep, I think that's why they market themselves as a fast food company since its a quick fill up."
555,"I agree.  If I could afford to go their every day, I would!"
555,they're far less expensive than junk food. you won't regret the change!
555,That's true but I think I'd get a frappacino every day and gain 20 lbs!
555,"And there are so many junk food options that are quick but I still prefer real food, even if it takes longer to fix."
555,It was nice talking to you!
556,Ohhhhh. I've always wondered myself but never got the chance to look into it. Are you into country music?
556,I grew up listening to country music so I do appreciate the genre but it is not one I go out of my way to listen to.
556,Understandable. I can't get enough of it. I throw on my headphones when I go hunting and lose myself.
556,Where do you like to go hunting? Have you done any travel excursions for hunting?
556,Not necessarily. Sometimes I go up to my uncle's cottage up North and do my thing there. How about you?
556,"I have not traveled for hunting as we have a lot good sized game here. I have traveled for vacation though, I have been to Europe and Mexico."
556,Oh wow. I've always wanted to go to both of those places! How is it?
556,Mexico was great because I love spicy foods and Europe was increadible because of all of the history there.
556,Can't go wrong with spicy food man. Europe must have been beautiful. I wonder if there's any country bars there if they even listen to country at all!
556,I did not see many country bars in Eurpoe but there were quite a few when I was in Mexico!
556,Oh nice! Would you recommend them? I may have to go check it out one day.
556,"I definitely recommend them, they are quite fun, especially after some local tequila."
557,you are right but they have really good athletes
557,"yes, I think the best team won in the end, Croatia deserved their victory!"
557,its sad they couldnt win the world cup at the end against belgium
557,Oh well. Belgium is a good team.
557,"my favorite belgium player is hazard, whats your favorite player"
557,My preferred player used to be Neymar but I hated his behavior during the world cup.
557,"its true he kept faking fouls all the time, i thought brazil was going to win"
557,Thats too bad. Do you like animals?
557,"yeah sure, dogs are my favorite"
557,What kind of dogs do you like?
557,i have two pomeranians
557,What are their names?
558,"do you now, but bet you I can run faster than you."
558,I do.  And I would not be so sure about that!  You would be surprised.  
558,ha ha ha i've been told i'm the usain bolt female version
558,ha ha...thats great!! 
558,possibly one day me and you can have a race.
558,That would be great.  We'd have to come up with a prize.
558,"lets see what can it be, a medal or something"
558,A medal works perfectly.  It would look nice in my trophy case!!  ;)
558,your trophy case full of other gold medals or will this be the first.
558,"ha ha...no, this would be the 10th....no wait, 11th.  I may be old but I am tough!!"
558,"oh no i might just back out now, quick run..."
558,"haha... i'm not so old and feeble now, huh?  lol"
558,no you not
559,41
559,That's pretty cool to be 41. It is alot to teach school to 5th grade students. I bet he is busy with christmas coming up. 
559,"My father teachs also, at least in the since of very small young children."
559,I really like listening to music. How about yourself?
560,OK I love long hair on both genders. 
560,I can't hang long hair. I cycle a lot and it won't fit under the helmet as well. Bummer.
560,I love the way mine feels on my back in the wind. Is cycling your hobby?
560,Yes. I live a fairly active and healthy lifestyle overall really. How about you?
560,I like hiking and being outdoors. Anything to keep me from having to cook. I hate it.
560,LOL I hear that. Same. I eat a lot of raw carrots. Fortunately no cooking required.
560,Raw carrots are great for your skin. I eat salads and sandwiches regularly to avoid cooking.
560,"Good call. I do love a good salad. Weird to say it, but after a good long bike ride I kinda crave that kind of food."
560,Me too. It feels great to eat healthy after a strenuous activity. 
560,"Yup. Even stop and get the food while out biking. Two birds, one stone!"
560,Do you bike in the city?
560,"Not really. I like in a little more rural area, so getting to the city is a bit difficult by bike."
561,I want one too.  Are they hard to take care of?
561,"They can be a handful (literally!), but it isn't bad once you adjust to their smaller size."
561,"I see, how many pets do you have?"
561,I have one other dog which is a pomeranian. Do you have any pets?
561,I used to have a poodle but he recently passed away.
561,That is sad to hear. I am sure they will be remembered fondly.
561,Yes but I miss having a pet. Would you recommend a pomeranian or Yorkies?
561,"I think a pomeranian might be a little easier to take care of, so long as you can tolerate their tiny little barks."
561,Thank you for letting me know.  Where are you located?
561,On the east coast. There are just too many good opportunities here that I'd lose elsewhere. What about you?
561,"I'm in LA, near the ocean."
561,"I've been over to San Francisco for a competition, but haven't made it to LA. I'd like to see it one day."
562,I love video games. Did you listen to music at all?
562,"No, I don't listen to too much music. I watch TV. I like watching series."
562,Me too. The office is my favorite. I am going to a concert this weekend. where should I buy new clothes
562,You can try Thrift stores. That's where you find the real bargains
562,I was thinking about American Eagle. Have you been there? 
562,American Eagle is my favorite store. You can get anything you like there at reasonable price.
562,I know right. It's great to buy winter gear for when I go up north. me and my girlfriends love it. 
562,"i've been shopping at american eagle for tens years now too! I love to go running, so I buy my gears there"
562,Do you just run or do you do other exercises? 
562,"yes, I do weight training and fitness walking.Do you do other exercises too?"
562,I go skiing. And play other sports but not direct exercise.
562,"I can understand that, besides skiing anything else you like?"
563,I like the Rambo movie.
563,Rambo is awesome. What do you like about the movie?

564,"Yeah, mine is pretty random too. I mainly workout so I can eat what I want. I love cooking, esp breakfast foods. Do you cook much?"
564,Every night if I didn't my family would go hungry as no one else wants to do it...lol
564,"Same here! It's tough to come up with new ideas, esp my daughter only seems to want pasta every night and I'm not a huge fan of cheese."
564,My youngest all I hear is I want a happy meal. I'm like you can't eat that every day
564,I try very hard to not do the drive thru thing. But some nights it's tough with homework and after school activities... How old are your kids?
564,They are 4 and 10 and yours
564,"I just have 1, a 9 year old daughter. She's in 4th grade. "
564,"Fun, both mine are boys"
564,"Each presents their own challenges. I bet with 2 boys it can be chaos. Girls are more emotionally complicated, esp tween years. Should be fun..."
565,"was angry feel like I was cheated on,."
565,"So like I was saying, i can never have enough dogs. "
565,dogs at your house?
565,"Yes. Good thing I'm a homeowner. My dogs are a bit noisy at times, but I love them."
565,"i don't have space for dogs, how many have you got."
565,I have five at the moment. Do you have any pets at all?
565,"no pets, you got five how do you manage, that should keep you busy."
565,"It can be a bit much at times, but it's better than when they were puppies. "
565,and I thought puppies were better than bigger dogs.
565,LOL. I guess it depends on the breed. Or maybe I'm lucky.
565,or maybe you just a dog whisperer if there's anything like that
565,Haha. I have been told that I'm good with dogs. 
566,I love shopping do u like it?

567,"That's ok, better with practice. Do you like beans? Are you a vegetarian?"
567,I am not a vegetarian but I do enjoy beans sometimes. I find it difficult to be vegetarian as the diet is very limiting.
567,"Yes, I love beans and their smell. I'm not a vegetarian though, I like meat lol. That diet is limiting, I agree."
567,What are your favorite type of beans? My family use to grow soy beans on our farm when I was younger.
567,"That 's cool too, kidney beans are my fave."
567,Kidney beans are good but I prefer baked beans. What is your favorite meal?
567,Fave meal is sushi.
567,"I just recently got into sushi. So many new flavors and combinations, I wish I had discovered it earlier in life!"
568,I prefer to drive my corvette but it's nice to walk where I live in California.
568,i also have a corvette it is very speedy and efficient
568,And good at attracting attention! 
568,right very dependable car and great for taking trips to the beach
568,Are you from California also or another coastal state?

569,Of course!! So happy to hear you are safe.  
569,Thanks are hurricanes an issue where you are?
569,"No, not too bad.  We have had a few storms that were intense, but we are not in a location that gets many hurricanes."
569,That's good. I'm a biker and you can't ride when it's stormy especially hurricanes so I really don't like them.
569,Oh that would make biking difficult for sure.  
569,"My cousin in WA state got snow 2 mornings ago, luckily it probably wont snow here for a couple months"
569,My friends in Alberta got 3 feet last week.  Ugh!!
569,"Oh wow, I'm ready for hurricanes but not snow!"
569,"you and me both....i'll take rain over snow any day, you don't have to shovel rain!! hehe"
569,"Yes, exactly! I can leave whenever I want in rain just might regret it but it's an option"
569,"Very true, i fully agree!!"
570,"No, but I bet she was mad when she did realize!"
570,"Probably, since that is how they make their living, you could always go back and bring the tip?"
570,I don't go into town often as I run the family farm. Next weekend for sure. You ever done that?
570,"No, i have been a waitress at one point so i know how important tipping is, what about you, what do you do for a living?"
570,I run my family's farm. It's a dairy farm and takes up a lot of time. What do you do now?
570,"i work at a factory, running a farm sounds a lot more interesing haha"
570,"Well, there's never a dull moment, for sure. And in some weathers I think I'd prefer to be in a factory, lol."
570,"true, at least we work under a roof lol, how early do you have to get up every morning?"
570,"I'm up at four am, seven days a week. You get used to it. That's probably why I forgot to tip the waitress - exhausted!"
570,"that would be a good reason, so i am sure she will forgive you when you bring her the tip"
570,Hopefully. What type of factory do you work in?
570,"It is basically just an assembly plant, my volunteering work is a lot more interesting"
571,"It was a little more realistic, but they did give free chocolate to me and my boys. They really loved it."
571,I would imagine they loved that!
571,Yes they really did. We plan to go again.
571,what was your favorite part about it ?
571,Eating all the chocolate of course! 
571,I understand. We need chocolate in life!
571,"Yes, chocolate and my man Justin Beiber."
571,"Justin Beiber has been a popular musician for quite a while now, not a huge fan tho. But he is a talented singer and songwriter."
571,He is my favorite artist. Me and my two sons can't get enough.
571,how old are your sons ?
571,7 and 10.
571,That is so neat.  Are they at the age that they like the Australian Band Hi-5?  My kids love to binge watch their show!
572,Good call. I love a good pattern. I paint a lot so I love playing with different patterns.
572,That's great! I take art class in school and it's my favorite subject.
572,Fun! what is your favorite thing to paint?
572,I love doing portraits of people. It's fun and challenging to try to capture their spirit in the picture.
572,Agreed. They can be hard though. Congrats on enjoying those. I like more organic scenes. Lots of trees and greenscapes.
572,I love to look at a landscape picture. They can be very soothing. Is painting them soothing as well?
572,"Of course. It's my job, but it's also my therapy."
572,"Oh, so you paint professionally? I would love to do that, but I'm afraid I could never make a living at it."
572,"It can be hard sometimes. Money is hit or miss, but I wouldn't have it any other way."
572,I guess you really have to follow your dream and be prepared to endure hard times. I admire your passion!
572,For sure. Some months are better than others that's for sure.
572,So do you have your work in any galleries?

573,I bet they are! Do you make fitness clothing or more stylish?
573,"Stylish , I have never tried making fitness clothing, I will try it someday."
573,i am sure you will love it ! good luck !
574,"I know my trade just enough, the side deals to export the good are the most demanding now days."
574,Do you like Mexican style foods?

575,That's a lot. I'm a musician so I don't work out nearly as much as I should
575,You are into music. Wow that's great. I had interest once but I didn't follow it
575,"Aw, I've been playing violin for a long time now. What was your interest?"
575,I play guitar. I love playing it
576,do you bake the cakes also or its just decorating you do.
576,"I mostly decorate them. But if I have to, I bake them as well. "
576,thats good i need a cake for my birthday
576,I think birthday cakes are my favorite when it comes to decorating.
576,i need a pink one with flowers
576,LOL. That would be easy. Baking cakes for pets is hard. Do you have any pets?
576,"no I do not have pet, oh my you actually bake cakes for pets really?"
576,"Occasionally. I have cats that are like my children, so I make birthday cakes for them."
576,"I have never heard of cakes for pets, this is a first"
576,"I know it sounds strange, but it's becoming more popular among pet owners."
576,"that sounds great, a good way to celebrate your loved pet"
576,"Yes, I really love my cat babies. LOL"
577,wow i love violins! do you play professionally?
577,"No, not professionally. Although I have been in many competitions."
577,wow that's really cool. id like to pick up an instrument but college is tough.
577,"Yes, it is. A clarinet is another good instrument. My older sister plays the clarinet."
577,i admire the level of talent your family has. its a very unique skill
577,Thank you. I wish I could play professionally. But I have placed in some of the competitions I was in.
577,"That's cool, im more of a technical person so i guess my violin would be computers."
577,"That is cool, too. You can actually learn how to play the violin from the computer."
577,Really? Have you ever done it
577,"No, I have not personally. But, I know a few people that have learned that way."
577,Wow cool how the technologies collide. Ill have to check that out.
577,"Definitely! Also, my sister has learned a few new songs and a few tricks from lessons on the computer with her clarinet."
578,"Well i dont have to have the job yet, i just want to act with animals"
578,"oh ok, I understand. What else do you like to do? I like going for runs."
578,"i am pretty open to everything, as long as it is not on the beach, i dont like the beach"
578,There's more stuff to do than the beach though so you'll be good. Do you like singing?
578,"yes i like to sing, is that something you like to do?"
578,I really enjoying singing. It's a passion of mine!
578,What kind of music do you like to sing?
578,"Rock music, Something from Scorpions, or Aerosmith, it sounds great on acoustic guitar, I like vibrations."
578,"i like rock as well, so are you in a band?"
578,"yes, I'm a guitar player and lead singer. It's fun multi tasking."
578,"is it really hard to do, sing and play guitar at the same time?"
578,"Yes, but not impossible. I sometimes messed up but don't we all?"
579,"I would use bug spray, but it makes me cough."
579,"Yes it does do that sometimes. Being married and have little ones, we use alot of bugspray"
579,I have two golden retrievers that sleep with me and don't want to expose them to bug spray.
579,"That is good. Bug spray can sometimes hurt pets and not always good for them. Working for a big law firm, I have seen cases like that."
579,"My father is a lawyer, and his parents met while working for the circus."
579,That is really cool. I really enjoy going to the circus. I like the clowns.
579,"Clowns scare me, which is ironic because my grandparents were clown in the circus."
580,Aw I love Florida. Basically anywhere I can scuba dive really.
580,"I have never been to Denver, i hear it is beautiful there!"
580,Denver is beautiful. Do you ski?
580,"I used to, a very long time ago!"
580,Yeah guess it gets harder on the joints as you get older. That's why my wife and I love scuba. It's not very physically demanding.
580,"Never been scuba diving, but i have done snorkeling."
580,That's fun too. You should give it a shot sometime you are in Florida.
580,"Yeah, i should!  I hear it is very expensive hobby though?"
580,It can be if you want to own your own stuff. But you can always rent and it's not too bad.
580,That's cool!  I would have to take lessons too i am sure!
580,Yes I would definitely recommend it.
580,Yeah... don't need to be drowning or having the bends!
581,sounds nice i live in a somewhat rural area i suppose. Do u?
581,"No, I live in a very small city.  "
581,Thats a nice way to live too
581,"It is lovely, my only complaint would be that everyone knows everyones business hehe"
581,Ah yes thats always so not fun lol
581,"I agree, and for this private person who isn't nosey, it can be a challenge some days."
581,I agree I like to be alone a lot too
581,Its nice to enjoy your own company.  I like that too.  What do you do for fun?
581,I cook I love pasta in all shapes and forms
581,Yum!  Pasta is my favorite.  I like to cook too.  I love just randomly finding new recipies.  Some work/some dont!  live and learn
581,Yes Have u ever made ur own pasta?
581,"no, is it hard to do?  What is the difference between homemade pasta and store bought?"
582,good to hear. i love to do saving for college. i am same character like you
582,Yes she wants to do some form of counseling. The mind to her is very interesting
582,really interesting character and it works well in this way. you keep move forward with the spirit
582,My dad is a journalist for the NY Times? Anything interesting about you?

582,Yes. Do you like art?
582,yes i do like art. i like specifically dance and singing .. how about you
582,I do love to sing
583,"Mainly legal thrillers, but I also like biographies. Do you like to read?"
583,I read a lot of blogs. I like sharing and hearing others opinions on topics.
583,"Yeah, that's interesting and informative. I kind of like to keep to myself, so books are good for me. Do you work?"
583,Right now I am working with several publishers to get my first book made.
583,"Wow, I'm impressed!! What is your book about?"
583,"Right now, about nutrition. Have you heard of Lord Peter, the detective?"
583,"No, I haven't. Is he a nutritionist? Are you?"
583,A amateur one from reading blogs and consulting with dietitians for publishing my book.
583,That's so exciting. Nutrition is such an important subject and I don't think people pay enough attention to it. Good luck!
583,Thank you very much. Much success to you! What do you do?
583,"I'm an attorney, but am thinking of becoming a caddie as I prefer golf to the law!"
583,"I really don't know much about golf, but I;m intrigued by why so many people love it."
584,What type of food is served at your nightclub?
584,Chicken wings and shrimp and of course hamburgers
584,Those are my favorite foods. I bet you get a lot of business.
584,We do since we're there so late at night
584,I would like to experience it. When is the next night with a DJ?
584,"Tonight, I'm excited because he's doing a Pearl Jam night"
584,We don't have Pearl Jam in my country. What is it?
584,The're a famous American band from Seattle
584,I am excited to go tonight. It will be a first for me.
584,"Me too, I think it's going to be a great show."
584,How much does it cost to enter the nightclub?
584,It's $9 per person or $17 for a couple
585,Yes I was very happy! I was tired of seeing the Patriots win all the time.
585,"I agree! I'm traveling right now and football isn't big here, but I try to keep up."
585,"Oh, that's cool. Where are you traveling to?"
585,"I'm in Japan currently, but I'm not sure how long I'll stay. I tend to roam wherever the urge takes me."
585,I've never been there before! What is it like?
585,"Oh, I love it. It's the best of both worlds. The city is busy and loud, always something to do. The rural parts are just idyllic."
585,It seems like a neat place to be. What are some of your hobbies?
585,"I love traveling, of course. Cooking, reading, hiking, anything outdoors, really. I also love dancing. What about you?"
585,"I love playing sports, especially soccer. I also like to hang out with friends and go to the beach."
585,That sounds fun! I love a good beach as well. What's your favorite spot?
585,I like laying on the sand and feeling the sun on me.
585,"There's nothing more relaxing, that's for sure!"
586,It did. That always takes so long.
586,Was it an important appointment? It sounds like it was.
586,"No, just new paperwork because I switched doctors. Guess it is better than being at home and having to clean up after my husband and children. I hate that!"
586,Haha yeah being left a mess is never a good thing. Especially after filling out paperwork.
586,Exactly! As I was waiting to be called back at my appointment I caught an interesting TV episode on aliens. Do you believe in aliens?
586,"I do, but I never really think about them. I do love green things so they're ok with me."
586,"I believe in aliens, too. Interesting subject for sure!"
586,Have you ever seen a UFO before??
586,I have! What about you?
586,Certainly! But I live near an air force base so you never know if its one of ours.
586,"True. And, the universe we live in is pretty big and I am certain these things are out there!"
586,It's very humbling to think about it in that context.
587,Thats really sad. it sounds like a hard life
587,"It was, but it made me a strong person. I didn't want it to shape my future."
588,It was. I brought some pita bread with me to much on too. I love pita bread!
588,"I like pita bread too, but I love that naan flat bread even better. Garlic flavor"
588,I love to have hummus with my pita bread also. You like hummus?
588,not really. The flavor isn't to my liking much. Do you go to the park a lot?
588,Sometimes. It depends on what mood I'm in being bipolar in all. Luckily the meds are helping with that.
588,Bipolar is really a tough disorder to deal with. I think being outdoors would help a lot. And taking time for just yourself.
588,"Yeah, it does. I think I finally found the right combo of meds to take to help it though. I do like taking in nature though."
588,Getting the right med combination is a real struggle. I hope what you have continues to help.
588,Thanks. I really appreciate that a lot. 
588,I actually know what it's like to have to try a ton to find 2 that work. Medication and meditation help. And my dog.
588,"Yeah, I have a pet cat that I love a lot that helps with that. I also enjoy reading too. That's my way of meditating my mind I guess."
588,I was going to say that next. Reading is a great way to get your mind off life and the everyday stresses.
589,I am a student right now. So we are on opposite ends of the spectrum!
589,Seems so!  What are you studying?
589,I am a business major. Hopefully I'll go into some kind of management role at some point.
589,"Thats fantastic!  A good business education can help you go far, in so many different fields.  "
589,For sure! What do you enjoy to do in your non-work hours?
589,I am actually in a band :)  I sing.
589,Oh that's fun! What kind of music?
589,"Its hard to catagorize my music.  I guess pop/jazz ...hehe, sorry, we do not fit into one category.  What are your hobbies?"
589,Understandable. I get that. I love to play tennis in the little spare time I have.
589,"Tennis.  I'm jealous.  That is one thing I am not, sporty.  I am as clumsy as they come.  Thats really cool!"
589,"Oh I'm definiately clumsy. I'm not good, but I enjoy it."
589,"doesn't matter at all....do what you love.  Life is short and you should spend it on whatever makes you happy.  And hey, clumsy is charming!!"
590,I am from Indiana. I don't like standing in the rain but sometimes get stuck in the rain when walking the dogs.
590,I'mm in colorado and I love standing in the rain
590,"I know, you told me previously. I am a librarian, do you enjoy the library?"
590,"Sorry, I did tell you that. I do read occasionally work keeps me busy"
590,I do understand that it gets harder to read the more busy you are. What is your occupation?
590,I work with kids. I'm a high school math teacher
590,That is a respectable career. I believe teachers need to be paid way more than what they currently do.
590,Thats exactly how I feel. Some teachers seems like they just want the check and wee all know teachers don't get paid much.
590,The starting salary around here is about 35K/year which is not nearly enough for what some of them put up with.
590,"It is about the same here. Yes, the stuff you put up with sometimes is crazy"
590,How long have you been teaching?
590,"About 5 years now I enjoy, but trying to go to school to do something else. Hard to each and go to school yourself"
591,Yea but she told me the wrong items so now I have to go back out again.
591,oh wow... why did she tell you the wrong items?
591,she wanted different stuff. U know how kids r.
591,Kids can be annoying
591,boy do I know it. How many do u have/?
591,I have two girls!
591,Nice I do too
591,my daughter is seven today
591,thats nice I hope she has a good birthday. R u having a party for her?
591,"oh yeah, we have like 150 people coming to her bday tomorrow"
591,wow thats gonna be a busy day I hope she loves it
591,"Oh she better love it, especially with all the presents she will get!!!"
592,I prefer Dr. pepper. We call it soda in the country. You say soda or pop?
592,That is one of my favorite drinks. I like to say soda. I even have a can from my favorite superhero(superfans). Its pretty cool
592,That's neat. The only time I collect cans is if I need them to get a discount at the state fair.
592,I really like state fairs. Last time I drive my toyota there. Really the only kind I like to drive. 
592,I have a blue Subaru myself. I love the color blue.
592,Blue is one of my favorite colors. My favorite color is purple thou. My toyota is colored blue.
592,I guess it would be hard to find a purple toyota. I like to drive to the city near me sometimes.
592,You could always have it painted by someone. 
592,"The car? Yep, but you have to be sure they do a good job or it'll end up peeling and fading. Yuck."
592,"Yes, you do want the paint to come off. My toyota has a purple paint job. "
592,"That's funny because my 2 favorite colors are red and blue, so that makes purple. Cool."
592,Those are great colors to blend and mix the colors with. 
593,she has an implant and shes great with flowers
593,atleast she doesnt let the loss of hearing bother her
593,"no she does not, she's an inspiration"
593,"i can imagine, what about you, what do you like to do?"
593,"I'm an engineer, how about you?"
593,"i just graduated from college, so what kind of a job do you have as an angineer?"
593,"mechanical engineer, so have you got a job yet just from college"
593,"no not yet, right now im just taking some time for myself, i hike alot"
593,"thats interesting, enjoy yourself when you start working there won't be a lot of time for that"
593,"thanks, i am sure you are really busy with your career"
593,"oh yes, but will be going on holiday soon with the family"
593,"thats awesome, where are you going?"
593,australia
594,yes  i would need to do 
594,"YES, do that. I'm tired of people. I'm having a party soon, for Halloween and I am the one always buying the beers."
594,oh great. can i join you by the way. 
594,"Sure,lol. My beer gut is huge I haven't seen my feet in years, lol."
594,lol.. you have good humor sense. keep it go
594,"Thanks, lol. What are you being for Halloween?"
594,i would be joining with my aunt family and celebrate it well. i do dress myself and make people happy. what you do basically ? 
594,Dress up. Last year I gave our candy. This year I'm hosting a Halloween party/ b-day bash.
594,wow. give me a pass to join with you guys. it would be wonderful to celebrate among the crowd
595,My twin brother is a Best Buy employee and brings home used games sometimes.
595,my brother is employed at best buy too. it does not run in the family. We don't talk much.
595,We are Canadian and hope to move to the US soon. 
595,Oh that sounds really nice. I'm from the Midwest myself (Iowa).
595,Do you enjoy it? I imagine it quiet and open spaces like Canada is.
595,Actually it's way too quiet and boring. I want to move but I'm too poor at the moment.
595,You should work at Best Buy like our brothers. Maybe you will enjoy it.
595,Maybe. Retail work isn't for me. I shouldn't be picky though!
595,What about moving here to Canada. Lots of jobs and thriving cities!
595,That should be awesome. Do you know many people in Canada?
595,We have a small circle of close friends. No family left here. They're in Italy.
595,Wow! Have you been there before? They have an amazing culture.
596,I work at a music store.
596,That's got to be a great job! a lot of clubbers I know do that too.
596,Yeah it's great to get free music and listen to it all day.
596,What hip hop artists do you like to listen to?
596,"Jay-Z, J. Cole, Travis Scott are a few."
596,J Cole is very talented. I goto a lot of shows but I've never seen him live. Have you?
596,Yeah at ACL. He's amazing.
596,That's great! Do you listen to any other genres at all? I'm mostly a club banger person.
596,Some electronica and Jazz. Grew up listening to Jazz with my Dad.
596,That is very eclectic but very cool too. Do you ever listen to those old jazz records?
596,Yes. I still have several of his.
596,"It's good to hear that kind of stuff in a more ""pure"" form."
597,thats one of the first places im going with my friend from college
597,I'm jealous. I think it will be amazing and I think you'll have great fun there soaking up the culture and wine also I suppose.
598,That's true. I actually work for a railroad. So that is kind of up my alley.
598,i like trains i use live by tracks so i saw them all the time
598,They can be loud and annoying to live near.
598,"Sometimes, but they're such fun to watch. There's something exciting about getting on a train - not like driving in my old van!"
598,"LOL true. The work is hard, but at least it pays well."
598,It's good that you have a well paying job. I'd like to be a train driver one day - sounds like fun.
598,"Well good luck! Conductors can take a while to work up to, but definitely pay well once you do."
598,Thank you! There's an English rock band called I Like Trains - they're pretty good.
598,That's neat. I do enjoy some good rock.
598,"I also love folk rock like the Beatles, there's so many great old bands out there."
598,For sure. England is rich with music history.
598,"It sure is. Amazing that such a small country can produce so many amazing musicians. Must be something in the water, lol."
599,That sounds great. I like that no animals are ever killed. I I volunteer at a local animal shelter.
599,I'm glad you can do what you're passionate about.  What kinds of animals do you rescue?
599,"Dogs and cats mostly, but anything that comes along we try to help. We had an injured skunk once!"
599,That's pretty cool. I really like skunks; I desperately want one as a pet despite the risk of getting sprayed.
599,"I think if you treat them right they wont spray you, just like a well looked after dog doesnt bite. What do you like other than animals?"
599,"I enjoy gardening in my free time, mostly. Yourself?"
599,"I like most sports, but football is my favourite. Do you grow vegetables in your garden or is it just flowers?"
599,"Predominantly flowers. I grow a few herbs, but no traditional vegetables."
599,"That must be very satisfying, I am not green fingered at all! Are there any sports you like?"
599,"Not particularly. I follow the NFL and NBA a little, but that's mostly because of my brother."
599,"Yeah, I support my team beause of my older brother.  Which team is nearest to you?"
599,"We're from New England, so despite not living there he's all about the Patriots and the Celtics."
600,"Oh wow, I'd love to see that show. I bet it was fantastic."
600,It was amazing... one of the best shows i have ever seen!
600,Did you like the live action Lion King movie? I actually haven't seen it yet.
600,Actually i have yet to see it!  And to be honest not sure if i really want to.
600,"Me either, I've heard it's not as wonderful as everyone thought it would be."
600,well... it's not really live action when the entire movie is animated
600,Very true! I can't get past the real-looking animals talking.
600,oh yeah.... that is a wee bit creepy... LOL
600,"I did like Aladdin, though. Will Smith as the genie was actually funny. Not sure he could top Robin Williams, but still good."
600,oh gosh... i havent even seen that one :(
600,I just saw it recently! I wasn't expecting much but I liked it.
600,Did you see Dumbo?
601,Exactly! It's way better to just be genuine
601,"Sometimes, it is best to be that way.  "
601,"Really I think it's always best to be that way, don't you?"
601,No I really dont. I don't have much energy to deal with that anymore. 
601,"What, so you just fake your personality now?"
601,What plan's do you have for today? I have to clean. I really enjoy doing that
601,"I'm just working today, then I need to go grocery shopping "
601,I like going grocery shopping. I enjoy making lists. 
601,I don't really. I usually end up buying a bunch of random stuff haha
601,That is why it is best to make a list. What kind of random stuff do you buy?
601,Whatever looks good really. I can't resist new meat substitute products.
601,There are so many different kinds. I like shopping at Fresh Market.
602,"I think I travel a lot to to keep my mind occupied, I'm a bit of a nomad."
602,I'll have to try that because I just can't get in touch with my emotions doing regular things.
602,"Yeah, you don't get into a rut when you're always moving. I'm actually in Japan at the moment."
602,That sounds like fun. But what about mornings? Are they hard for you too?
602,I look forward to the day when I travel...knowing I have new experiences ahead of me.
602,I hope travelling will help me deal with mornings better than i currently deal with them. It's tough.
602,"Yeah I hear you, that's why I had to take this journey. I had many mornings at home that I had trouble getting started."
602,I don't even remember when I started having trouble waking up in the morning.
602,"That's why I have been travelling, it makes every day memorable...like I'm going to see Mt. Fuji today!"
602,That's awesome! I've always wanted to see Mt. Fuji.
602,"Japan is pretty peaceful, I hope someday soon you can come here and get a break from what you're dealing with."
602,I would love that. I'm sure it would help me.
603,Yes we finally made it after a few wrong turns haha
603,"Aww, shucks. I'm sure he drove around his share of both! I bet he got to meet many different kinds of people."
603,"I met quite a few interesting people in my youth aswell, i was quite the wild child"
603,I think my dad's favorite part was getting to see Jimi Hendrix perform on guitar. My mom's favorite part was meeting my dad!
603,Do you like music as well? like your dad?
604,I wonder what it would be like being the other gender?
604,i sometimes think of what it would be like to be a different gender
604,I agree! Do you date or are you married to anybody?
604,"seen like dated? no, I have been married for over 7 years and we were highschool sweethearts"
604,Aww that's so sweet. I hope to find that someday but I'm never sure if I'm attracted to anybody or not.
604,"not every person in the world is the same, we are all different I am confident you will find someone."
604,Wow that was so deep! Are you a philosipher?
604,No I am not. Why do you ask?
604,Because you have some deep thoughts going on!
604,Excellent!  Those thoughts are beautiful.
604,What's up for the weekend then?
604,"I'm just hanging out enjoying the weather, don't really like fireworks much. I might go out for dinner, what about you?"
605,"Most definitely, I like that type of rap too, more old school then new school."
605,"I definitely remember all the outrage when gangsta rap got really popular, thanks to Ice-T and N.W.A.  People were so shocked!"
605,"Yeah, speaking of that, you watched straight outta compton?"
605,"I have, yes!!"
605,"Yeah, it was a fantastic documentary, another one I might suggest is The Defiant Ones, its on HBO, 4 parts, you really have to watch it, if you haven't already.."
605,"I'll have to check it out, thanks for the rec! I've been meaning to add more things to my "
605,"its to do with Jimmy Iovine, how he started and recruted Dr. Dre, how Dr. Dre recruited Eminem, and how they founded Beats and so on. REALLY nice."
605,Oh thats really cool.  Definately one i'll have to check out.  Any other recommendations?
605,"Uhh, I love nature documentaries too, I love animals in general, so, Planet Earth, Blue Planet and so on, narrated by Sir David Attenborough, those are fantastic. "
605,Oh wonderful!  I love that there are so many documentaries on Netflix.  Never a chance to get bored.  I love the nature ones too!
605,"Yeah, really gives a perspective to the whole world that we live in. Do you have any recommendations?"
605,"One I watched recently, not about nature, I forget the name, but it was about human relationships around the world...how different cultures rate beauty, etc. Its new to Netflix"
605,"I'll definitely look into it and see what I can find, sounds very intriguing."
606,"Yeah. But I also had a chance to do a little gardening, so that was nice. "
606,I am sorry lol I am getting hungry to myself but outside of eating the fact of gardening is just so relaxing for people like us.
606,It really is. It really helps take my mind off of other things and de-stress. 
606,"i eat out a lot , too . my friends are always going out so its hard. i do work out to reduce my stress indeed"
606,I eat out more than I would like. Touring with the band makes fast food a necessity. But I still find time to volunteer. 
606,"What is the name of your band?  I like a lot of fast food, because my work life is so busy."
606,"Metal Gear is our name. It isn't much, but it's a good living. I'm sorry you work so much. That has to be rough. "
606,"i'm touring with my band a lot , but when i'm not i enjoy gardening . i love to work with basket ball game. its so interesting to stress buster"
606,I bet it is. Basketball seems fun. I don't play myself though. 
606,"How about video game basketball, do you ever play NBA 2K16, published by 2K sports? "
606,I do not. I do not play many video games. I mostly spend my free time gardening or volunteering with the humane society. 
606,that is very nice of you . 
607,That's interesting. I've been needing a little faith. I've been so lonely recently.
607,It can certainly help and it is a great way to meet people through groups and the like.
607,Yeah. My mom is an artist and is sort of a recluse. So I'm neither well-socialized nor religious
607,An artist? That sounds really cool. I love creative people. Does she paint or sculpture or what?
608,I really like being a vegetarian. I dont like hurting animals.
608,I am against hurting animals as well. Good for you!
608,I have read alot of books on being a vegetarian. I have bought so many used books.
608,Great for you! How long have you been a vegetarian. Was it difficult to find variety of options
608,I have been one for over 5 years now. Have you ever been one?
608,I have and it didn't go so well for me. I hope your experience is!
608,It just takes time to learn how to drive one. You should try again. 
608,you are right ! i should try
608,"I think you will do really well, if you try. I enjoyed talking to you"
608,i really appreciate that ! same here !
608,Have a great day and go read a book.
608,"OKay, have a good day!"
609,"I have long red hair. I think that they do, I am really not sure. "
609,i love red hair. My cat even has red hair.
609,"Red is one of my favorite colors. I have a red scooter, that I like to ride, that is red. "
609,Oh yeah? What shade of red? My car is candy apple red.
609,That is exactly what my scooter is. 
609,Where do you like to eat out? I love Subway. I'm simple. lol
609,"Yes, that it is. I really like all different kinds of places. "
609,"When I get a tuna Subway, I bring it home and give some to my cat."
609,That is good. Cats like tuna
609,So true! Do you have any pets? 
609,"I have one kitty. She is a pain, but I like her."
609,The most annoying (I guess?) thing about my cat is that he likes to rub his face against my face.
610,"two weeks, i have to prepare and get the house in order for thier arrival"
610,Do you have a lot you need to get done?  I'm getting ready to go out myself in my Honda and run a few errands.
610,"yes, cleaning the house and making sleeping arrangement."
610,Hopefully you get everything done and you have a nice visit.  After my errands my family and I are piling in the Honda and heading to the beach!
610,awesome that sounds like a great idea me and my family can do when they get here. 
610,We love the beach.  Sometimes we hit up a comedy club and I do the open mike night.  My friends tell me I'm pretty funny.
610,"who doesn't love the beach...the smell of the ocean, the clashing of the waves and the nice breeze is always soothing."
610,"We love collecting seashells, but sometimes have a hard time fitting them all in the trunk of the Honda for the ride home with all the luggage."
610,cool i bet you have a extension collection of beautiful shells back at home....i would like to see them sometime
610,Sounds like a plan.  Maybe you can come out to the comedy club and check out some of my jokes.
610,yeah that sounds great..i didnt know you was funny like that. its always good to have a laugh and a drink
610,"I couldn't agree more.  Well, I hope you have a nice visit with your family."
611,"Nice, I paint for a living, although it's not much at the moment."
611,painting is a great way to express yourself too. brings you in touch with what you think beauty is.
611,"Yeah, I think yoga and art both help you get in touch with your inner self."
611,For sure. hiking is great too but having that view in front of you helps alot.
611,I feel bad as my family doesn't know what I do. They think I'm in law school still!
611,Why did you leave law school? was it a hard decision?
611,This is what I want to do but law is what they want me to do. I'm lying to them until I figure out how to tell the truth.
611,You'll find it within you to come to them when you are ready. I applaud you finding your passion.
611,Yeah I hate lying to them but they would be so upset right now. Maybe you can teach me yoga so I can relax more!
611,Haha you got it! It'll certainly help approaching them calmly. Those situations can get hairy!
611,If you want a mural on your studio walls or some nice paintings let me know. I work cheap lol.
611,"Oh I certainly would compensate you justly for your work, I'm not one of those people!"
612,My happiness right now all has to do if weather or not I hear my neighbors yelling in the middle of the night.
612,"i am sorry to hear that, do they argue almost every night?"
612,Almost and I'm in a townhouse so we share a wall and you can hear them through the wall
612,"Ah that is really bad, have you tried talking to them?"
612,My husband has and that started an fight between them
612,If that didnt work the only thing you can really do is call the police
612,"Yeah, its only an issue when we are trying to watch tv. Once we go to our rooms you can't hear them anymore"
612,"im grateful that i dont like in a townhouse, what do they usually argue about?"
612,Everything. They have been quiet the last couple nights I wonder if one of them left.
612,"It would probably be for the best, for everyone involved"
612,"Yes, I hope so make my life a lot quieter. What brings you happiness"
612,"I find joy in the little things in life, what about you?"
613,I wonder if the armor serves any other purposes.
613,survival is key and everyone looks to survive.  
613,That's true! They seem to have an advantage.
614,I'm a junior. What are you studying?
614,liberal arts
614,Cool. I'm studying accounting. What's your favorite class this semester?
614,"none of them, i'm a freshman in LA were not doing any art. what about you?"
614,I'm taking an astronomy class right now. I love watching the night sky.
614,oh !! me too! i am actually working on an oil painting of the planetary alignment right now. do you have a favorite galaxy or planet?
614,I really love Mars. The starkness of the landscape is beautiful to me. Would love to see us set foot on it one day.
614,we will.  it is indeed gorgeous.  have you seen the universe documentary on Netflix? 
614,"I haven't - need to check it out. As an artist, which do you appreciate more - simplicity or complexity?"
614,complexity by far but i can make simple complex ;)
614,Hah! I gravitate toward the extremes of each side. Especially in music.
614,"i love music but i am very particular. it's metal or classical, period. what about you?   "
615,"Yes I do, it is video games. I like to play them and want to become a streamer some day."
615,What kind of video games are you into?
615,I like to play all kinds but I mostly like to play FPS and TBS.
615,I love video games too! I also like teaching as a passion too! Kindergarten to be specific.
615,"Ah, that is very cool. Kindergarten was my favorite grade in school. How long have you been teaching?"
615,It's been about 5 years now. I've learned so much since I first started! Especially with fashion around kids too if that makes sense.
615,What is the most important thing you have learned since you started?
615,I think that learning through play is an important part of childhood development!
615,"That is very interesting, have you considered teaching other grades or are you focused on Kindergarten age only?"
615,Not at the moment. I am able to use so many styles of teaching with them.
615,Understandable. I believe teachers deserve much higher salary due to how important they are to our society and our children.
615,"I agree! Formal teachers are so important to most countries, they deserve so much respect"
616,I do love guitar. I actually offer classical lessons.
616,Cool. So do you play the violin too or do you just enjoy listening?
616,I just enjoy listening. I LOVE classical music.
616,Me too. I would love to take lessons but my schedule's pretty full. Working and doing volunteer work.
616,Well at least that is a good use of your time!
616,"Yes, but it's not easy. We're getting a lot more customers at the candy store since it's so close to the holidays."
616,Oh yeah i bet. Love me some sweets. So does everyone else apparently.
616,LOL. Me too. I also do a lot of grassroots work for local politicians I believe in.
616,That is good. Not enough people are involved or even care about politics. Gotta vote.
616,"Absolutely! Voting is very important. Plus, I'm really interested in politics."
616,Would you ever run for office?
616,I think I might run for office sometime in the future. 
617,"you will be ok, the credit card company will take care of it"
617,I am so worried about it. I wait tables and that is what I put the money on. 
617,you are coverd
617,"That is good to know. I was so upset, that a friend brought me flowers. "
617,aww that was sweet of them
617,"Yes it really was. That brought me a rose, which is my favorite."
617,nice
617,Thank you. Tell me something about you.
617,i have 3 dogs and 1 cat
617,What kind of puppies do you have?
617,rottweilers 
617,They are big and most of the time the most loving dogs. People give them a bad rap.
618,Italian food is great. Have you been to Italy before?
618,"No, but I would love to go. Have you been?"
618,"Yes, this summer i went on vacation to Italy."
618,Wow!  That is awesome.  What are some places you recommend going there?
618,"Number on my list in The Colosseum in Rome, Renaissance art and architecture in Florence"
618,I bet Renaissance Art and Architecture was a beautiful place to visit.  Any other places you have visited?
618,Grand Canal and Piazza San Marco in Venice
618,The Grand Canal?  What did you do there?
618,To explore the water and go on a boat ride.  I sometimes go for yoga classes too
618,I would love to start yoga.  Do you like it?
618,Yoga is great for the body and mind
618,Yes and Zen yoga is also really good for that.
619,Yes. I spend every day at least fixing one thing. I really enjoy it.
619,you will be the change in future. the spirit you have is the key to get the success. keep it go
619,Thank you! What about you? Do you like fixing things to make things better in the world?
619,i agree . another thing we can do to fix the world we live in .  i also think to do the same
619,That is great. Vinyl records are my favorite to another music recording format. I am working to make it were mostly vinyl records are used.
619,really you are awesome man. Call me old fashion but i prefer vinyl records to any other music recording format. 
619,"Yes, with this younger generation sales are starting to boom with a renewed interest in vinyl records."
619,yes you are correct. i love to have cat with me. do you grew pets
619,"I have 3 cats, actually."
619,ok good. cats can see in near darkness. I scared about dark so my pet is useful for me. 
619,"I am also scared of the dark and so my cat is useful to me for that, as well."
619,I so wish I could be a cat... ohhh how easy life would be!
620,I really like glasses. I like that you can pick so many different sytles. 
620,Do you wear glasses or do you have 20/20 vision
620,I have glasses to wear. 
620,Do you wear the ones that correct vision or you wear them for cosmetic reasons?
620,I have to wear them for corrective vision. I would be blind without them. 
620,Nice! I provolone cheese on my sandwiches. how about you?
620,It is one of my favorite. I like that kind.
620,What is your favorite kind of food?
620,My favorite is fried dough. My granny use to make it for me. 
620,yum ! my dad used to make that .
620,It is the best. I used to enjoy helping her. 
620,Do you listen to music?
621,"It can be time consuming. I lead a research department for a large restaurant chain, so my plate it full."
621,"Wow. You are better at adulting than I am! I pretty much smoke pot, eat pizza puffs and hang out with (quote, unquote) friends."
621,Well I had my share of that when I was younger. I actually am in charge of french fries so smoking pot would be nice!
621,Cool! Does your place serve bbq sandwiches? I love those!
621,"No, we do mostly tacos. Del Taco."
621,I haven't had Del Taco in ages. I used to eat their after high school all the time. Like at that age when I needed five square meals a day!
621,LOL understand. I miss being young that's for sure.
621,"Some of my (quote, unquote) friends are young. Some are my age. Some are older."
621,Yeah age will sneak up on you. Enjoy it while you can.
621,I should probably make some real friends before I croak.
621,Yeah it is nice to surround yourself with people that care.
621,My imaginary friends are caring - but my therapist tells me that is ultimately not healthy.
622,Yeah it does 
622,"I live near Disney, go there with my two roomates about twice a year. Ever been?"
622,Really 
622,"Yes, Florida residents get discounts? Have you been to Disney parks?"
622,"No, I haven't been there "
622,You should go sometime. The park has a happy feeling. Where do you like to visit?
622,I will love to visit someday 
622,"Aww, are there any interesting places to visit near where you live?"
622,"Not really, I work too much as a medical assistant "
622,Well it's good to have steady work. Do you have any hobbies?
622,"Yeah, I play football. How about you "
622,Football. COOL! I love college football. My hobby is growing fruit trees. Want some Mango's?!
623,"As far as I know, it's maintained by Facebook and other companies. "
623,Interesting. Where do you like to vacation?
623,Bora Bora!!! what about you?
623,I went to Hawaii once and visited all but one of the Islands. It was like visiting heaven.
624,"I've been wanting to see The Joker, but I'll have to see what else is playing before I decide."
624,I've heard the Joker is pretty decent. I was going to go last weekend but I got held up with something.
624,"Yea, It looks interesting and the reviews seem to be great. Bummer you didn't get to go last weekend. What held you up?"
624,I went hiking with some friends and we had a great view of the sunset so we stuck around.
624,That sounds like so much fun! At least it was something worthwhile and enjoyable. I love sunsets.
624,"Me too, you honestly can get lost in them before you realize it! Do you ever hike?"
624,I don't. I used to when I lived in the country. Now I'm more of a beach bum.
624,Hey the beach can have the same effect too. I have to get out to the beach more often.
624,"Oh for sure. The beach is my happy place, I could stay for hours and never get bored. "
624,Did you ever see that movie The Beach Bum? That guy loved the beach too haha.
624,"I haven't! I'm not sure I've ever heard of it, actually. What genre is it?"
624,It's comedy I guess but there is some dramatic elements to it as well.
624,"Sort of the best of both worlds, then. I'll have to look into it. Thanks!"
625,That is very interesting. I try to live off of the land as much as possible. I learned many agricultural skills from my parents.
625,Farming seems like a very natural activity
625,"I believe so, there is much value in living a subsistence lifestyle. "
625,yep farming and agriculture is a large scale system to keep us alive
625,Are you passionate about agriculture as a whole?
625,"Everyone has to be to some extent, it is vital for our bodies.Food is vital for life "
625,That is very true. What is your favorite food?
625,"I am a red meat lover, but I am trying to eat more vegetables"
625,Red meat is very good. Do you enjoy smoked meat?
625,They are quite nice when cooked. But I definitely wouldn't eat a raw one.
625,Yes raw is not an ideal condition for it.
625,"Raw meat such as steak tartare is a problem, but any cooking kills bacteria."
626,"LOL. I love donuts too, but I have to watch my weight. Swimming helps."
626,Yeah same here. I need to start lifting weights.
626,"I haven't tried weight, but maybe I will. Do you like to swim too?"
626,Swimming is fun! I occasionally go for a swim here and there.
626,I love it. It's relaxing. And being in a pool really feels great when it's hot outside.
626,Very relaxing. I like swimming in the ocean as well! 
626,"Wow. I haven't tried swimming in an ocean before, but I be it's a lot of fun."
626,"Sure is. So many animals out there, too. Lol"
626,And they come in so many beautiful colors.
626,Aren't they beautiful? I also really enjoy just floating on the surface of the salt water. That is very relaxing as well.
626,Have you done any deep sea diving? I would love to see a starfish up close.
626,"I have gone snorkeling! Not entirely diving, though. "
626,Really? Have you ever seen a purple starfish? 
626,"Purple starfish, I have not. But I have seen a reddish orange one before."
626,I love the color purple and I think starfish are awesome. LOL
626,"Haha! Yeah, that would be a cool mix to find. Purple and a starfish. Well it was nice talking to you!"
627,I enjoy those bits... but I'm mostly into the culinary pieces.  I've published a few.  :P
627,that's so cool! What exactly did  you write about? 
627,"Usually, a recipe with some science behind it.  Like... how to temper eggs into a custard... and why they curdle if you don't temper them correctly."
627,"Oh  okay that. makes sense.  Are you a  chef? If so, what's your favorite cuisine? Any recommendation? "
627,"You could say that, lol.  I did train as a chef and love Spanish food. Recommendation?  It depends on you!  What do you like about food?"
627,I'm not picky lol but i don't try new stuff that often. I keep going back for same food every time i go to a restaurant. 
627,What do you usually order at the restaurant?  Maybe I can help with some pointers to recreate that dish at home!
627,nah lol i would rather not try. i'm no chef and  i'm awful at cooking. you have seen friends? remember rachel made beef truffle? yeah that's me
627,Hahah.  I don't remember that episode.  I should though.  I own the box set.  I'm putting it on now.  I think it's on Netflix.
627,Yeah it's on Netflix now. :D  So what kind of restaurant do you work at? 
627,I do meal-prep for personal clients. I tailor meals and nutrition plans for all types of clients.
627,Wow.  i could use that you know! meal prep. You a fitness enthusiast? 
628,Because I thought he would be excited I was bringing in more money.
628,what do you think about him doing online work?
629,It's a 1979 Ford. It was actually given to me by my dad. It's pretty old.
629,That is a very solid truck that you have.
629,"Thanks. It still runs well, but I try to take care of it. Do you have a vehicle you really love?"
629,yes I ride my ford van in the winter when there is much snow. I love the van so much
629,"That must be pretty reliable to drive in the snow. Gotta weigh my truck with sand, but there's not much snow in the South."
629,"It gets the job done and it is great for towing, but like most trucks, the gas mileage isn't great."
629,I can understand that. It's tough to drive when gas prices are higher. 
629, I love to visit the beach. I like taking long walks on the beach.
629,"I just graduated high school in the Spring, and I spent my summer at the coast. It was great."
629,Yeah living around the coast is bliss. Do you watch TV shows. My favorite is Game of Thrones.
629,"I don't watch TV much. I help my dad with his business, and am trying to decide what to do with my life."
629,"whatever you do sounds awesome. Enjoy it, life is too short not to."
630,"They are awesome!  I have this great Red Hot Chilli Peppers T shirt, black, I am always wearing black!"
630,What songs do you like most from Red Hot Chili Peppers?
630,"I love Under the Bridge, it reminds me of home, What about yours?"
630,"that is my favorite band as well , i love their song demon ."
630,"I work as a computer technician, hate it!  If I didn't have my music, I wouldn't make it through the day"
630,sorry . the worst part of my job is the ink stains i get on my shirt .
630,"That is so funny, What do you do for a living?"
630,I'm a medical personnel 
630,"That's a great industry, I have a lot of respect for anyone in the medical field."
631,"I like cosmetics made from natural ingredients. Mind you, the last time I went to the store for some there was a robbery and I was held hostage!"
631,Oh my goodness! Really what happened?
631,"Well, I kind of knew what to do as my Dad is a retired police officer, so I just didn't look at the guy and waited for the police."
631,"Wow, you must have felt so stressed and scared about that robbery.  I can not imagine going through such an experience when just trying to simply buy some makeup."
631,"It really makes you look at people differently, for sure. Makeup's not THAT important, lol!"
631,Very true! I might be scared to return to that store. Are you?
631,"I was for a while, but not now. The robber's in prison, and lightening never strikes the same place twice, right?!"
631,I sure hope that is the case. lol... I have a fear of someone breaking into my home when I am alone.
631,That would be pretty scary - at least with the robbery there were other people around. Do you have an alarm system?
631,"Unfortunately no, we rent our home right now.  I plan to get one when we build a home for sure.  Do you have one?"
631,"No, I live in a town home surrounded by other people, and with triple locks on the doors. This is a really quiet neighborhood though."
631,I live way in the boonies and am surrounded by two other homes.  Hopefully this is an advantage to me since I do not have an alarm system.
632,My mother takes care of our pets and COOKS! Do you cook? Any favorite foods?
632,"I don't cook, honestly I get all of my food delivered so I don't have to deal with the grocery store. Too many people, you know what I mean?"
632,Yes! People are not always nice either? I live in a tourist town. Are there many people near where you live?
632,"I live in a pretty busy town, but I try to avoid any big crowds. My favorite place in the world are the beaches in Florida. Have you been?"
632,Yes! I live right by the Lake Worth Beach. Been here too long though. I miss mountain weather.
632,I'd take a nice warm beach over a cold mountain any day! I wish I could live by a beach.
632,Lots of jobs here but too much HUMIDITY. Do you get to the beach ever?
632,I try to go at least once a year. Are you planning on seeing any mountains soon?
632,Yes. I get to go to Tennessee at Christmas. Can't wait. Hope there's snow. Do you like snow?
632,I like it until I have to go outside and deal with it! We should trade my snow for you sand!
632,"That would be a deal! Sand does get everywhere in the house though and doesn't melt, lol. Hope you have a mild winter where you live"
632,Thanks! I hope your humidity gets dried up real soon!
633,I think it's very ok to be anxious and nervous. It's how we are made and build. But overcoming it is the main thing
633,I agree. Right now I tend to do some kind of neurotic things to control the nerves. Like I am ocd about collecting little figurines. 
633,Well if it helps you to control your nervousness. 
633,"Thank you. Tell me something about yourself, if you;re comfortable with that."
633,"I love to eat vegetables, I drive so much nutrient from them. But I have a gambling problem"
633,I always get the veggie sub when I go to Subway - my fave fast food joint. Sorry about the gambling problem.
633,It's really affecting my life. Because I gamble a lot. I'm already looking for ways to stop it.
633,Do you have any 12 step groups near you? Those help I think.
633,"I've not looked into it. But I will,  thanks for recommending them"
633,Sure thing!
633,It was nice sharing this with you and you helping me with a possible solution
633,bye
634,"It was hard, I need this job.  I am broke!"
634,"Yeah, I hear you. I'm beginning to get into Bitcoin and crypto."
634,"Thats a cool industry, but it is so confusing to me. Bitcoin and Crypto are such odd names."
634,"I'm getting started in it, I feel like I'm probably going to get rich and go broke a few times over haha."
634,HA!  If you do get in maybe you could get rich!
634,"What job are you getting into? I actually teach dance, mostly salsa. I love it but the pay is not good."
634,"Right now I am a janitor at Disney, people laugh, I hate words like trash, so I give it sassy names so its nicer"
634,You're a custodial engineer at a major corporation. I'd put that on the resume.
634,I love that!  I am going to use it.
634,I'll hire you when my bitcoins go through the roof. Or I'll clean your toilets if it tanks lol.
634,I will come work for you but we must call the toilets SnapDragons ( sassy)
634,I hope those dragons don't breathe fire!
635,"I have 2 sisters also, when it rains I actually like it a lot. "
635,How often does it rain? What's the average level of precipitation? 
635,"It rains a lot, I think it is about 45 inches per year. Does it rain a lot near you? "
635,Not really. It is very dry place. That helps to take my dog outside a lot.
635,"Nice, Do you ever put your dog in a van? "
635,never. I dislike dog smell in a car. btw I am looking a new job as a dog walker
635,"Nice, a friend of mine does that. He does pretty well. Stay away from highrises though"
635,What's wrong with highrises?
635,"Dog walkers have to maximize their time, so my friend prefers not to have to go up and down elevators./ "
635,"Makes sense. Yet, there are only highrises here. I have no choice"
635,"Yeah, charge more then. We have a mix here in DC. "
635,I have a better idea. I will ask them to bring their dogs to me first. Do you think that's gonna work?
635,"Yeah, that works. Everyone wants their dogs walked at the same time though too (lunchtime). "
636,what does that have to do with the fact that i am bad at it
636,honestly i'm not sure i'm just floating ideas out there
636,fair enough
636,do you own any property?

637,I enjoy gardening. I live in south florida so not much snow? Ever visit Florida?
637,I have visited Florida many times. I do enjoy the beachs there but do not think I could live there.
637,"You're SMART. Too much humidity here and TOURISTS.  My kids though, raised here, can't take cold so I'm stuck. Do you have any kids?pets?"
637,"I do have a pet, a 5 year old dog but do not have any children yet. Hopefully marriage and children are to come in the next few years."

637,Do you have any suggestions for festivals to attend? I am not so familiar with festivals.
637,Yes. Fall festivals are everywhere this time of year.
637,"I will have to look into some, they sound like a good time. "

637,"People watching is very entertaining, one of my favorite things to do when I am out and about."

639,"I love the black coat Morty wears, especially since the black is my favorite color. Who do you like more"
639,i love the morty wears too
639,How many seasons do you think they will keep doing?
639,maybe three

640,"I like messing around on the internet and learning how to do stuff, but I couldn't build one. That's a great hobby to have!"
640,It's actually not too hard to do. There's good tutorials that can show you ever step. What are your hobbies?

640,I definitely recommend it! What sort of stuff do you read?
640,Mainly legal dramas and biographies. I'm fascinated by other people's life experiences. Do you read much?
640,No but I listen to audio books in the car. I also like biographies.
640,"Audio books are good. With biographies, it's fascinating how famous people grew up and how they got to where they are."
640,"Yes, I like ones about inventors and scientists. "
641,"Yea, a good bit actually. I really like going to concerts. Who are you into currently?"
641,I have never been to a concert. Whose concert did you attend?  I like pop. Don't have any particular favorite singer
641,"I've been to tons, too many to list actually.  311, Sublime, Tool, Justin Timberlake, 21 Pilots just to name a few. "
641,"That's cool. hey, do you like dogs?  "

643,It is really fun! Although they are a bit competitive.
644,turns out they are embarrassed to be seen with me
644,what did you do to embarrass them?
644,I called them out for stealing money from me
644,ah yeah. that'd do it. i used to embarrass my friends because i always wreaked like cigarettes. i am a former smoker.
644,smoking is great
644,i used to like to smoke in my car. now i just do hour long drives for fun. i don't smoke during them though.
644,"I like to smoke while I am eating, and it grosses people out"
644,in my opinion only a coward would be grossed out by that
644,lol nice
644,later today i'm going to go on a 4 hour car ride to nowhere for fun
644,I like doing that
644,car rides are the coolest

645,"I do not have any kids, so when I come home after work, I can relax"
645,"That must be so nice. I do have kids, three to be exact. Being a mom is sometimes a challenge. However, it is very rewarding."
645,"I am divorce.We were married for 8 years, but she did not want to have kids and that is why I divorce her."

646,"I am always hungry, I wish I had the same craving for going to the gym."
646,Me too! How do you get exercise?
647,I'm more afraid of plummeting than actually crashing.
647,Which airline are you flying with?
647,"Southwest I think, I work in the early morning so I like the early, less busy flights."
647,I have bad memories with Southwest. I broke my nose in one of their planes when I was ten.
647,"Be right back, changing carriers lol. I'ma actually a nurse so I guess I have to help if anything happens on the plane!"
647,Hope you don't have to use your skills in the plane. Do you enjoy jazz music? I do a lot
647,"At times, we're looking to start a family soon, you think smooth jazz could work as lullabies?"
647,"No way, Jazz is not for kids. Congrats btw on starting a family soon. Who is going to be your partner?"
647,"My husband, we are traveling cause traveling with an infant seems like an awful idea. Getting it done now!"
647,Fantastic. Where are you traveling>
647,"Touring Europe, neither of us has left the US. Want to explore the world a little before settling into parenthood."
647,"Certain European countries became dangerous to visit, you need to be careful."
648,I can't wait to find out how the game of thrones ends this season. I'm so excited!
648,"I wont spoil anything for you, but I assure you it's epic!"
648,"I'll probably buy the season on DVD from Walmart. I love shopping there, they carry Game of Thrones board games to books."
648,Do you play board games? I play a lot of them with my grandparents.
648,Somewhat when my young siblings ask me to. I may get the Game of Thrones Monopoly game for novelty sake
648,You should play it with them if you do get it. I bet it's a lot of fun
648,Absolutely. What's your favorite place to shop? I know Walmart carries everything so it's a one stop shop for me.
648,I live near a Target so I'll go there sometimes. I kind of shop around based on the best prices.
648,"Yeah, it's really all about convenience to a location. There are less Target locations near me as opposed to Walmart."
648,"Yeah I'm from an area that was more wal-mart friendly, Target is actually a new thing to me haha."
648,"Target stores have a nicer, cleaner and have less cramped isles in my opinion."
648,Yeah but I guess wal-mart will have more stuff which could be helpful.
649,Yes i really like pets
649,Me too! I love them.
649,Which pet do you really like?
650,Do you use coupons?
650,"I don't, but my girlfriend does. I play drums in a band and don't make much money so she tries to save."
650,"Yes, saving money could be a good thing for sure!  I wanna save money and get a ford mustang convertible."
650,"A convertible would be nice, not in the winter though. I have a Ford Mustang 1965"
650,Oh that's is cool!!!  Love the older mustangs.  what kind of engine you have in it?
650,350
650,Oh wow... that's not the stock engine is it?
650,I think so. I got it from my grandpa when he passed away. Don't know too much about them. What kind do you want?
650,65 fastback with an inline 6
650,"Wow, that is a sweet ride!"
650,What color is your 65 mustang?
650,It's been repainted. It's Dodge Viper GTS Blue pearl coat. I love it.
650,Oh wow... that sounds like an amazing ride!!!!!

651,I love to bake as well. My specialty is sour cream pound cake! What do you bake?
651,I like making chocolate cake the best. I've also been experimenting with vegan recipes. They are really good! 
651,Everyone loves the person who bakes. Do you make these at Christmas time or Thanksgiving?
651,I make them at least once a month. I have a really bad sweet tooth. 
651,"Yes, me too. It's harder to bake some things here because of the humidity. Mountain dry air works best for baking"
651,"Yes, it does. Do you like to bake anything else?"
652,Do you like watching them during the day? They might not give you so much anxiety then
652,"Yes, most of the time i am scared of future events"
652,I am sorry to hear that. What scares you about the future? 
652,Just too many things that could happen in the dark.
652,"Yes, a lot of things can happen in the dark. Maybe you should carry around a flashlight."
652,Good idea!
652,I use the flashlight on my phone. Do you like basketball?
652,No I'm more of a football fan!
652,Oh football is okay. But I like basketball better. I want to play overseas!
652,"i aspire to play overseas , but i am not sure maybe i am going to be a better player"
652,You just need to practice more. How tall are you?
652,just average . are you unusually tall ?
653,"Yes I was, I'm settled in now, working part time at aldis. Where do you work?"
653,I work at the bank. Do you like your new place?
653,"Cool. Yeah it's pretty sweet, i like it here. I don't know many people so I watch a lot of movies."
653,I watch a lot of movies too. I live alone so I have to entertain myself.
653,"My favorite movie is Titanic, whats yours?"
653,Titanic is a good one! It's hard to pick a favorite. Maybe The Notebook.
653,"Oh I haven't seen that yet, what's it about?"
653,It's a love story about this old couple. The wife has Alzheimer's and he tells her the story of their life together.
653,"Oh that sounds really interesting, spoiler alert! Just kidding I don't mind. What's your 2nd favorite movie?"
653,No spoilers! Don't worry! Hmm.. Step Brothers.
653,"Oh that's a really funny movie, I know many quotes from it!"
653,It's a great movie! What's your 2nd favorite?
654,"I sure have. I actually run a small bakery - we do quite a lot of wedding cakes, lol"
654,What are your favorite cakes to make?
654,"I like all sorts, but my favorite right now is to make a flourless cake. So many people have gluten issues I like to provide something for them."
654,Are there any cakes you make that have a dab of whiskey?  I love whiskey!
654,"I sure do! Being from Scotland, I definitely have that in my repertoire. A chocolate whiskey cake, actually."
654,"That sounds amazing, I will have to try that.  As a janitor I have downtime to eat snacks."
654,"I should bake you some chocolate whiskey cookies, lol. That would make your day fly by!"
654,"Haha, thanks for the idea!  This is making me hungry right now!"
654,"Me too. All these cakes and pastries are for sale, so I don't eat them...at least, not during the day :)"
654,Nothing wrong with taking home the leftovers!
654,"Too true. Thankfully for my wallet and my waist, there aren't often many leftovers to take home!"
654,"True, maybe you should just save that for holidays for a treat."
655,I like to grow flowers and fruit trees. Do you ever garden?
655,"Yes, I have a variety of flowers, vegetables and fruits."
655,I once had chickens. It was crazy around here. Have you ever seen a live chicken?
655,"No, they don't let you get that close, but I'd love to see what their leathery shell is reallylike."
655,Chickens are much noisier than I ever imagined. They do lay lots of eggs
655,But I am eat chicken. Do you eat chicken?
655,"Yes, I eat chickens, just not the ones I had. Tasty. I also like bacon!"

655,"Yes, one here in Florida and one in California. Ours is bigger."
655,I love California.
656,"Yes, it is my favorite time to bust out some songs!"
656,I do it too! It's weird how it just feels so natural to start singing while in the bathroom.
656,"I know, I just do it automatically. I would never do that with people around."
656,My golden retriever always looks at me funny when I sing
656,Aw that is cute though. How many dogs do you have?
656,"Three. Golden retriever, pitbull, and a whippet. Do you have any dogs?"
656,"No, though I probably should. I'm a shy person, they would be good company for me."
656,I always forget how much I need them till I'm away from them for a while.
656,"Sounds like you love them a lot and they love you, except when you sing lol."
656,"Haha. Yeah, we're a family. It works considering I don't plan to have kids. Do you have kids?"
656,"No kids either. Just me, which is why I get to have the bathroom to myself."
656,"Such a luxury, let me tell ya. "
657,which language? 
657,I would love to learn French!  Do you like music?
657,"yeah i love music. especially music in english, or spanish. i am fluent in both of those languages."
657,I love music!  Have you heard of fine frenzy?  They are my favorite band.
657,I have not. I mainly listen to the music that is played at my local casino. I have a gambling problem
657,"Oh, You should get therapy, I work with animals, it helps when I am struggling.  I love animals"
657,I love animals too! I named my dog Jack because his fur is colored black
657,When you feel like gambling you should consider volunteering at animal shelter.
657,honestly that's not a bad idea
657,You should give it a try
657,noted. i hope to help out animals in need
657,You should come with me one day
658,It was quite terrifying. I wonder if he recognized me from my controversial article published in the new yorker magazine.
658,I had to move apartments because there was a man nearby that harassed me almost every day. What was your article about?
658,That seems even like a worse situation than mine. My article was a criticism on China's humanitarian violations.
658,Oh I think I heard about that article. Maybe I'll read it now.
658,The article is especially relecent to their recent repression of the Uighurs. Do you have any phobias?
658,Can you have a phobia of job-hunting? ha ha I just got a new job and I'm scared of having to do all that again
658,"Lol that is absolutely a real phobia, I know exactly what you mean. Job searching is the worst. "
658,Tell me about it. Being an administrative support specialist isn't my dream but I'll take what I can get
658,"I do not blame you at all, the job market can be difficult to navigate but do not give up on your dream job!"
658,"Hey, thanks! I'm still young so I have time to get where I want to go"
658,"Absolutely, don't procrastinate and keep hustling until you get to where you want to be. Your future self will than you! "
658,I'm trying to keep that in mind but it gets tough some days 
659,yeah well i get that. lol it's tiny enough for me to put it on a truck and take it to another state for a ride. 
659,Yes! lol I love to travel. My band travels sometimes.
659,you have a band?  wow you guys can come over at my tiny house.  We can party like those Bacardi advertisements. lol 
659,Yeah. I play drums. I am a decent enough drummer. We'd totally play your tiny house!
659,you might have to set up your band on the roof though. lol 
659,"Not sure I could get up there. Ugh, I need to workout - but I hate going to the gym. lol"
659,oh no! now that's a problem.  I can play drums in your place. not saying i'm good. lol 
659,Cool - sounds like a plan!
659,Get yourself a pair of ear plugs to be on safe side. 
659,Nah. You will do fine.

660,Ladybug. And you?
660,Spider. I became their fan when I was a kid. Why do you like ladybug?
660,Because they are beautiful and eat pesky mosquitos!
660,Ladybug eating mosquitoes? Never heard. Where did you learn that?
660,In science class in school.
660,Amazing. Who else eats mosquitos?
660,I'm not sure. I just remembered that fact.
660,Mosquitofish is their enemy. I learnt that when I was thinking to join the military.
660,Are you in the military? I'm studying to be a music teacher myself.
660,Not really. Changed my mind and became a car mechanic. Do you enjoy the sound of the car engine? It is like a music to me ;)
661,"I'm so bust though, it's tough to take care of my cats"
661,"Yes, cats can be difficult to take care of most of the time"
661,yea and they leave me no time to watch Dragon Ball Z
661,watching it with your cats ? do they like goku or what did you think about that?
661,"lol I'm alone who else would I watch it with, the cats like Krillin"
661,"I see. lol. I hate cats, sorry"
661,"it's ok, alot of people don't like them"
661,fair enough I think it's cool how cats can see at night so they can hunt

661,I though you don't like cats?\
661,yes i think my fiance is a fan
662,Do you have a motorcycle?
662,"I do not, I drive a truck.  What about you?"
662,"No, I have a van. It's awesome. I can bring home lots of plants with it 'cause it has a sunroof."
663,"Yeah, it's absolutely confusing to know what insurance covers these days. "
663,I'm still in school so my parents handle all that.
663,You must be hitting those book pretty heavily this semester. I try to read as much as possible on my downtime.
663,I just got promoted to a brown belt in karate. I think I'm hitting more wood blocks than books. 
663,"I used to be a brown belt but I was living on my own and had bills to pay, so I had to give it up and bartend instead."
663,I guess you could bounce at the bar too! I hope I don't get kicked and have to deal with all that insurance stuff.
663,I'm more slim like Bruce Lee and they usually hire large framed guys as bouncers. I guess they visually make more of an impact.
663,I bet he Bruce Lee could take out most of the big guys. I sing at my school so I need to avoid getting hit in the mouth lol.
663,"Actually, bouncers are given insurance to cover any such sustained injuries. I'm sure it depends on the club hiring though."
663,My choir has a performance coming up...hard to sing well with a mouth full of gauze.
663,"Yeah, for sure. I wish you the best on your next performance."
663,"Thanks, maybe me and the chorus will hit you guys up for the afterparty."
664,"I love tacos. I live in Houston, Texas so great tacos are everywhere. What's your favorite taco?"
664,"I am a fan of the cheesy gordita chruch from taco bell, the chain of fast food restaurants that started in irvine."
664,"Ha, thats a classic. Even with lots of authentic options I still get down with Taco bell. Big fan of the crunchwrap supreme."
664,Those are really good. I am more of a burrito man myself.
664,That's fair. Do you like Chipotle?
664,no i did not really it
664,I used to eat there all the time then they had that food quality issue and it seemed like everyone abandoned them
664,Oh sorry about that
664,It's okay. I've moved on to better choices anyway. Do you like motorcycles?
664,i'm always afraid to ride them .
664,"Yeah, I get that. Luckily I've never crashed mine but I know people who have. I always wear a helmet."
664,Ok maybe i am going to try it one day
665,It would be cool if amazon starts delivering by drone
665,That's why I prefer doing my own shopping. I try to go to the farmers market on the weekends.
665,"Yes, the farmers market has the best eggs. Do you cook?"
665,"Most of the time. I can't get everything there, but at least no one loses what I buy. LOL."
665,It's fun to people watch at the markets. Have you been to any festivals?
665,I try to go the fair each year. It's pretty popular here in Nashville. What about you?
665,I live in S. Florida so I go to our local street painting festivals. So many touristy things here.
665,"I haven't been to Orlando yet, but I bet you have amazing tourist sites."
665,"Yes, Disney is fun. I like the local fall festivals. Bet you have some nice ones there."
665,"We do. The music is awesome, especially our country music."
665,Plus you have that lovely cool weather this time of year. You live in a great place. Are there mountains there?
665,Nashville is pretty hilly - lots of hills and mountains. That's why we're called hillbillies. LOL 
666,How do you know that?
666,"You know, I'm not really sure, maybe because they perform so many different roles for people?"
666,I had a one video game where the main character was a ballet dancer. That was funny. Do you enjoy the video games?
666,"Yes, I mainly like action video games that have physical challenges, including hand–eye coordination and reaction-time."
666,You are like me. How much time do you spend on video games?
666,I play a few hours a day with my brother
666,That's a lot. What else do you do for fun?
666,"Mainly Youtube, I do some freelance work on it occasionally, and Reddit. Lots of Reddit."
666,"Ok, back to the subject we started with. What is the best color for my t-shirt? remeber, I have blonde hair"
666,I though we were talking about ballet?
666,"Yes, but I need to get dressed properly first. Nobody likes unwell dressed people during the ballet concert"
666,that makes sense i guess .
667,I know! I have a terrible memory.
667,We just got back from a trip. Nice trip - but I caught a cold. I'm taking vitamin C for it now. That always works best for me.
667,That's not good. At least it waited til after your vacation!
667,Legit! I think I shouldn't have eaten any bread. Something in it makes me ugh ... I usually don't eat it.
667,Strange. Maybe you've got some sort of intolerance.
667,Do you have anything that you can't eat?
667,No thankfully. My daughter can't have any dairy.
667,Does it upset her stomach?
667,Yeah she has colitis. Dairy makes her have flare ups.
667,I'm sorry. And I am grateful that there are more substitutes now than there used to be.
667,Almond milk is our friend.
667,I like almond milk in general. I've been checking out more vegan foods.
668,I fell down a hill one day chasing my dog in the park.
668,"How bad was it, did you break it?"
668,In three places. It was awful!
668,"Oh, that is bad, did you have to have surgery?"
668,Yes. And am now recovering with physical therapy.
668,"how long will you have to do physical therapy for, do they know?"
668,"A few more months. Luckily I'm a professional gamer so can still ""work"" at home."
668,"that is lucky, i dont know how i would perform with a broken leg "
668,It is hard. I miss my walks in the park.
668,do you have anyone to walk your dog for you?
668,Yeah my friend has a dog walking service and comes by a few times each day.
668,i hope they dont charge you for walking your dog haha
669,"Yes, the sugar content IS high. Do you have a favorite soda?"
669,Yes. I have a favorite soda.
669,What kind do you like?
669,for a beverage i prefer dr pepper
669,I like Coca Cola. Do you have a favorite food?
669,I have a favorite food is boiled egg with pepper.
669,"Good and nutritious. I love to stay home and cook and clean. Not sure I needed a college degree, lol. Did you go to school?"
669,I did. I wanted to be old school and learn from the masters.
669,That sounds so interesting. What classes did you like best?
669,I am always like mathematics class and you?
670,What are your dog's names?
670,jessie
670,"Nice, I have a cat and a dog."
670,Im jealous lol
670,yea! I like singing. I sing in the shower really loudly. how about you
670,I also try to sing in the shower sometimes :D
670,that's great. 
670,Do you listen to katy perry in the shower too?
670,of course I do. I also like Britney Spears and lady gaga. how about you?
670,Yes I like Katie Perry and especially the song California Gurls and firework
670,Those are good songs. I like dark horse have you ever heard that one
670,Yes. That song was great
670,Good luck have fun singing in the shower!
671,"Yes I did,  Of course he had already eaten my other favorite food, lobster!"
671,"There are a lot of people allergic to shellfish. That's a bummer though, lobster is good."
671,"When I started at google as an intern, they surprised us with dinner, the best lobster too!"
671,Are there any other types of seafood you like?
671,"Yes, I love shrimp, and Salmon"
671,Yum! I know its kinda mean but I want to learn self defense in case my husband starts eating my food. Lol. 
671,"Haha!  Yes, you could sue him for damages!"
671,Hahaha! You're right! Do you have siblings?
671,"Yes a brother and 2 sisters, how about you?"
671,Wow. You have a big family. I just have a sister. I feel like shes my best friend though. Are you close with your siblings?
671,"Awe, thats great, I am close to my sisters, my brother and I arent too close"
671,I understand. At least your close with your sisters. Thats important
672,"I don't have a lot of money, I just live in a small apartment."
672,I live in a 1BR apartment. Do you ever plan to buy a house?
672,I want to eventually. I want to be able to host my family for holiday parties.
672,"Yeah, I don't really host anyone in my apartment. I hope to eventually get a place with a nice big yard and patio."
672,A yard and patio would be nice. It would be perfect for a summer barbecue.
672,Indeed. It would be much easier to have people over with that extra space. I live in the south. Where do you live?
672,"I live in the mid-Atlantic, somewhat near the Chesapeake."
672,Gotcha. My best friend went to William and Mary law school. I'm guessing you're familiar?
672,I am not familiar with that college. I went to Towson.
672,Right on. My dad was adopted in NC and I just recently came into contact with a bunch of his blood relatives
672,"I also have a large family. I have two sisters, a brother, two of them are married with kids, and we also have a lot of cousins."
672,My mom's side is also large. She was one of five sisters so I have like 12 cousins that I'm pretty close to. It's nice.
673,"yeah, he was a family member for a very long time!  I used to knit him sweaters."
673,"Aw, that's sweet. What kind of dog was he?"
673,"He was a mutt, but we think he had some greyhound in him."
673,Mutts are the best kind! They have such great personalities.
673,"Yes they do, and they also a good majority of the time, do not have the health issues purebreds have."
673,"Oh, that's so true. I can't afford to spend thousands on a pet, and I definitely want to provide them the care they need."
673,"Yeah, it is crazy how much pets cost.  I have another dog and he had jaw sugery"
673,"Oh my goodness, I bet that set you back quite a bit!"
673,Oh you do not even want to know... LOL  Definitely cut into my shopping budget!
673,"I can imagine. My daughter keeps asking for a dog but I just don't know if we're ready yet, financially or time-wise"
673,"yeah, it's a HUGE commitment!  Maybe you can take up knitting like me... it's cheep and distracts you rather well."
673,"Haha, doubt that would work for my three year old! "
673,Hey you never know... teach them young :)
674,"Interesting, but honestly, its not easy."
674,"That is true, you really need protein to stay healthy."
674,"yes, for sure.  I definately need to research to stay healthy."
674,"Whatever you decide, you need to be sure that it's a well balanced diet so you get all the nutrients you need."
674,Great advice!  I am cautiously optimistic!! 
674,"I have a similar problem with maintaining eye contact with people, I am working on getting better, it's a slow road!"
674,"Well, slow is ok, you are trying and that is what matters!"
674,I appreciate that my friend!
674,":) i think its important to relax to who you are.  If you are trying, making progress, its all good stuff."
674,"Well one thing I like to do is belt out songs in the shower to relax, I sound awful but it is only me!"
674,I LOVE to sing in the shower.  It doesn't sound awful...love that for some zen out time!
674,"Yes I do it a lot, it really helps get out stress for sure!"
675,I like to sleep alot too
675,"Me too!  I sleep too much, I am looking for another job"
675,What kind of job are you looking for?
675,I am looking to become a accountant. 
675,Nice. Prehaps you can look at my books sometime
675,I would love too!  Maybe next week?  I am headed to a Pink Floyd concert this weekend
675,Sure! I've never heard of Pink Floyd. What kind of music do they play?
675,"What?  You have never heard of Pink Floyd?  They play Rock music, My favorite"
675,Are they an Amercian rockband?
675,Yes!  What kind of music do you like?
675,I pop and hip-hop music
675,"I like that too, it just depends on my mood."
676,what is your favorite subject in school? 
676,History. 100% my favorite. What about you?
677,No. There was a trump rally and a democrat town hall on as well. Busy night for tv
677,That's interesting! Did you vote for Trump in the election?
677,"Yes. I wanted a ""big rooster"" so to speak, representing the USA on the world stage."
677,"Ah, gotcha. I am also a strong republican and I agree with you. Trump has had his days."
677,I like how he makes me feel safe because I feel he is a workaholic and can address any problem night or day. Big culture war going on though.
677,YOU: I understand that . He is a strong man in his presidency. I dont think he was any different than when he was on television.
677,"He certainly isn't being blackmailed or playing politics.  Wonder who will run in 5 years, when he finishes his term."
677,He has said he will run again next term. Do you think he has a chance of getting re-elected?
677,"Oh yes, he'll win and then after that 4 years, I wonder who will run. It will be hard to go back to insider politicians again."
677,Yes I'd agree with you. I still think it's hilarious that he's president...didn't 
677,"Yes, he's the Master ""Troller"" in chief! Everyone should laugh more. It's not like he'll be in forever like Putin and Xi. He's funny."
677,"Yeah, to be honest I am looking forward to 2021 when his term is set to end."
678,Not most of the time
678,I don't either. I work in pubic relations and it seems most people like to know what is going to happen in life.
678,that is good and great 
678,I guess we're lucky to have this opportunity to talk and get to know each other.
678,yes
678,I work in Seattle. Have you ever been there?
678,i am good
678,"It's a great place for my job, especially with Starbucks there."
678,Really it is good though
678,What do you do for a living?
678,Im working in a hotel has a manager
678,do you meet interesting people at work ?
679,"Yea, It's ridiculous. I don't think it will be getting better anytime soon. I'm going to keep trucking on though! What do you do for work?"
679,I am a teacher. Both of my parents were teachers too!
679,"Aww, thats so great! What a rewarding job. Teachers do not get enough respect, and are definitely underpaid in my opinion. What grade? "
679,grade school actually . i cannot imagine teaching high school students yet
679,"Teenagers require a different skill set entirely, I think. They can be a lot to handle. Not that grade schoolers aren't difficult at times. Its just different."
679,definitely and they need to have their parents around to support them
679,"I completely agree. Grade schoolers are so sweet, and innocent - AND HONEST. I went to visit my son one day and got so many comments about being bald. "
679,"haha, oh to be young where what you say is cute and doesn't have consequences."
679,Yep! Just absolutely no filter. It was all innocent though. 
679,I agree. Do you own any pets?
679,I do. I have a dog and a cat. 
679,Oh I love cats! I had two growing up.
680,What do you do for work?
680,"I am a school teacher. Unfortunately, I have become really jaded. I need to change that."
680,Yeah I can totally understand. What grade do you teach?
680,High school chemistry.
680,Ooh that sounds rough
680,It used to be fine. What do you do?
680,I'm a teacher as well!
680,What grade do you teach?
680,Elementary PE. I played basketball in college so it led me here
680,Do you enjoy that?
680,Yes it's a lot of fun actually
680,Okay - you sound healthy - but what is your favorite dessert?
681,"I am a big fan of robotics, I wonder how long before robots become delivery drivers."
681,I think robots are fascinating!
681,"Me too, though I think the time when they can fool you into thinking they are human is a long way off."
682,"I eat take out all the time, I try to tip well!"
682,That's awesome! Did you still give her a nice tip though? Lol!
682,It is scary how much they can seem like a human!  
682,"yes tips can be a minor or major part of their earnings. Unfortunately, people don't always tip well!"
683,Not really. I need to be extreme in my emotions to really feel like I am alive and it helps.
683,"okay, that's really cool. i write short stories when i have time. do you write as well?"
683,I sometimes write as part of my art with words on the canvas and such. 
683,"That's a very creative process, both artistically and through the written word, too."
683,I enjoy it. What types of short stories do you write?
683,"I write mostly romance fiction. It's not for everyone, but I find it's great for a niche audience. Do you go to school for your art?"
683,Nice. And no I am self taught.
683,"Wow, that takes dedication. Have you sold any of your art? "
683,Yes I have an online store and a gallery sells my work.
683,"That's so cool, I went to the Hyde Park Art Center the other day in Chicago, I hope one day I can sell my art there."
683,Oh wow! That sounds like an amazing time.
683,May I ask what you do for a living?
684,i was supposed to go to thailand but now i am stuck here at home
684,"Jamaica. I'd planned on relaxing by the water and doing some beadwork, but things have changed."
684,"oops, that was a typo. i had thailand on my mind at the time of writing it. i meant jamaica."
684,"I see. Well, I won't be going anywhere for a while. But at least I can enjoy a good book. LOL"
684,excellent! tonight i am going to the opera. going to the opera is one of my hobbies.
684,"I've never gone to an opera, but I love books. Some people consider Les Miserables to be a popular opera."
684,hopefully i don't bonk my head while exiting my car this time. six feet tall is seemingly too tall for my car.
684,That wouldn't be fun. LOL. You're pretty tall. 
684,yeah sometimes it makes life difficult. my back is always very stiff
684,I deal with a stiff back from time to time myself. 
684,yoga would probably be in our best interests
684,"I'm a yoga newbie, but it's become a bit of a hobby for me lately - that and beadwork. "
685,I love cleaning. I find it very therapeutic. How about you?
685,"oh goodness no, I hate it hehe...."
685,"besides driving, I do most of my thinking when I am cleaning!"
685,I get that.   I feel that way when I play the piano or dance
685,awesome! What kind of dance?
685,I am a ballet dancer
685,I am so jealous. I took ballet classes for a few years but I quit. I miss it. Ballet is beautiful
685,"Its tough work, but I love it.  You can always begin again!!"
685,I used to take clogging lessons too. that was a trip lol
685,oh very cool!  I would imagine that would be a challenge for sure!
685,how long have you been ballet dancer?
686,I am vegan. I do not eat animal products at all.
686,well technically you cannot be a vegan if you eat eggs . you can be a vegetarian
686,Yes. It is true. So what about you?
686,i do not eat any animals or animal products
686,Alright. It is true I am vegetarian. I was testing your knowledge. 
686,why would you do such a thing?
686,Sometimes it is interesting to find out how person will behave when presented with a given situation. So are you vegan?
686,No I am not.
686,So what you would call your diet?
686,It's something a family told me about. Small portions of healthy food and exercise.
686,Yes. Your family did right by you. Excellent choices.
686,You as well! Thank you!
686,Have a nice day as well. Thank you.
687,that is true
687,"Ye, BTW I did join a new team last months, how about you?"
687,i have not join any
687,Do you have any favorite cleats?
687,"no, how about you?"
687,My favorite are nike! They're so good. Any hobbies?
687,yea
687,What kind of?
687,puma
687,Sounds nice :) Hope they're good for ya.
687,"it is cool, just for me"
687,"Great, hope you're having a great day there!"
688,good
688,"Usually Thomas Blake is credited for the construction of modern paddleboards, which would have been about the 1930's."
688,I think you are right about that..
688,Do you enjoy paddleboarding?
688,Yes i do
688,"Cool, I could use a partner."
688,Yes i think
688,Would you be interested in joining me sometime?
688,Yes of course
688,"nice! You are on, name the place and time ."
688,When are you going to be free?
688,"Saturday, about noon."
689,That's terrible!  I'm so sorry to hear that.  How has your recovery been?
689,It has been a struggle. I am a farmer so it has really changed my life.
689,"I bet that's hard as a farmer.  I'm just going to college to become a lawyer, so it wouldn't be as big a deal for me."
689,"Ah, that's cool. I heard law school is super competitive."
689,"It's pretty hard, for sure.  I try to keep cool with music, though.  I listen to blues and jazz to relax."
689,"That is very relaxing, my oldest brother plays Jazz profesisonaly "
689,"Oh wow, that's really cool!  Do you like jazz as well?"
689,"Meh, it isn't really my thing. "
689,What type of music do you like?
689,My prefer is Rock but I can listen any kind even  pop
689,Do you listen to it while you're farming?
689,I do. My tractor has a wonderful ACed cab so I can listen to music the whole time
690,Yeah tigers are a bit much for household pets. 
690,"I guess they are. If I could be a cat, I would want to be a tiger."
690,Tiger or a puma for sure.  I like cats. I have a talent for getting them to like me too. 
690,Treat them well and they will.
690,That's my way of thinking too. 
690,"My mom and dad both had red hair, and so do I. I guess that's why I want to be a tiger. Fiery personality."
690,I'm a ginger too.  I've always liked animals.  I took animal husbandry classes in 4H growing up. 
690,I grew up in the country and we had 4H too. What was your favorite animal to care for?
690,Lambs. They're so cute. Foxes are a lot more adorable than I thought they would be as well. Not really related but I saw one in my neighborhood recently. 
690,"We get some foxes around here, mostly red ones. Not as much since new houses are going in."
690,We're topped out on new houses around here. No more room for them. The foxes have a den in the drainage culvert area for the neighborhood. 
690,"That would be a neat use of the object. Hope the kids know to leave them alone, if there are young ones. Both kids and foxes."
691,I like to watch badminton videos to learn more techniques since I just recently started playing.
691,excellent. it's super entertaining to watch. almost as fun to watch as it is to play
691,"It is. I have to change my diet to increase my stamina though, and I'm not a fan of fruits and veggies. "
691,do you go to school by chance?
691,No. I graduated high school a few years ago. What about you?
691,I also just finished school. I just graduated from highschool recently
691,Really? Cool. I bet your diet is better than mine. LOL
691,haha! not in the summer! i eat whatever seems fun in summer. summer is by far my favorite season
691,Do you workout? I really need to start working out so I can get better at badminton.
691,i power walk 4 miles on max incline on a treadmill every day. it's not particularly intense but i break a sweat which is important
691,That's a lot. Maybe if I start small I can work up to four miles
691,just aim for 30 minutes at a pace that makes you sweat
692,"It was a cruise, but we stopped at multiple ports. St Lucia was my favorite. Have you ever been?"
692,"I haven't been there yet, but I'd love to go skydiving there! What did you do?"
692,We went to Sulfur springs. It is a drive in volcano!! it was really awesome! Also beautiful beach and sunset.
692,That sounds incredible! I'll get out there someday. Were you celebrating a special occasion?
692,It was our 20th anniversary and she really made it special.
692,Congratulations! That's a great accomplishment. I know my fiance and I will get that far too.
692,Thank you. It has been a wonderful 20 years. We were High school sweethearts.
692,Awwww that's so sweet. Its very lucky to find your person at such a young age. I feel bad for those who are trying to find the right one.
692,"Yes,  I would not want to be trying to date in 2019. "
692,That's exactly how I feel. 
692,"I can not imagine how you would even meet people! all the dating websites, I would be lost!!"
692,Right?! And who even knows if people have good intentions. Its a strange time in history.
692,"Right,you never know who is actually on the other side of the keyboard!!"
693,I really like movies with cars in them. I drive a Mustang I restored myself.  Cars are my thing.
693,You sound like a lover of cars. Any other favorites besides the Mustang?
693,Anything that goes fast!  I think I got my love of cars from my dad.  Do you like cars?
693,"no not particularly, i dont find cars very fascinating "
693,Understandable.  What do you do for a living?
693,"i work in retail. super boring, but it pays the bills"
693,I know what you mean. My dad's a doctor but I disappointed him by becoming something less.
693,thats terrible! he should be proud of you no matter what
693,That's what I say!  But apparently he doesn't think highly of dentists.
693,"that is nonsense, what is it like to look inside peoples mouths all day/"
693,"I like it but I know people are glad when they leave, not when they arrive."
693,i can understand that . i'm that way with movies .
694,my mom doesn't cook. my dad used to do all the cooking but he passed away a few years ago.
694,"Awe, My mom lives with me, my dad passed away too!  That is hard."
694,Thankfully I have hobbies that keep me busy. Have you heard of larping?
694,No I haven't what is that?
694,You have probably seen these groups in parks or represented in movies.It's a game where a group of people dress up as characters and act out specific roles an scenarios.
694,"Oh that sounds fun!  I have a boyfriend in Italy, so i am learning how to make pasta!"
694,Oh wow! What has been your favorite so far?
694,"I love fettucini the most, I can make shells too though"
694,I love pasta. That sounds like a fun thing to learn how to make. I bet your boyfriend is happy that you're learning!
694,"I enjoy it!  I haven't told him yet, it is a surprise!"
694,What a neat surprise!
694,I can't wait to show him!
695,"No I didn't have pizza, but I usually get what I want anyway."
695,"I had pizza, it was really tasty."
695,Oh that sounds fun. Maybe I will have it tomorrow after school.
695,I may do the same after work. What is your favorite?
695,Pepperoni with extra cheese. I am an only child so my mom lets me get it all the time
695,"Pepperoni is pretty good, but I like pineapple."
695,"Ew, I definitely do not like that at all."
695,"Most people dont, it means I can order a pizza without anyone wanting any."
695,Well that is good you can have it all to yourself
695,It is my lifeblood.
696,It went well. This weekend we're going to a fall festival. Do you have any festivals where you live?

696,"I like the cold too but my daughter likes the heat here. She taught me how to program some, but I don't like it so I mostly substitute teach."
696,You have the ocean near.  That is so fascinating to me.  
696,You know it can be scary. I used to walk it at sunrise and the sound is deafening when it echo's off the condo's.
696,I never would have thought of that!  Do you spend time at the beach much?
696,I am fair skinned so can only go early morning or late evening. I watch it on my computer there is a web cam
696,"I am fair skinned also, i have to be very careful in the sun.  Thank goodness for sunscreen and hats hehe"
697,no I just left the area
697,"Probably a smart move, those guys are gross"
697,He was just so obvious about it made my girlfriend nervous too
697,I get that. I bet anyone would be nervous with someone staring like that
697,Yeah it was weird have you had that experience
697,"Yeah, it's happened before. I just try to get away"
697,That is the best move. We ended up leaving and going to a movie
697,Nice! What movie?
697,"The Joker it was really good, you should see it"
697,I've been wanting to. I've heard it's great 
697,Yeah you won't regret going don't think it would be the same watching at home
697,"Good catch, that was the plan, to watch it at home. I may have to splurge on the theater then"
698,"Soda is fattening, lol. I have 3 dogs I walk to burn calories on them and me! Do you have any pets?"
698,Diet soda only! I do have a dog.  I have a chihuahua named Mia.  I also have a cat. 
698,"Mine are Chihuahua's also. They're my little doorbells, I call them. Is your cat indoor or outdoor?"
698,"Indoor, but my cat has escaped a few times. She always ends up at my front door waiting to come back inside!"
698,Cats are smart! We have lizards here and my cats loves to chase them when she escapes.
698,my cats like lizards too. I find a few dead ones around the house sometimes. where do you live?
698,"I live in South Florida. Moved here after college and now can't get out, lol. My daughter hates cold and so won't move north. Where are you?"
698,"Very cool. I live in Central Florida, born and raised! and I can't wait for our cold-is weather"

699,that's rad i envy your courage to do stand up. i work at amazon myself.
699,"I've been a fan of legendary comedians for years, so I thought I would try it myself. "
699,sometimes i find comedians offensive. i am pretty conservative when it comes to politics
699,I try to keep my comedy neutral so I don't really offend people. 
699,maybe if everything works out as planned you can get a netflix special
699,LOL. That would be awesome. What are some of your hobbies?
699,i really like to gamble! mainly on fights
699,"I'm too scared to gamble. I'm afraid I'll lose too much money, but I'm not afraid of deep sea diving."
699,which ocean do you like to go diving in the most?
699,"The Pacific ocean. I live on the west coast, so I have easy access. Have you tried it?"
699,no way! the ocean terrifies me
700,yes
700,"Same, what did you get?"
700,there was a technical issue
700,Must be a glitch. Do you like parties?
700,yes very much
700,"I like tailgate parties during duck hunting season, my fave!"
700,my favourite too
700,What's your fave part of tailgate parties?

702,Do you watch much football?
702,"yes , love football, my favorite thing to do is make snacks like pickled eggs. Do you like those?"
702,I love Alabama. I like pretty much anything someone will make for me.

702,I don't really play any sports. My girlfriend plays volleyball though
702,"Oh thats cool, maybe you can introduce me to her sometime, i'd like to get to know her."
702,That would be kind of creepy
702,"I don't think so at all, we both play volleyball, we could be great friends."
702,I'm not sure about that. Do you like the Alabama football team? Roll tide!
702,"Yeah they are awesome, a lot of their players go on to the NFL. Who is your favorite?"
702,JJ Watt
702,"Oh yeah he is a beast, one of the best players of all time. I'd love to eat some pickled eggs and watch him play."
703,"Yes, I've become confident in myself over the past two years after losing my confidence."
703,I wish you can achieve success in your projects.
703,Thanks very much. I think it'll go well.  My divorce is in my rearview mirror and I'm looking forward to good things.
703,WOW... that's great to hear!  Always find the positive!
703,"Yes, it broke me up for a while but I'm feeling better now, two years later.  I also have my cats!"
703,woo hoo ! good for you ! i hope you both share a continuously growing happiness .
703,Thanks.  What's going on in your life?  What do you do for a living?
703,I'm a realtor. I haven't quite reached the point where I can stop employment completely. I wish! lol
703,"Yes, that would be great!  Any family?  Kids?  As I said, I've got my cats and that's it now."
703,"I have a dog but I don't have kids yet, I'm not ready for the full responsibility lol."
703,I understand.  That's one of the reasons I don't have kids.  What type of dog do you have?
703,German shepard. they secure my building well
704,He was happy. I love to bake. Do you cook?
704,"I can bake a few things, such as cookies and pies. I want to learn hos to bake a cake."
704,My daughter bakes too and only likes organic ingredients so we have lots of those in the house. Cakes are easy
705,Thats a great album!  
705,It was really a nice album. I saved it to my Itunes on my phone.
705,"Where do you live?  I am in the valley, love wide, open spaces. "
705,I live on the coast. I love the roses here. They're beautiful.
705,That sounds beautiful.  We own a home with 5 acres.  
705,That's a lot of acres. It must be a nice home.
705,We like it!  Plenty of room in case we decide to get animals!
705,What type of pets are you looking for?
705,"I love dogs, I am actually thinking of starting a labrador rescue.  Do you have any pets?"
705,"I have a Husky, and he is my little buddy. My students adore him when I took him to class."
705,Huskys are beautiful dogs!  I am sure the kids love him.  Does he shed alot?
705,"Yes, he sheds a lot since he is a long coated breed."
706,Better than being on my face though. 
706,That would ruin my day! I hope you have recovered
706,It was a little frightening. I took the dogs for a walk at the park and I'm good now. 
706,"Well, I'm glad that things seem under control. I'm having a little issue myself I take things too literally"
706,Why is that an issue? Do you get confused?
706,"Yes, when people text me jokes I take them too literally and it hurts my feelings"
706,That's rough.  Words mean things you know? I take things too literally sometimes too. 
706," Yeah and talking to my parents is tough too. I haven't been able to tell them i'm gay yet, and i'm 37"
706,Maybe you can avoid it entirely. You've gotten this far. Theatre has helped me with the taking things too literally. I go and watch plays. 
706,"You're right I should avoid telling them, thanks for the great advice."
706,If it makes you uncomfortable then maybe it's the way to go. It doesn't sound like you think they'll be very understanding. 
706,Well i'm just afraid of their criticism and that I might take it too literally.
707,yes
707,What happend?
707,they gave it poison
707,Ohh.. no is your dog ok? How do you feel?
707,it really hurts me
707,"Oh, its very hard to hear. Do you have a favorite band? Mine is the muse!"

707,Cool. Health food rules!!! :) Any plans for next days?
707,no eating slept food
707,Can you drink any dairy? Or is that totally off limits
708,are they a famous band?
708,They were somewhat popular in the indie scene but not huge.
708,Where is the band Bon Iver from?
708,Bon Iver is actually an American indie folk band.
708,"oh ok, i never knew they were from America. do you like kids?"
708,"Yes, I love kids :)  You?"
708,yes I do too. I have 2 children of my own.
708,I have two children also :)
708,Does the band Bon Iver also have alot of fans that support them?
708,"yes, they have quite a big following.  Smaller than huge pop artists, but I like it that way.  "
708,"Yes, they get some fame, but not alot."
708,"yes, they kind of feel like mine, if that makes sense."
709,he is very rich
709,Yup! He is also a businessman and an investor!
709,he must be lucky
709,Yes! Also he was married 4 times in his life!
709,why four times?
709,because i married 3x to the wrong people
709,sorry for that
709,When he cheated on me i kept listening to 
709,trust is the baseline for everything
709,Darn right it is
709,yes sure
709,yep
710,I had no choice - I had a presentation to give that morning. Covered in coffee!!
710,oh man ! that's awful ! sounds messy .
710,"It was, lol. I can laugh about it now, but it wasn't so funny at the time. I should have had my camera to film myself!"
710,I've done that before on my way to a ballet class. Not a good look! I didn't have a change of clothes with me. 
710,"Me either. Thankfully, everyone was very understanding, if amused. I wanted to just die, but don't like thinking about that subject, lol"
710,I don't blame you! We can change the subject! What's your favorite hobby?
710,"I love golf, and also filming. I carry a camera everywhere with me. You?"
710,i'm into photography . i love taking pictures of everything! But ballet is my number one.
710,"Oh, ballet. My cousin was a ballet dancer. She's too old now, but she was amazing to watch. Do you dance?"
710,I do! It's so much fun to dance and do aerobics to the energetic music! You hardly realize you're exercising!
710,"Oh, you're so lucky - I have two left feet! I'll stick with filming beautiful things and golfing, lo."
710,It's not easy but I love it!
711,Can I listen to music on a paddleboard?
711,"Well, you could, but I don't think it would help you. What kind of music do you like?"
711,"Anything with a beat I can dance to.  I eat a lot of food, so I like to exercise."
711,Do you like the piano? I've been learning how to play it recently. 
711,"I do.  I took some lessons growing up, we had a piano in my childhood home. "
711,"That's great, I'm not that great at it yet, but I've been making progress. Are there any other instruments you play?"
711,"Yes, I sing and play guitar"
711,"Cool, are you in a band?"
711,"I used to be, but I'm getting a bit old for all that tock and roll haha"
711,"I can empathize, just learning how to play the piano doesn't leave much time to actually just play it."
711,I'd like to get a piano again.  They can be nice furniture pieces as well as instrumnets
711,"Absolutely, too bad they're so expensive. But I think owning one is totally worth the cost."
712,That's so exciting! Congratulations :)
712,congrats to you too ! do you work ?
712,"Yes, I work at a non-profit that helps children. Do you work?"
712,I do IT but only part time
712,"Oh, that sounds interesting! Do you enjoy it?"
712,"A lot, I love it"
712,That is great. Do you have any hobbies?

712,Literature
713,I miss her so much. She moved last month.
713,I can really relate! I remember when my brother moved away years ago. It was really hard for me.
713,"Yes, it's hard because I'm unemployed and living off a trust fund. I'm going through so much."
713,music helped me when my brother moced. Who is your favorite singer?
713,Yes expensive wine helps me. I love expensive wine. My favorite singer is Anita Baker.
714,I ran into my favorite football player
714,What did you say to him?
714,"I said Namaste, I was too nervous to say something normal"
714,Oh I understand.  I once ran into a celebrity and all I could say was Hi and stare at them.
714,Which celebrity did you meet? How exciting
714,Ric Flair.  He is wrestling legend and I ran into him at a Mexican restaurant.
714,I love Ric Flair! Did he say hi back>
714,"Yeah,  he nodded hello.  He was with a lady and she said Hi.  I got so nervous"
714,I bet! I'm still waiting for Bill Murray to join my next houseparty
714,"Ha, ha, ha....He was great in the movies Stripes and Ghostbusters. "
714,He was...have you seen Groundhog Day?
714,I have but it was not one i liked.  Is that one of your favorites movies with him in it?
715,Do you even have a job?
715,"I don't , I sleep a lot and I'm in high school living the life"
715,"Oh thats cool, I'm just over here looking for a second job, what kind of work do you want to do when you're older?"
715,I want to work with computers and IT. what do you do for work
715,I am a waiter now but i dream about owning my own restaurant 
715,Wow waiters make a. lot of money. what kind of food do you want to serve at ur restaurant
715,I want to serve pizza and ice cream only at my place
715,wow I am eating pizza right now that is very cool. I love pizza
715,"Pizza is the best food really, I would eat that every day forever"
715,"Pizza is my lifeblood, along with beer."
715,I thought you were too young to drink beer? isn't that illegal?
715,I don't know. i'll just listen to bruno mars instead
716,I am an artist.
716,Are you a freelancer or do you work for a specific company?
716,I actually do both and it still does not pay well!
716,It's a tough field with a lot of competition. My job as a zookeeper has decent pay.
716,Yes it is... and very unpredictable!  What kind of animals you take care of?
716,I work with a variety of animals. I often work with lions and monkeys.
716,Oh wow... that has to be exciting!  Which is your favorite?

716,"Hmmm... don't really have a fovorite.  But i love dogs, i have 5"
716,I love dogs too! I have one dog named Scout. What breeds are your dogs?
716,four are mutts and the other is a catahoula
716,I have never heard of a catahoula. That's an odd name.
716,"Yeah, me neither before i adopted him!"
717,my dad especially has alot of this. he likes to pay attention to himself.
717,A lot are narcissists nowadays too! it's shocking how many people are like this.
717,"I know, I think its sad and just rude to be like that."
717,I think they just want others to talk that about them.
717,I agree but in a positive way. They want alot of fame and to be payed attention too.
717,"Just ignore him next time, make him suffer that the spot light isn't on him."
717,I also have a friend that is like that too. They want everyone to feel sorry for them. 
717,Sounds pretty bad. How do you dell with their egotism and vanity?
717,I just let it pass and not worry about it.
717,"That's the way to do it, unless you want to spice it up and prevoke them."
717,doing that is not a good idea. that only starts trouble.
717,Troubles temporary. It makes things interesting occasionally.
718,"it will be a new journey, a rewarding journey! how are you feeling? have you started your journey to know everything about Autism?"
718,Im still learning about it. Need to do more research.
718,"I understand, there is not enough time to know everything about Autism, learning a second language will make a stronger bond"
718,"I've also got 2 dogs that are like my babies, do you have pets?"
718,"yes, I have a white Huskey, he loves to howl every morning to wak eme out, my mom works at a bank yours?"
718,"I love my job, I work as a teacher just like my mom did. What do you do for work?"
718,"sorry for the misspelled words, that was my dog jumping on me giving his toy, wants to play. I am a stem cell engineer, I just started. "
718,That is quite interesting. Your family must be proud of you
718,"it is very tedious, how long have you been teaching? is it as difficult as I imagine"
718,"I have been teaching for about 10 years, it can be tough but thats only if the kids have terrible parents, some years are better than others."
718,"I can only imagine, I use to tutor biochemistry, I use to get very frustrated when concepts were not understood quickly enough, do you experience the same?"
718,Yes that happens as well but i have people that can help if a student is having issues
718,"I am sorry for the frustrated parents, sometimes parents forget how much teachers do, what grade you teach?"
719,"yeah and it was pretty dark and quiet,"
719,were you walking home?
719,yeah i was walking home from my waitress job. Do you have a job?
719,I do IT jobs and you?
719,I work as a waitress at fine dining restaurant. What do you like to do in your free time?
719,I am play cricket in free time. Do you play any games?
719,i like to play soccer sometimes with my friends. Do you like to travel?
719,I am like travel to visiting place in our country.
719,Ooh nice. What country are you from?
719,I am from UK and you?
719,I'm from the U.S. I've never been to the UK before.
719,I am like U.S country
720,I used to skateboard over near a bagel shop. I never went in though because they didn't like me skating around their store. 
720,That's too bad. Perhaps if they'd been nicer you would have become a customer! I like to make my own bagels.
720, I've never tried that. Seems like it would be hard. I worked at a pretzel shop for awhile and that was much harder than I thought
721,Yeah although I am sure its quite boring compared to a cattle farm
721,it's not so exciting. it can be real hard work at times. what are your hobbies?
721,I enjoy reading and surfing the internet-what are your hobbies?
721,i like to cook when i have time. i also like to read. what's your favorite book?
721,I like reading any of the Tom Clancy books
721,i've never read any of his stuff. i'll have to pick up one of his books and give it a try. do you have any pets?
721,Yes a dog-How about you-any pets?
721,"oh, nice. i have two dogs. what breed is your pooch?"
721,Beagle-what are yours?
721,i have a husky and a chocolate lab. what's your beagle's name and how old is he?
721,Mia-she's 5
721,i like the name Mia. my dogs are named Cyber and Sophie. are you married?
722,I never knew guitar strings could be made of metal. Is that common?
722,Most electric guitar strings are at least wrapped in metal. Classical guitar more commonly has nylon.
722,I never knew that. Is it painful to play without a pick?
722,Sometimes! It depends on how you're strumming and if you've built up enough callouses
722,"I was thinking of learning how to play a guitar over the summer, now I'm a little worried, haha."
722,Oh I wouldn't be. What you'll notice first in the pain in your forearm as you built strength enough to fret. You should learn!
722,Would any kind of exercises help me build forearm strength to help me as a beginner?
722,The act of playing is really the best way to train muscle while also training muscle memory. Do you have a guitar already?
722,"No, I don't, sadly. I still live with my parents, so I don't think they'd appreciate me making a lot of noise."
722,"Yeah, that can be a problem. Luckily, these days it's not too hard to plug headphones into an electric to manage the noise."
722,I was thinking more of learning how to play on an acoustic guitar. Is playing an electric guitar easier? 
722,You could do either. The necks of electric guitars tend to be slimmer and thinner so they're generally easier to fret properly
723,Yes chocolate is amazing. Did you know it has antioxidants in it?
723,I have heard that before! Dark chocolate is especially good for you.
723,Im sure you will get plenty of it at the park! 
723,"I do like to visit the park, but I didn't know there was a chocolate store near there..."
723,Hershey Pennsylvania is where Hershey's Chocolate comes from.
723,"Oh, you meant Hersheypark! That was a total blonde moment. Yes, I can't wait for the tour."
723,"My friends are from there, they always loved it."
723,I think my children will really enjoy it as well. I'll have to keep them from eating too much though!
723,Just wait for the roller coasters till after your food digest. 
723,Definitely! That would be a mess! NOT fun at all.
723,I could only imagine the photos.
723,Lol memorable for sure! I don't think I would be purchasing any of us throwing up!
724,Do you believe in fairytales
724,Yes. I do believe in fairy tales. I like Jack Sprat because I weigh 300 ponds. That tells you I like fattening food!
724,"Thats kool. Ive never heard of  Joseph Jacobs, but you sound interesting"
724,Thank You! I think I'm interesting. I can tell you all about my love for candy and soda! Sugar seems to be my fairy tale? What about you?
724,Some Dr. says Fat is good and rice and wheat is bad 
724,I can never be sure of all the dietary information that is going around. It is so confusing. I just know that I love sweets!
724,"Thats true its hard to know what to belive, but yes I love Dew and candy bars :)"
724,My son is a big fan of the Dew. I'm a Dr. Pepper girl myself.
724,"Dr. Pepper I miss those days, I used to love it "

726,Your daughter will literally save the world one day. It seems there is a strong gap between nutrition and medicine these days.
726,You're in the right field. It's so odd how people don't understand the importance of what they eat.  Do you have any hobbies?
726,"Yes, nutrition can be very tricky. My hobbies are music and computer programming, but the latter can be very frustating. How about you?"
726,"My hobby is growing fruit trees. I got too good though, and had 80 mango's this year. TOO many, lol"
726,"That is pretty neat. Magoes are one of my favorites fruits, but I have to cut back on the sugar."

734,"He's pretty smart, it only took about a week"
734,Mine took months to train forever. I was so happy when he finally learned.
734,"I love my dog, we go swimming together"
734,"That sounds super relaxing.  Swimming is nice though becasue its low impact.  less impact on your joints compared to running, i bet your dog enjoys it too"
734,I have trouble running since I lost my little toe.
734,"Ouch, I bet that is very painful"
734,It was but it's getting better. 
734,My husband broke his toe one time and it is permanently bent now! It looks pretty goofy.
734,"Sounds like it, it's probably hard to buy shoes"
734,"Yeah it can, is it hard for you to find shoes?"
734,"No, I have to pad them a little."
734,"Ah, what is it like not having your little toe anyways?"
735,It's coming along pretty well. Im trying to get it cleaned up to host a BBQ for my family.
735,"Do you do that grilling outdoors, or do you have a grill in your kitchen?"
735,No we will grill out. Im excited to host everyone.
735,My house has a big garden. Its okay for bbqs.
735,That'd be nice. Mine is small which is why we need the garage space.
735,How small is small?
735,Only about 1200 sq ft. It's enough for my husband and I though.
735,"That sound big. I don't get along with my family, so we never BBQ together."
736,I'm too old for scuba diving.  Where do you dive at?
736,A big lake near my house. I live in Kansas so the ocean is too far.
736,Nice. I live on a lake too. I'm 70 years old now and got tired of people and retired to my cabin. 
736,I'll probably do the same when I'm 70. Do you have any children?
736,I do. They all live very far away though. I don't see them much. 
736,That's too bad. My daughters are all still young. I can't imagine not having them around anymore
736,They have their own lives to live. I don't mind it. We see each other a few times a year on holidays.
736,That's the way life goes I suppose
736,It's true.  If you do a good job raising them then they leave the nest and stay gone. 
736,Well not always. I still live pretty close to my childhood home.
736,That's fine. You have your own life to live though right?
736,"Mostly, my dad's been sick lately so I've cut back hours at work to help take care of them"
737,It was awful. What do you do for a living
737,I work at a comic book store since i collect comics it works great
737,"thats cool, I'm a writer myself"

737,"All things under the sun. I dream of becoming an actress one day, writing helps me imagine different situations"
737,"Wow thats interesting, i'm just a boring guy who owns two snakes.. do you have pets?"
737,I have a dog. How many times have you been bitten?
737,"Just once in the throat, no big deal. I put him in time-out and he learned his lesson"
737,thats sweet lol
737,"yeah snakes rule, it's a popular meme"
737,"Sneks, hah. I've thought of getting one but I don't want to feed it live stuff"
737,"Yeah it's pretty brutal to watch, thats why I always turn on cartoons when it's feeding time"
738,My kids are all grown and out of the house and my wife is out of town for a week working
738,That's really tough right now. I hope you're doing something fun to keep yourself occupied.
738,"Reading, Watching TV, and surfing the internet-what do you do for fun?"
738,I read a lot. I have trouble with screens sometimes; my epilepsy can flare up and be a real pain with all the lights and whatnot.
738,"Oh, so sorry to hear that-do medications help with it?"
738,"A little bit, yeah. Mostly it's just knowing what sets them off and being prepared."
738,At least you have a pretty good idea of what to avoid
738,"That's true. It was hard after I was first diagnosed, but it's easier now. Everything gets easier with time, even missing your family."
738,That is true-just have to keep moving forward and ignore the obstacles
738,"Exactly. You should let your wife know you missed her while she was away, though. Spend some good time together when she gets back."
738,I will do that for sure-have to figure out what would be a nice night out when she gets home
738,Sometimes a dinner in is just as much fun as a night on the town. You have a good one!
739,"That sounds awesome, did the humans eventually win?"
739,I am not win this match.
739,"So now I'm confused, what kind of match are you talking about? What was the match about?"

740,"He owns a pizza parlor, which is my my favorite food is pizza! Do you have a favorite food?"
740,"wow, that sounds great. i love pizza, but my favorite food is tacos. in fact, i talk about cooking on my youtube channel. do you cook?"
740,I do. Well actually I'm just starting to get into it. Can you tell me some good recipes to try? 
740,you should go on allrecipes.com. they have user-submitted recipes that are top-notch. what have you made so far?
740,Thanks! I will check it out. I have tried a few different soups and a couple of chicken dishes. Do you have a favorite thing that you gook?
740,i actually love trying at least one new recipe every week. i get bored making the same things all the time. are you a student?

741,I'd like to visit the UK some day. Probably scotland and visit the Islay region
742,That's all I have is home time.  I've got kids. Lots of kids. 
742,That's nice and satisfying to get to spend the day with your own children! Definitely needs its breaks though.
742,Truer words were never spoken. I love them but I would like to get a break sometimes. 5 children are a lot to handle. 
742,"5 children are lot of responsibility, you definitely need a break every now and then. Is it a vacation time ?"
742,Not right now. We've got a fall break coming up soon though. 
742,"That's good. Summer break is nice, but Christmas will be magical too. Did you planned anything ?"
742,We're going to go to my parents house for Christmas. I'm looking forward to them getting some grandparent time. 
742,That's pretty cool! They sound like an awesome grandparents! :)
742,They take the kiddos off my hands for me and it allows me to have some me time. It's nice to catch up with old friends. 
742,It's always nice to catch up with old friends!
742,Yeah. A lot of my friends from high school still live in the area. 
742,Wow. That's some friends you have there. High school friends are amazing with lot of first timer.

743,My dog's name is drooly and ya he appears to seem okay. But I am kinda worried about his health
743,"Well I'm sure with you taking care of him, he'll be fine!"
743,Thanks for saying that. Vet expenses are too much these days. I guess it's because he is getting old. How about your dog?
743,"He is OK, still young. But I'll take him to the vet tomorrow for a check-up. He's a great dane, what is drooly?"
743,"drooly is a male dog. he is nice, i hope your dog is not sick"
743,Thanks! I hope he's OK too. What is drooly's favorite toy?
743,"his favorite toy is a barbie doll. I guess he likes girls so much., haha. what about you?"
743,"Haha, that's funny. Socks loves to dance, weirdly. So do I, it's my passion!"
743,That's neat. That's a stressbuster
743,Hahaha indeed!
744,No i have not. Have you?
744,"I have not but I want to one day. The explorer in me wants to visit everywhere, but such little time. "
744,"Speaking of exploring, I'm gay and still in the closet so I know what you mean, just in a different way"
744,"Oh yes, I understand completely. I have gay friends. It don't matter to me. I enjoy meeting all kinds of people"
744,As do I my friend. So what are your hobbies?
744,I like to climb mountains. There is a certain thrill to it that can't be captured anywhere else.
744,I've always wanted to try that. It sounds exhilerating!
744,"Yes, but there is a certain amount of training required. What do you like to do on your free time?"
744,Im a freak for all things anime / manga / comic
744,Very nice. Any manga or animes on mountains LOL. I like the interpersonal ones
744,Me too!. I do like to hike also
744,Hiking is wonderful exercise and time to enjoy nature. I like hiking in groups. 
745,"Yeah, but I didn't want to risk getting a ticket myself. I'm not exactly sitting on stacks of cash, lol."
745,haha i definitely understand that. Tickets can be very expensive! I've only gotten one myself.
745,"Maybe if a publisher picks up on of the comics I'm making, then I'll have some money to spend on risking tickets."
745,"Thats very neat, what sort of comics are you making? Do you do your own illustrations?"
745,"Since I'm trying to get into the business, I do all my own linework, color, lettering, etc. Hoping to work for Marvel."
745,"That is a great dream! My wife works in illustrations, she use to be an art teacher but hated the pay."
745,"Teaching is always difficult. Luckily, nowadays artists can do well by publishing their work on the internet, which is what I've been doing. "
745,"That is the beauty of the internet! It definitely has been more lucrative for her. Its also kickstarte my BBQ business, I've always loved cooking meat."
745,There's always money in the food industry. Are you looking to start a chain? 
745,"I am just wanting to get a local restraunt off the ground and if it turns into a chain, even better!"
745,I wish you luck! Better to be your own boss doing something you genuinely care about.
745,Yes the office life was just not my calling! Sitting around 8 hours a day was getting to me.
746,The barbarian
746,I like to write short stories as well. Do you have any hobbies?
746,I play bass guitar.
746,That sounds fun. I play piano. Did you teach yourself or take lessons?
746,I took lessons for three years. Are you self-taught?
746,"Yes, I am. I mostly play though, when our power goes out and my brother BBQ's which I love. It is the only time everyone is off of their devices"
746,haha! seems like everyone is wired in these days. i became so frustrated with constant notification that 
746,Now they're putting up 5G towers in my town and it's freaky. The relay stations are HUGE and the local towers look like light poles
746,i live in bfe so it will probably take a few years before we get it.
746,Probably so.  What kind of food do you like? I like BBQ
746,I'm from KC and bleed BBQ. it's my favorite too.

747,Is it any good town for a vacation?
747,Yes. I grew up in the city.
748,"But who knows maybe they have imaginary friends, I do and they keep me company"
748,imaginary friends ? that is cool i guess
748,"Yeah, I live in LA and everyone is fake imaginary is better for me, "
748,i feel extremely isolated . that's the perfect word for it. but is good to try  an make some friends.
748,im sorry i understand i live next to miley cyrus and pnb rock so its hard to find real people
748,"Wow, have you ever meet them?"
749,I'm alright! Just listened to a new audiobook last night and I really enjoyed it
749,I love audiobooks too! They make the commute fly by.
749,"Oh! Maybe we can swap recommendations, so you'll have something to do while you're stuck in bed. "
749,Yes that sounds great.
749,Do you have any preferences? I really like books about undersea adventures! 
749,I like books about philosophy. 
749,"Hmm might not know anything to recommend, I mainly read fiction. What else do you like to do?"
749,I like to play games that require a lot a deep thinking.
749,Oh neat! Do you prefer things like puzzle adventure games or just plotlines that make you think in general?
749,We games like chess or poker I mean.
750,"That's cool, I'm too lazy to work."
750,I like to be lazy as much as I can but it's hard when you have priorities.
750,I prefer watching movies to working.
750,What kind of movies do you like to watch?
750,I like to watch anything. How about you?
750,"I really like fantasy movies, like Lord of the Rings"
750,"Sweet, I love those movies too."
750,My favorite Lord of the Rings movie is The Two Towers. Which one do you like the best? 
750,I like the Fellowship Of The Ring the most.
750,"That one is good, of course.  What kind of tv shows do you like to watch?"
750,I enjoy watching reality shows like Big Brother. How about you?
750,I don't like reality TV unless it's Shark Tank. Otherwise I like Game of Thrones. 
751,"nice to meet you on here, hope you don't mind if i get to know "
751,No not at all.
751,"oh, okay "
751,Well I have 3 kids
751,oh that's good i love kids 
751,Do you have kids?
751,nope i don't yet but i hope one day i'll have my own kids lol
751,"OK, I'm also a baseball player."
751,"oh good, i like watching haven't tried it "
751,Do have any sports that you play?
751,"yea, i play Tennis "
751,"Cool, Tennis is such a difficult sport "
751,i love traveling and exploring new places 
752,"Oh that's ok. I like oranges, but I really love the skin off of apples."
752,I'm not a big fan of apples unless they are paired with caramel. Do you like caramel apples? 
752,"No, I don't like the taste of caramel. I like all kinds of fruit though, there are so many out there."
752,Do you like pomegranate? 
752,"Yes, I especially enjoy the color of it. It can be real bright at times."
752,"Yes, it is a gorgeous, vibrant red!  Do you like vegetables? "
752,"A few, but there isn't many I like. What about you?"
752,I love vegetables!  My favorite is broccoli. 
752,I don't care for it much unless it is covered in cheese.
752,Covered in cheese is the best way to eat it. Lots and lots of cheese! 
752,"Cheese is so good. I usually eat fruit before every meal too, but fruit and cheese don't mix lol."
752,"Cheese is my favorite food.  Brie goes well with some fruits, you should try it some time. "
753,I won it at the casino.
753,That is awesome.  I love gambling.  Was it a scratch off?  Pick 3?
753,I was playing the slots.  This is great because I'm in college and can use the extra money.
753,That is awesome! what do you study in college?
753,I'm in Business Management. I'm working in construction over the summers so I may want to eventually go into Construction Management.
754,The whole legal process is one of the most devastating parts of the divorce
754,"Indeed, my friend. My husband just decided to leave me. It's one of the toughest things to deal with."
754,I wish there was a better way to address parental custody.  The kids suffer quite a bit with the uncertainty
754,I think it's just the laws. We must write to congress to get them to change it. Everyone suffers.
754,I agree that something must be done legislatively to make the divorce process better for everyone involved.
754,"If people were committing to changing the system, it would work. Maybe offer incentives. I personally would like it if they offered my favorite food, ice cream!"
754,Yeah ice cream for everyone!  That could take some of the pain out of a long day in court
754,And the children would be happy. All sides benefit!
754,Do you think they should have puppies and kittens too?
754,That's a marvelous idea. Nothing but love in the air.
754,"A lot of love is needed in such a tough situation, so anything that can promote some love is good with me"
754,"Out of all the things in the world, love probably has the greatest healing power. And it's so simple. I wish things worked out better with my husband."
755,"Hi, yes I love to watch races and cheer everyone on . I used to run but not lately."
755,I started running again about 3 years ago.
755,How long do you usually run?
755,I usually run several hours a day. I find it relaxing and therapeutic. What do you do to relax?
755,"I did the 100 yard dash like I said in college, then hurt my knee a few years ago."
755,I hurt my knee too. It took me over a year to recover from that injury but now I'm better than ever
755,That's good. We do need to be able to walk for sure and knee injuries are very painful.
755,It was the worst pain that i've felt in my entire life
755,I know. I have spent many hours in waiting rooms and hospitals .
755,Have you had many injuries?
755,"I had the right knee injured from falling then shoulder injury, and broke some toes, lol."
755,"Wow, that sounds painful!! Thankfully, I've only had the knee injury"
756,It sure was. However I know I could always turn to them for any king of help.
756,"It's a blessing to have caring parents, huh?"
756,It sure is. I often miss them since I live in different city. But making new friends always helps.
756,I'm in a similar situation.. Do you have any hobbies that help you forge relationships with other people?
756,"I usually travel to different places, helping me meet new people and make new friends."
756,Awesome! What kind of places do you travel to?
756,"Sightseeing, local attractions, bars, clubs. I never miss any chance to explore when I get it."
756,Sounds like you live quite the exciting life! What do you do to finance all this traveling?
756,I work double shifts. My last trip costed me a lot therefore I had to ask my parents for the money.
756,"I see, well I'm glad you got your rent situation figured out. I'm lucky, my hobbies keep me in my apartment most of the time."
756,What kind of hobbies do you have?
756,I'm a multi-instrumentalist! I love playing music.
757,Yikes. I hope she got help. I have a sister who I hope doesn't develop those habits. Just starting out 1st grade.
757,"She did, but it was still really frustrating."
757,"I'm glad. We are all hoarders in a sense. In a way, I like hoarding food. Costco lol. Things like ice cream."
757,"I get ya, hoarding food seems kind of scary since they are perishable goods."
757,"Indeed! But we have 2 freezers, so it's all good. They can last for a while. Isn't technology just great?"
757,"Technology is amazing, I have a Roomba to vacuum my floors."
757,"My father uses that! He teaches quite a bit at middle school, so it makes it convenient for him when he goes home. It's all clean!"
757,It is so useful!
757,But we must get the good kinds. I can't stand overly processed Ice creams. There are good brands out there who use healthy and quality ingredients.
757,"True, I like the healthier ones."
757,Yes. Just takes carefull looking at the grocery store. Organic section has good ones.
757,I agree. If I get low quality ice cream it makes my back itch.
758,But what if it's something bad
758,Have you ever try to meditate?
758,I actually kinda like listening to Sinatra in situations like this
758,Oh you like him a lot? I think Frank Sinatra is an icon!
758,"Yea his music soothes me in this situation, i hope it all goes smootly. What are you up to ?"

764,"I know it's not the same as a slab of beef, but you can definitely load a burrito with steak."
764,They are very similar but yeah i defenetly love steak way more than fish steak
764,What is fish steak?
764,sort of like what a piece of salmon cut into a steak like substance...
764,"I think I see what you're getting at. So, do you have any hobbies outside of steak appreciation?"
764,yes I like to work with wood...make arts and crafts
764,"Oh, that's awesome! I've always wanted to try my hand at woodworking. Could you describe your latest project?"
764,I took a boards..glued them together and painted on them
764,Sounds simple enough. I like hiking around outdoors and hanging around with trees before they become boards.
764,Yes I agree. Hiking is therapy to one's spirit...especially now that fall is here..
764,"Yeah, the colors are starting to get really inspiring, seeing your breath and getting some exercise. It's great!"

765,To get a buzz and kill time until my dad gets home 
765,"oh, do you drink a lot"

769,i enjoy watching fighter jets in movies
769,Me too - there was an episode that was on HBO. It was interesting.
769,i don't have much energy to watch HBO anymore

769,i mainly just watch a lot of movies on netflix
769,what kinds of shows do you like to stream ?
770,oh okay. what kind of music do you like? 
770,"I know the most generic answer is ""a little bit of everything,"" but it's true. Lately, i've been listening to a lot of ambient/drone. You?"
770,i hardly get time to be honest. I like pop and r&B
770,"Oh, cool. What keeps you so busy?"
770,Work mostly! you ever been to Hawaii?

773,how are the prices?
773,"The prices can get high on certain things, but I usually go for sale items."

774,That sounds so relaxing.  Do you have any pets?
774,"Yes, I have a cat! She loves to play with yarn while I crochet."
774,"I also adore cats, have two of my own."
774,Oh yeah? What are their personalities like?
774,One is grumpy all of the time and the other always gets into trouble. They are my babies. How about yours?
774,Mine is a little Calico who likes to act more shy around strangers than he really is. He's a kneader.
774,I can't wait to get my hair done today.
774,What kind of style are you going for?
774,"I'm getting bangs, kind of nervous about it."

776,"yes , but it is worth it , i promise"
776,how much did it cost
776,I don't recall the exact amount
776,was it worth it ?
776,Its worth the payment! For beauty sake
776,Are you beautiful ? I think i am because my parents always told me that since i am the only child. I feel hot
776,"i'm sure you are beautiful , all women are beautiful"
776,No i'm a man

777,"nice, is he friendly"
777,"Yeah, he's super sweet and playful."
777,does he have name yet
777,"Battu, I am a ballet dancer and wanted to give homage to that."
777,"oh ok, i guess you dont want to discuss your dog anymore"
777,No. Thanks
778,I will find him and make him pay
778,I could lend you a piano in the meantime.
778,I don't want yours i want that specific one
778,"Okay, I was just offering. I have a few, I've been playing since I was 6."
778,"Are you good ? i would learn but i  am anti social and i would not want to go take piano lessons with anyone, i even work from home"
778,I like to think so. You could take online lessons.
778,I'm too shy
778,"Shy? Yeah, I get that. I was too, until I started getting out more. The ability to socialize is a muscle you have to work at."
778,"I'm also too shy to look at myself in the mirror, "
778,I completely understand. A lot of people struggle with having confidence in one's self.
778,I am trying hard to fix it
778,you can do it . keep working hard .
779,"i felt bad for the guy, he looked a bit sad"
779,Why do you think he was sad? He should ride a bike with a dog.
779,"he just didnt seem happy doing his tricks, as if he did not care"
779,Wow thats strange. Have you ever done tricks on a bike?
779,"nope, I dont really use it that often"
779,Oh well that's cool too. It's better to just walk the dog anyway. Do you like dogs?
779,I do! do you own any?
779,I have a couple. They rock my world. Great for easing the nerves.
779,"absolutely, how old are they?"
779,They're brothers so they're both 5.
779,"thats awesome, go take them out!"
779,I think I will do that. It's a beautiful day!
780,I felt out of place because I have a few tattoos on my face.
780,"Oh, that is bold lol. Tattoos have been regarded as uncivilized in the Wet. People tend to associate them with criminals or people with mental issues"
780,"Yeah, I'm not crazy but I made a few mistakes when I was younger."
780,Mistakes happen but it's good you are learning from it. We all make mistakes
780,"It was a good office job, perhaps I should use some kind of makeup to cover it up for a future job. Do you work?"
780,i do but do to this only job for source of income it has been tough
780,I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things get better.
780,"Thanks, yea things always get better"
780,Do you have any hobbies?
780,"Yes a little, like fishing and hiking "
780,That sounds like fun. I mostly listen to podcasts.
780,"i do too , i like podcasts . i listen to historical ones"
781,no i'm a plumber not a photographer! 
781,You could still figure out how to take decent pictures.
781,My memory is good enough and I was in a hurry.
781,"I probably wouldn't even have noticed the guy, I can't see very far in front of me."
781,You should get your eyes check out
781,I have. I have glasses but I forget them all the time.
781,You could put them around your neck like one of my 4h members does.
781,"maybe , perhaps while i beat my drum ?"
781,Were you the guy with the trashcan?
781,Wouldn't that be a funny story if I were?
781,I would have you come play for my members if you were!
781,"Sure, That's sounds like a real plan. lol"
782,"Yep, I reallyhave blond hair"
782,"You should dye it. So many blonde colors to choose from, reddish strawberry blonde to golden-brownish sandy blonde color."
782,Why? I prefer to keep my hair natural.
782,"I don't blame you, dye can destroy your hair."
782,yeah it can
782,It is also expensive.
782,Unless you get the cheap do it yourself kits at the store
782,yes just buy the hair color and the instruction is all there .
782,yep
782,Would you ever do it?
782,"Nope, as I said before I like to keep my hair natural"
782,Your hair must grow really quick!
783,Oh I like playing computer games every now and then when I have time.
783,That's cool.  I'm not good at those games.  My favorite game is Halo.  What's yours?
783,If I had to pick I'd probably choose Minecraft. I'm always playing it at my computer and in bed.
783,Good choice.
783,The other day I was playing and my dogs got surprised when they heard barking coming from my game. That was pretty entertaining.
783,haha . i'd rather stay home and watch tv .
783,I tend to be a homebody too. I'm always in bed with my dogs listening to music or playing games.
783,My dogs keep me sane.
783,I can relate to that. Mine are my best friends.
783,And that is good too. They are 
783,They definitely are. Dogs love you unconditionally. I'm not surprised they help keep you stable.
783,"they sure do, always"
784,ok
784,Do you have anything to add?
784,good
784,"OKay, have a good day!"
784,colourful day
784,This was the most fun chat Ive had today. Enjoy yur day!

784,"thanks , nice chatting with you"
784,god bless you dear
784,god bless you too sir
784,thank you dear bye see you
784,ok thank you bye
785,I'm sorry to hear that. Are you okay?
785,I think I'll survive. I just dropped out of school and my parents aren't being very sympathetic.
785,"I totally understand where you are coming from, my parents are educators."
785,Oh yeah? What do they teach?
785,My dad teaches history and my mom teaches English. What do you plan on doing?
785,"Right now I just plan on figuring out a way to survive. Eventually, I would like to work with non-profits to help solve the homeless crisis."
785,That sounds like a noble deed. Sometimes my roommates make me want to find a new place.
785,Why is that? Do they have bad habits?
785,They smoke and play loud music. It gets annoying at times.
785,I can definitely relate to that. Do you work or are you in school?
785,I just work at the coffee shop. High school was more than enough for me.
785,I can definitely relate to that. Do you enjoy your job?
786,I usually get ready pretty quickly. What are you usually getting ready for?
786,kids start school
786,"Oh, you have kids. How old are they?"
786,12 and 5 ... and they both take forever to get ready
786,"I'm sure, kids are always a handful. Does having children leave you any time for hobbies?"
786,Not really ... my hobby is taking care of the kids
786,And it's a noble one at that. Do you have any pets?
786,no ... no pets. I hate clutter or dust or any kind of mess around the house
786,"I don't like animals either, their hair gets into everything."
786,True dat ... :-) How about kids? Do you have any?
786,"Nope, I'm out here all alone, but I love the peace and quiet."
786,So are you a morning person?
787,"Yes, i instantly started singing a song about how bad it hurt.."
787,"That's funny, how did the song go?"
787,I can't quite remember.. I was listening to music while I was singing!
787,What kind of music do you like?
787,Anything with a nice beat to it really.. What do you like?
787,I like listening to rock music when I'm laying by the lake.
787,That sounds amazing.. Music makes everything better to me..
787,Do you have any hobbies? I like to watch sports on tv.
787,I mainly just enjoy sining songs.
787,Do you happen to play any instruments?
787,No I don't.. I mainly just listen.. I wish I did!
787,I think reading is a fun hobby.
788,Well I work in finance so I love doing anything that helps me with saving some money or helping others do the same.
788,What do you do when you live paycheck to paycheck?  How can you save?
788,"Well for starters, you should move closer to your job so you can walk there to save money, like me!"
788,"i've a job in finance . if you need help budgeting while you shop , let me know ."
788,"Well finance is my specialty, I don't think I'll be needing any help from you!"
789,"Yes, I like to sit around and drink beer. What about you?"
789,playing basketball is my favorite .
789,Wow that sounds fun.. I play basketball while waiting for my wife to finish cutting clients hair somedays.
789,where do you work ? i always pound back a beer when i finish .
789,"I work at a distrubition center, but for their finance department. I love Coors light the best!"
789,I was not aware that Coors beer sold its malted milk to Mars candy company. Did you?
789,No I did not.. That sounds very interseting.. Can you elaborate on that?
790,I wonder what is best novel is.
790,I love Stphen King.. I think you should deifnitely read something from him!
790,Can you recommend your favorite Stephen King book?

790,The Da Vinci Code is excellent.
790,"I will definitely give that a read then, how long will it take me to read you think?"
790,"I couldn't put it down once I started, so not long I imagine!"
790,"Yes, I am definitely someone who likes to read for hours and hours on end myself."
791,I misssed playing poll when there is an emergency

791,I am a teacher and I also fear for my students
791,Why do you fear your sudents.. I hate school because of how I am trated.

791,I teach art. It is my lifelong passion
791,Its good career. I love sclpture art. They have more talents
791,"Not true! There is no such thing like thta.Art is art,regardless what type it is "
791,"I do agree, art can be appreciated on so many differnt levels. "
791,"Yes, and that is way my life is arounf art and teaching"
792,That is great though!  Still really good for the soul.
792,You bet! What do you do that is good for your soul?
792,I love to write actually!
792,That's awesome! What kind of writer are you?
792,Creative writing actually. I teach it too!  How do you feel about writing?
792,"I enjoy reading/writing poetry, actually."
792,that is awesome!  What do you write about?
792,"Poetry is an emotional outlet for me, so it's really just variations on that theme usually."
792,It really is another great thing for you.  What other hobbies do you have?
792,I love to cook! How do you feel about cooking?
792,I love it too!  All kinds!
792,Wow! We certainly have a lot in common! I'm making bacon/cheddar croquettes and sauteed brussels sprouts for dinner. How about you?
793,"Yes, he loves the sport more than anything.. It keeps him out of trouble for sure!"
793,I agree with you. My son  currently plays quarterback position for his  high school team
793,Wow that is so awesome! Sometimes I am working late as a yoga instuctor so it is good to have him there where I know he is safe.
793,Really? I love yoga but haven't had time to sign up for class recently.
793,"It is something that you should always make time for, it makes your body so much stronger and healthier!"
793,I totally agree. The fact is that I'm trying to start a new business and it's eating up all of my time.
793,Well something crazy like that is always going to be worth it in the end.. I hope it works out for you like my Yoga has for me!
793,I appreciate it. I'm putting my effort into a gaming startup company. I'll definitely consider adding yoga to my schedule
793,Wow! I would love to come to one of those to blow off some stress myself!
793,"Yeah, the gaming industry itself is really entertaining but there's so much stress behind the scenes."
793,"For sure, I would love to come and spend some time and watch how you work!"
793,"Thank you. I'd love to send you an invite for our ""gaming premiere"""
794,Yes.. It still makes me upset.. I am hoping they will go see the sunset with me tonight. Those are my favorite.
794,I enjoy watching the sunset when I can as well.
794,"Yes, some nights I will just sit there for hours and think as it goes down."
794,I enjoy watching the sunset over the ocean. 
794,"Yes, something I also enjoy just as much is watching the sun rise.. Some months I don't miss a single day!"
794,Have you ever seen a sunrise or a sunset from another country? 
794,"Yes! I have before on a cruise, it felt way more beautiful.. I would do anything to get to see it agaun!"
794,"Yes, that is the best. I love watching sunsets or sunrises from a cruise ship."
794,"Yes, it is by far one of my best memories"
794,Where did you go on your cruise?
794,"I went to Hawaii! It was 10 days long and it was awesome, I woudl love to go back! "
794,I would love to go to Hawaii as well. Maybe one day I will get there. 
795,I love to go fishing.. Ever since my parents divorce it has really helped me.
795,That 's great that it helps you! What type of music do you like?
795,Anything calm.. Classical is my faovrite because it helps me when I study. What about youself?
795,"I like all genres of music, but my favorite is listening to metal music. It actually calms me down! lol"
795,"Wow! I have heard some people say that, although it is very crazy sounding to me!"
795,I guess it has to do with the way our brains are wired. I have ADHD so it figures it would calm me down.
795,"Yes, that definitely makes sense to me! Some kids at my school listen to that aound me as I study."
795,I have always been a rocker. It shows in my love of big hair and my closet full of leather clothes.
795,Wow! That's so great to show the music you like from your clothing style!
795,Are you a student or a teacher?
795,I am currently a student. I do very well in school with great grades.
795,I am a student also. There are all types of people attending my university. What about yours?
796,Yes. I try to be a good role model myself. 
796,there arent a lot of dedicated people like you. keep it up
796,"I completely agree. I try to present myself as having acheived a lot, but still down to earth. How about you?"
796,You have to work hard and get good at something and I try the best I can
797,Gosh that was such a great album.  My son and I really got into that band together.
797,"Yea, they first took off with their album Night Visions in 2012"
797,"Is that the album that the song, Radioactive, was on?"
797,Yes. I love their music.
797,Are there any other bands that you're a fan of?
797,"Yes, Breaking Ben is great, I traveled to Canada on the weekends to see the view and some of their concerts"
797,Are they originally a Canadian band?
797,"They're American, but travel everywhere. They inspired me and I hope I'll be able to compete on a professional level soon"
797,What are you trying to compete professionally in?
797,Music. Maybe I'll be able to at least qualify for a huge event.
797,"Well cool.  My son and I love listening to music, maybe we'll see one of your shows one day!"
797,I hope so. It's great you and your son have such a great relationship!
798,I voted for Hillary Clinton because I love hiking and so does she. How about you?
798,"I am honestly not a fan. I am a Republican myself. But, I'm looking forward to Fall and Halloween, my favorite Holiday!"
798,Will you dress up for Halloween?
798,"Definitely! Probably of one of my favorite alternative rock singers, since I really love alternative rock."
798,"That's awesome! I love rock music, once I went with my three brothers as the Beatles for Halloween!"
798,"nice,the Beatles rock too! How about this year?"
798,Maybe a solo costume this year. David Bowie would be cool.
798,"Agreed, that would be badass. I think I'll go with the singer of Disturbed!"
798,Would you go bald for it or are you already prepared?
798,I would cheat and get one of the bald wigs! 
798,"Yeah, that'd be a big commitment to shave your head just for a costume. Are you going to a party, or just handing out candy at home or something?"
798,I have a party at a friend's house. How about you?
799,"Yes, they found footprints"
799,Wow I am so sorry to hear that.  This has to be frustrating
799,It is very frustrating. I wish I had installed an alarm system.
799,I agree and I think you should. That is such a violation
799,I think I will get a dog to give me a sense of protection
799,"That is smart, I think that is the best bet"
799,I wonder what breeds are good guard dogs.
799,any i guess . The sound enough would scare someone off in my opinion
799,"Yes, the bark could ward off invaders as well as the ""Beware of Dog"" sign"
799,I think you are right
799,Do you have any advice on recovering from a robbery?
799,I think the dog is a good idea and the alarm system but I also think forming an alliance with your neighbors so you look out for each other
800,"Well, she was scammed through phishing and no way of getting it back. I went to Princeton and still couldn't help her. That happened to you before?"
800,"Yeah, I used to couch surf in Europe for a bit, and I've definitely been scammed by people a bunch of times."
800,"It's a terrible thing, I'm sorry for you. couch surfing in Europe sounds fun though. Was it great?"
800,"It was so awesome. When I was in Russia,  I started dying my hair blonde, so that people might think I was from there and scam me less."
800,YOU ways to protect yourself should be used. I've been listening to Bach and other classical music to help lessen my stress from my mom's phishing scam she went through.
800,"Oh, I like Bach, too! Magnificat, his biblical canticle, the first of its kind."
800,It's amazing! That kind of music really takes away the stresses of daily life. Are things better for you now?
800,"I am doing a lot better now, thank you!"
800,Great. I hope one day I can go to Europe. Any suggestions of places to visit?
800,Anywhere you want! Where would you go if you could choose ?
800,"Definitely France! I guess that's quite common, huh?"
800,"Yes, and it's not very crowded, which I like that. It's actually the least populated country in Europe."
801,"At least I got the discounts, now I can use the money I saved to go out this weekend! What do you like to do?"
801,I watch musical tv. I like the show catching up with kardashians. 
801,"Yeah, we always have that on the TV in the pizza place where I work part time. Seems like a weird choice but it's a decent show."
801,Did you know Kim is married to Kanye West?
801,Yaaas of course. Do you think they are a good match?
801,I think so. They have a beautifu family together. 
801,What do you like to do for fun? I love to party.
801,"I like going out to eat, then to the movies. Where have you partied before? "
801,"The UK, Egypt, typical stuff. What kind of food do you like?"
801,I love south African cuisine. Have you tried Kenyan? 
801,"No, what kinds of things are particular to Kenyan food?"
801,The food is very spicy. You should try it. 
802,"My cousin had a trditional upbringing whereas, I was raised by 2 mothers. Maybe that's why I don't do well in sports! lol"
802,Not everyone is good at sports-I'm sure you have your special talents
802,I think I do. My boyfriend says so anyway. He is very smart and works  for nasa! Wish I had that job. What do you do for a living?
802,I work in Real Estate-not very exciting certainly not like NASA
802,One of my mothers is a Realtor. She loves it. I have learned a lot about the market from her. How long have you been a Realtor?
802,Almost 15 years-now.  What kind of work do you do?
802,I am a full-time student and I work part-time as a tutor in Writing and grammar. 
802,Are you studying English in school?
802,No. I am a Biology major with a minor in computer science.
802,What type of job are you hoping to get after school?
802,"I hope for anything science related, maybe DNA research. I really want to get into Bioinformatics, but I will need more school!"
802,Those sound like very interesting fields
803,Yeah but I don't trust those apps.  They violate your privacy.
803,"Yes, no doubt about that! I do worry about privacy issues!"
803,"Hey!  Back to what we were talking about, what food do you like?"
803,I like Italian food
803,Ever had lutefish at an Italian restaurant?  It's the best.
803,No I've never heard of lutefish
803,Yep.  It's a bit of a rarity but well worth looking for it.  You want to come with me next week to eat it?
803,"Sure, but I'm definitely ordering pasta in case I don't like the lutefish!"
803,Ha!  You're funny.  I think there's a Marduk concert going on as well.  Are you a Marduk fan?
803,"Not really, but I hope you have a good time"
803,Well what music do you like?
803,I listen to a lot of jazz
804,"Yeah I do, but i love music more"
804,"I love reading the Game of Thrones books, they have a series of them. I like music too. What's your favorite?"
804,I like Game of Thrones too. Good stuff. Like to read it with a nice drink.
804,Sounds like a good plan. I love the Walking Dead. Do you like watching it?
804,Yes. Like to watch it while drinking cuba libre
804,"Well, Cubra Libre might make the Zombies seem like they're right there with you! Is that your favorite drink?"
804,YEs. I like to drink it while watching shows or performing at the theater
804,Cool. What kind of theater performances?
804,music
804,Sounds like a good time. Do you have a preferred genre?
804,rock and roll
804,"cool . i love rock , alternative , rap , you name it . But, I don't care for country music at all."
805,"I think she did. It was hard to tell, but I believe she did. I think she also liked having my cat, KJ, on her lap."
805,"Now, that is what happens when you are a cat lover."
805,She was! :-)
805,How many years have you had your cat?
805,8. She's getting a little gray around the whiskers.
805,"Awwwn, what is her color?"
805,Tortoise shell.
805,I have always wanted one of those! They are very charming.
805,"She's adorable! My only complaint is she likes to wrap herself around my legs when I'm cooking, which i do alot. Do you have pets?"
805,"No, but i think it would be cool if i get one"
805,"Do you want a cat, a dog, or something else?"
805,"I prefer them both really, "
806,Did they even taste like bread?
806,yeah i think it does..but it melts in the mouth easier
806,"I wonder if it tasted like mystery flavor, that is my favorite. What is yours?"
806,i prefer the chocolate fudge...what do you think about that?
806,I think it is also a good choice. It is always hard for me to pick.
806,that is always my go to flavor.... i don't think twice about it
806,"I see all the cake and get too excited and then argue with myself about what I want. That's why I like mystery, you never know what it will be."
806,i like that idea too but i also hope it does not turn out to be a flavor i do not like
806,"Well, it does help if you like all cake."
806,yeah it really does
806,Good thing i'll always love cake!
806,they are hard to hate
807,Six Flags. I'm so lucky.
807,Your are so lucky! Is that the one in Texas?
807,"Yup. We don't get to go that often, so it's a real treat to go."
807,It sure sounds fun. I live in a city but we don't have an amusement park nearby so I'm jealous of you.
807,It's still pretty far. But roller coasters are my favorite ride. What's yours?
807,"I like roller coasters for sure, but especially anything that turns me upside down."
807,"Those are the best. Do you have any plans to visit an amusement park, even though it's not nearby?"
807,Not at the moment. I'm going to spend my weekend helping my neighbor. But at some point I'll get out of town for some fun!
807,Your neighbor is lucky to have someone like you helping them!
807,"I appreciate them too.  They're old and have been a source of wisdom in my life, so I enjoy giving back to them now that they need it."
807,That's great. Reminds me of how I feel of my family.
807,Absolutely. This person feels like family to me.  Do you live close to your family?
807,"Not much family, just my adopted family"
808,"Well my dad gave me this cheap car, and I think it's letting out some weird fumes."
808,Cars are a pretty big hobby of mine! Have you thought about teaching yourself how to fix the fumes? 
808,That would be a great idea. I always have a ton of energy so maybe I could learn.
808,"You should try it out. How do you always have energy? I work in a big company, so I lack energy a lot."
808,"I'm just really skinny and energetic, I'm not sure! It's impressive to work in a big company though."
808,Thanks. Do you have a job?
808,"I'm looking for one right now, so I can save to get a better car!"
809,"I can't believe the fire burned my house down. I've never had to work, but now I might."
809,I'm sorry its driven you to work
809,"It's rough, right? I haven't worked a single day in my life. What about you?"
809,I have worked since i was 14 years old.
809,Wow that's an early age. What do you do?
809,I run a campground
809,"My brother and sister in law stay at campgrounds sometimes. She dislikes me, though, I'm not sure why."
809,That is fun they stay at campgrounds - but sad that she doesn't like you. 
809,Well I can be a pain sometimes haha! What's the best part about running a campground?
809,Getting to be in nature and help people have fun on their time off. Have you been camping?
809,"A few times, but never in the woods. Is it dangerous?"
809,Not really if you know some basic things.
810,I'm a worrier and a planner and always have been. I guess it's just part of that Type A personality. What about you?
810,I am a Type A also. I think this stems from my childhood. I never knew my dad and this has caused me to behave more strongly.
810,I'm sorry to hear that. It must have been hard growing up. I can see how that would make someone want to have a plan and know what to expect.
810,"It was hard, but I am a better person because of it. Do you have kids?"
810,"I do, I have a three year old daughter and a sixteen month old son. They are a handful!"
810,Wow-That's great! I want children one day! I have 3 tattoos now and I want to add my children's names to one of them!
810,"That's cool, what are your tattoos of? I don't have any but have considered getting something small."
810,"I have 2 that are quotes and one is of a heart, cross and raven intertwined. Mine are not large. "
810,"I like the idea of a meaningful quote or my kids' names. I also love animals, so an animal tattoo would be cool."
810,Maybe you could incorporate your kids names with the animal or quote. The possibilities are endless. 
810,"It's definitely an idea I've been entertaining. I don't think my boss would mind if it was visible, so that's not really a consideration."
810,You have a good boss. I have mine where they can be covered in case of an employer!
811,For the better...I'm still insecure though.
811,How are you working towards improving that?
811,By working harder....but i work too many hours.
811,Working hard can be healthy in moderation.
811,"Yes, in moderation....What's your story?"
811,I like working hard too
811,What else is going on with you?
811,I am going to watch an UFC fight tonight.
811,That's awesome.....seeing those strong dudes makes me insecure.
811,Seeing strong dudes inspires me to work out.
811,i don't have time...too many working hours.
811,I understand that. Work can be all-consuming.
812,He was in college for 4 years.
812,"That's great, what did he study?"
812,He studied Business Management with a minor in Vet Sciences.  He loves animals!
812,That's an interesting combination.  Is he going to continue his education and become a vet?
812,"Yes, I think he's going to."
812,Where did he graduate from? 
812,He graduated from Northwestern.  He's glad to be finished with school for a little while.
812,"Oh, wow.. that's way far from where I live. I wish had the self-discipline to go to college. "
812,"Me too!  I like to learn but I'm getting too old.  I love animals though, so I hope he becomes a vet."
812,"That would be great, I love animals, too!"
812,It was really great talking to you!
812,"Same, here, have a great day!"
813,The plants are amazing
813,"Yes, they're truly incredible. I learned a lot about plants in school and always found it fascinating"
814,Oh wow! I've heard that there are courses online for that. How did you get a degree?
814,I went to a 4-year university for my degree. I am a woman so I went to an all female school.
814, I'm taking courses online for contracting so maybe I can afford a house one day. You sound successful!
814,That is a great thing to strive for. It is always best to own. What type of music do you like?
814,"I really like Prince, Jack White, The Grateful Dead. I collect vinyl. How about you?"
814,My favorite band is Radiohead and believe it or not The Dead is my 2nd favorite. We have music in common!!
814,Radiohead is AWESOME Thom is the man! I've seen them live!
814,"You are so right! Most people think I'm crazy for liking them since I am a woman but, I have always loved their sound!!"
815,what kind of car?
815,its a nice honda civic . i lease it
815,what color?
815,It is blue. it is my first car
815,nice! I don't like smaller cars. I have a bigger car
815,what is your brand
815,hyandui santa fe
815,do you lease it?
815,"No, I am paying it off though to own it soon."
815,that is great. i like going out with my friends
815,what do you guys do?
816,Ohh i am like also

816,I am like as pet
816,What do you do for a living?
816,give foods
817,That sounds fun! I'm an only child and had wished many times I had someone to camp with as a kid.
817,Camping only recently became popular as a recreational activity. I credit the Boy Scouts with developing the love of it!
817,"Yes, Boy Scouts sure did! Were you in them?"
817,"I was in girl scouts, and my brother was in boy scouts."
817,"That's fun I'm sure. My parents divorced early, caused me not not believe in love anymore, so I'm still alone"
817,Eh my parents have been married three times each. I still believe in love.
817,"That's great. Maybe I'll change my mind one day, or find it."
817,it will happen ! you'll meet the right person someday .
817,One can hope. Are you married?
817,Not yet but soon
817,Wonderful. Y'all every go camping? It's so fun
817,Yes and I work in a campground
818,ok i'm trying to relax

818,some peoples activities is anger me
818,Oh yeah? What kind of activities?
818,all are likely
819,I love kids too! How many do they have?
819,haha its quite a handful i've indeed have quite a few about ten nieces and nephews what alot!
819,I moved into an apartment recently close to my job. There's a school nearby and I hear them every morning!
819,hahaha I bet they do! what do they enjoy doing for fun?
819,Probably playing Fortnite and doing kid stuff. When I was a child we played outside.
819,"that's a lot of work ! i played outside a lot , i love that i love the outside"
819,Do you feel it's made you a happier person? Kids today are crazy with the school shootings. Never happened in the 80s
819,"yes , i grew up with them , but not like this . they seem more extreme now and more frequent"
819,It's unfortunate. It's a reason I conceal carry but I'm a Texan. I wish the world was safer. You seem like a good person.
819,"yeah it gives me the confidence that I can definitely provide for, protect and defend my family,you seem great  too"
819,Absolutely. I'd love to see Beto come try to disarm Texas LOL
819,lol i did not even think about that lol I guess he would have to try really hard
820,They weren't returned! I had to replace everything including my barbie gift card! 
820,That has happdened tome before I never get back everthing I lost either.
820,It is a bad feeling. Especially being a girl who has a wallet full of STUFF/JUNK!! lol
820,Don't feel to bad it has hapened to the best of us.
820,I'm trying to get over the feeling of loss! I really like barbies and my wallet had a barbie gift card in it. That makes me sad!
820,My son is blind so he loses his things all the time I guess you can get use to it after a while.
820,Oh...sorry to hear that! I feel bad about complaining! How old is your son?
820,He turned Thirteen last month.
820,I remember being 13.......If I may ask.....Was he born blind?
820,Know he was sturk by a car when he was seven and the brain injury caused his blindness.
820,OMG.....I'm so sorry! That must make his disability harder than not knowing what it's like to see.  
820,hev has come along way since the tragedy happened.
821,i resort to being with my cat when annoyed.
821,"I get that, cats are cool. I have to go do a public speech tomorrow and my nerves are very upset now."
821,relax. it is the best thing
821,"I know it probably is the best way, but I always feel like people are staring at me."
821,try ignore that feeling and give your best
821,"I will. I'll definitely look my best in public, since I feel like all eyes are on me. How's your job?"

821,i wish you all the best
821,Thanks! I wish you and your cat the best!
822,sorry about that
822,"Oh yeah, and even Anaphylaxis can occur as well."
822,what does anaphylaxis mean?
822,It's when eclampsia has progressed to the point that your blood no longer clots and then your organs begin shutting down.
822,that sounds terrible.
822,It is a dangerous and horrible situation. Wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.
822,sorry again. you got any hobbies?
822,I do. I enjoy playing golf the most.
822,do you do it professionally?
822,I play golf but not professionally. I'm not good enough for that.
822,you can wok on it
822,"I've thought about it before. I might be able to if I devote enough time to it, but I'm not sure I'd ever be good enough."
823,I like travelling but I have never been outside the USA

823,I use to play football years ago. Any favorite team in the NFL?
824,"I know Football has many fans, but I love instruments. I begun learning the piano at age 10, and never stopped playing!"
824,"Wow, that's really cool. Do you play any other instruments?"
824,"No, I solely focused on the piano. Do you play anything?"
824,"I've played around on the guitar and learned a couple chords, but I'm just a beginner. I would love to learn to play that or drums though."
824,"The drums are pretty great too. I don't have much time for the piano nowadays, as I am a nurse."
824,I would imagine not! You probably have an extremely busy schedule. What type of nurse are you?
824,"I'm an ER nurse. The hospital stays full of emergencies, so there's not a free moment. What do you do?"
824,"I work as a loan officer at a bank, actually. It's interesting work, but probably not nearly as exciting as what you see daily."
824,"I'm sure it is interesting, definitely important to people's lives. Have you been doing it long?"
824,About eight years now. I love being able to help people achieve their dreams. Getting someone a loan for their first home or a start-up business is the best.
824,"That was my point, definitely important involvement in people's lives for sure. That's pretty awesome!"
824,"I like it, and the hours are a definite bonus. I have small children, so it's important for me to have time to spend at home."

825,yes of course.the way of preparation slightly changed.but i like it both pizza.do u like meats?
825,"Oh yes, When ever I order pizza I order the sausage toppings. It's so delicious. What do you order?"
825,i ordered pizza with sweet corn or mushroom toppings.i just loved it entirely
825,Oh wow! Sweet Corn. I didn't know you could order Sweet Corn on your pizza. I've eaten Sweet Corn with my meals but never on a pizza.

827,From cali. I have a furniture store there. Interesting area.
827,nice are you male?
827,Yes I am. You?

827,"Very nice. That store in cali sells furniture, but sometimes I gotta custom make orders and build from scratch at times"
827,i understand. how much are prices for couch?
827,Depends on how much you want to pay. There are good ones for around 200. Luxury ones will cost more than 3k
827,you ship world wide?
827,"Sometimes, it's really expensive though. People place special orders that I have to build."
828,Who is your favorite country artist?
828,"billy ray cyrus, how about yourself"
828,I like Jason Aldean
828,I'm not familiar with him where is he from
828,"He is from Georgia. He's a very popular country artist, you might have heard his music and not realized it."
828,Wow that is awesome. I am from Georgia myself!
828,"Oh, really? That's cool.  I am from Texas! "
828,What part of texas are you from?
828,I'm from the Dallas area
828,"Being in Dallas, are you a Cowboys fan?"
828,Of Course I am a big Cowboys fan!  I'm happy we won against the Eagles last night!
828,I'm glad they won!
829,It was amazing. I had a cheesecake.
829,"Their menu is huge. I don't know what I would pick from there. After eating authentic Japanese food all my life, I tend to be picky about Asian cuisine."
829,I am a very picky person unfortunately so I don't eat a lot of different foods. What's your favorite Asian food?
829,"Ooohh,, that's a tough one. I love the dumplings my makes at home best, probably."
829,"Hmm, home cooking is usually better than what you can get out and about."
829,Agreed! What's your favorite home cooked dish?
829,"Hmm, I like a good chili this time of year. Seems like everyone has their own recipe though but it's always good to try them all."
829,"Ooohh, another one of my favorites. Nothing beats a bowl of chili on a cold day."
829,Definitely. I am getting hungry now.
829,"Me too! It's cold and rainy here today, perfect day for some comfort food. "
829,Is it? It just started to rain and cool down here as well. Time to hunker down and get cooking!
829,I'll have to get off work first :( Kind of makes me wish I had started something in the slow cooker this morning!
830,"Okay, that seems like fun. I know that group. They look interesting."
830,"Yes, they are pretty far out there. I'm a tall, blond and reserved gal, so don't seem like the regular fan."
830,"Awesome. I'm sort of afraid of heights so, i hope the concert is nowhere high up."
830,"No, front row! While the ICP may be my best band, what's yours?"
830,My favorite band is probably gonna have to be Radiohead. All time favorite.
830,That's a great band. Have you been to a concert?
830,"no, i really want to though. i have all of their albums."
830,"Yes, I think they began in 85, is that right?"

830,I don't have a particular one. I enjoy classic rock too. DO you?
831,Oh wow. 1927. They've made so many variations of it as well. Not sure if I want chili corn or cheesy hog dog.
831,"i can never decide . . . either a cheesy hot dog , or a chili corn dog ."
831,"Choices, choices, food choices are always difficult. I often decide on the way to work. it's a lonnnng drive."
831,There are so many regional variations of hot dogs. What do you like to eat on yours?
831,"Some days cheese, other days chili. And sometimes both!"
831,Chili cheese fries are delicious! I like to dip it in ketchup and mustard!
831,Some days chili. Other days cheese. Sometimes both!
831,i always have this thing where i cant decide between a chili corn dog or cheese dog
831,"Definitely, my friend. I sometimes order on the drive to work. It can take a few hours and then I'm hungry."
831,That sounds really delicious right now
831,"Hey we all have to eat. Might as well eat good food, right?"
831,You got that right. You have to live your best life!
832,No. Not in a long while
832,"Wow, that must be stressful for someone who values family"
832,"Yes, and we used to share the same favorite meal"
832,wow your Aunt really cared for you to cook food for you.
832,"Maybe, I love the meal especially on a rainy day"
832,It's great that your aunt cares about you so much.
832,"Its what anyone will want, what about you?"
832,I want you to love your Aunt unconditionally.
832,"That's great, then you must definitely be a family lover?"
832,I am. Probably more than I can handle!
832,Then you must be a pizza lover like my Aunt too i guess?
832,indeed . everyone loves pizza that has a soul!
833,Hmmmm...interesting.  How do you hunt lizards?
833,No I do not. Do you hunt lizards?

833,That's awesome. I hope to retire one day and go on vacations with my significant other.
833,Where would you like to travel?
833,"I want to go to Tokyo, what about yourself?"
833,My favorite place to visit is Hawaii because it is so beautiful and warm.
833,hawaii is gorgeous . i have to go someday when I have the funds.
833,There's lots to do there but it is kind of expensive so you really have to save up.
833,Yes I completely agree. Do you think you can travel there soon?
833,Hopefully soon.  It was nice talking to you.
834,Does Drake love Nicki Minaj?
834,"I believe he may. We know he doesn't love Madonna, huh? lol"
834,Do we? I did not know about this!
834,Did you not see the kiss between Madonna and Drake? His reaction was pure disgust!
834,"Wow, Drake is such a nice guy though!"
834,"Yes, he later said it was her lip gloss, not her. But, I think that was the nice guy talking!"
834,Well you know guys have there way with words!

835,That is literally my favorite airline. Awesome job dad. 
835,"For sure. They can't change it to JetPink, but JetBlue will work... for now. "

835,Now there's a concept. You will be making millions someday!
835,Not as fast as Jeff Bezos can monopolize the shipping market! :D
835,"Jeff also started out simple. That is the key, my friend."

838,Sometimes we will cook after class in the evenings. What is your favorite dish?
838,I love pasta of all kinds! What is yours?
838,I am a vegetarian so I prefer veggie sauces and ingredients.
838,I can understand that. Do you ever cook for your parents? I used to cook for mine all the time.
838,"Not very often, they do not live near me. "
838,"I can relate. About a month ago, they retired, then off to sunny Florida. I can't blame them. Do you enjoy the beaches there?"
838,"I sure do. A few times a week when I am done teaching, I will go to the beach. "
838,That's fun! Wished I was closer.

839,"Yep haha, they get huge, one of the biggest breeds of cats. I loved her so much."
839,I know what you mean. Somehow those little things (or not so little) sure do worm their way in.
839,"Yea she also ate a lot, I love cooking so I'd make her specially prepared tuna on her birthday."
839,"Aww! You're a sweet cat parent. I didn't even do that for my sister, and we're twins!"
839,"Oh you have a twin that's awesome, I do not have siblings which is why I love getting pets."
839,"Pets are better, anyway. Cats may lay on your sweaters, but at least they don't steal and then forget to wash them!"
839,"Haha that is a good point, she really was a sweetheart. I plan on getting a new one soon from the shelter."
839,"That's really nice of you! I've been thinking of adopting a shelter dog, but gah. Work! Too busy!"
839,"Yea that is the nice thing about cats, low maintenance so leaving them home during work is easy."
839,True! Until they start climbing your curtains and getting stuck up on doors. Mine does that sometimes.
839,Haha my mainecoon used to smack my blinds if I didn't feed her immediately.
840,They didn't have any vegetables except broccoli for sale! I can't stand broccoli!
840,Did you complain about it?
840,"No, I am a police officer and I didn't want to seem like I was abusing my power."
840,What did you to help the situation?
840,I asked the cashier nicely when other vegetables would be in stock! 
840,Did they corrct the mistake?
840,"sadly, no.  They will have a truck coming in later this week."
840,That is sad. what will you be eating until then?
840,"I was able to get canned green beans. Not what I prefer, but better than nothing."
840,Sure. Do you get time for hobbies?
840,Yes!  I like to dance on the weekends at the local bar.
840,Have you ever danced professionally? 
840,"No, but the kids at the grocery store are still being very loud. They are making me angry too!"

842,Oh yes! I don't play anything though. Do you?
842,I play guitar. I appreciate all artistic types!

844,"Okay, could have been better "

849,"It really feels good do be happy. Of course, you never know when the next crisis will come along."
849,True anxiety can be so bad but not worth thinking about.
849,"Yes, best to take each day as it comes. Do you meditate or do anything to keep yourself in the here and now?"
849,Meditation never did too much for me but CBD is great and just thinking I'm fine and rationalizing things helps.
849,"Yes, I am not all that Zen, either. So CBD works? Do you do the pills or the external cream?"
849,"CBD is usually in bud form or oil form, I smoke the bud sometimes but the oil vapes work best for me,"
849,Got it. I would be afraid to do the oil vape--have heard of people getting sick.
849,"Nah that's just bad weed cartridges from china, just get ones from official sources and you are fine, avoid knockoffs."

854,It's nice when the weather cooperates. I work at a small bakery and need some exercise!
854,Does it rain a lot where you live?
854,"It rains some, but mostly it gets very hot and humid in the summertime. "
854,It's very hot and humid where I live too. I prefer a colder climate.
854,So do I. Right now we are having perfect autumn weather and I love walking!
854,I spend a lot of time outdoors during the fall and winter.
854,What do you like to do outdoors in cool weather?
854,I love landscaping and making the property look nice.
854,"Oh, that's so rewarding.  I love doing that too, I just wish I had more time."
855,Yes but they still do not do it. It frustrated me.
855,How long has been acting this way?
855,four months now. 
855,I think you should move out or something
855,I am planning to move out by the end of this year.
855,Will you get another roommate?
855,I want to move back to my parents' house.
855,"Why not move into a new place, your place?"
855,"My mother is free now,she will be driving me to school."
855,Well that's cool I guess if it gets rid of your annoying roommate.
855,Sure. I also get to reduce on my bills.
855,Reducing bills? yeah all the way here. So you like listening to podcasts?
856,"We are still deciding on the location, have you been any place nice?"
856,"I went to Barbados once and loved it. I would recommend that, if you are looking for a vacation spot."
856,"Barbados sounds nice, we haven't gone on a vacation with just the two of us in years."
856,How long are you planning to get away?
856,We want to spend a week somewhere with a beach and good weather.
856,Plenty of options in the Caribbean!
856,"Yeah, I haven't been on a vacation like that in a long time and there are so many options."
856,I would go somewhere cold like Scotland. I don't like heat too much.
856,I would have to go to Scotland during the summer. I prefer the heat over cold.
856,I also want to see the Northern Lights. Another perk about being far north.
856,I saw the Northern Lights on a family vacation a long time ago. It is awesome. You definitely have to see it.
856,I would buy a special camera just for that occasion!
857,"Ha, I'm just kidding! I actually live in Grand Rapids myself."
857,"Really, yeah Western Mich is best, really like it here myself although me and Petey my dog have only been in the area 3 weeks :)"
857,"Oh, so you're new to the area. Welcome! My name is William, but I'm called Bill. "
857,"Hey Bill, I'm Jackie, Jackie O, I'm at the GR improve this weekend doing a few sets. U shud stop by! I'll buy you one."
857,"Oh nice, you're a musician then?"
857,"Nice, nice. I used to head bang with my BF all the time to GnR. Totally dig it. Welcome to the Jungle Bill baby!"
857,What instrument do you play?
857,Guitar. Actually was influenced by Slash believe it or not. Wear the top hat and everything when I play. Would like a GoGo's style band again.
857,"Oh wow, Guns-n-Roses and the GoGo's are pretty different bands! You like both?"
857,LOL yeah I like everything from Frankie Vali to Miley lol I like all styles for sure.
857,Do you sing as well?
857,I do. Me and Petey sometime set near the old Honda I drive and lay the hat out and make a couple bucks.
858,"Nah, I was about 20 minutes late due to traffic."
858,darn! it must be annoying staying that long in traffic
858,"Yeah, I wish there was a faster way to get home."
858,So true traffic is horrific! something needs to be done thats for sure
858,My daughter missed her dance class because of it.
858,"Wow, I wonder if it was an emergency how inconvenient it can be."
858,Luckily it wasn't anything urgent. I can't imagine how frustrating that would have been.
858,"Luckily yeah, so did you watch some youtube videos ?"
858,"I did with my daughter, I wanted to her still learn and practice so we watch some dance instruction videos."
859,I know. What do you do while he's working?
859,"I would watch the kids at home, tending to their needs"
859,That's great that you got to be with them during the day.
859,"Yeah, but it's honestly pretty tiring"
859,It seems like very hard work. I can see why it's tiring.
859,"Yep, I wish my husband was at home more"
859,We are the opposite. I work while my husband stays home with the kids.
859,"Really, how many children do you two have"
859,3
859,"What a handful, your husband is a hard worker"
859,He's a very hard worker. He runs a garden. That's what he does at home and the kids help him 
859,"That's great! More people should try gardening, it is quite a healthy hobby"
859,I agree. It's been healing for everyone I know.
860,I like to eat omelets the best. Over medium eggs are ok as well.
860,I like to have soft boiled eggs with my toast for breakfast.
860,"I ate them that way before I retired, but I no longer do."
860,"Sometimes, I over cook them, but I don't like them hard."
860,"I agree, hard boiled eggs do not taste good unless they are as deviled eggs."
860,"Before I stopped eating other dairy products, I used to put grated cheese in my omelettes."
860,"I never have. It is usually onions, peppers, and tomatoes on my omelets. "
860,"That sounds tasty too, maybe even I could cook that!"
860,It is really easy. I will meal prep for a couple of days and chop all the vegetables and seal them in Tupperware in the fridge.
860,I need to try that. I always need new recipes because without meat sometimes it is difficult to find good ones.
860,I use the internet to find different vegetarian recipes. 
860,"Yes, I do too. Sometimes though it includes ingredients that are hard to find in the regular supermarket."
861,"Yeah, I am thinking about going to see a movie tonight in the theater."
861,"That sounds like fun, what kind of movie will you see?"
861,I have no idea what is out right now. I usually like action or comedies. How about you?
861,"I like all kinds of movies. I have one of those unlimited movie subscriptions, so I see them all!"
861,That must be nice. The worst part for me is having to chose.
861,"Yeah, although with work I still have to choose because I don't have much free time!"
861,I hear that. I want to get out tonight as I will be pretty tired the rest of the week after work.
861,"I totally understand. Well, the best we can do is power through. I'm exhausted from work today and it's only Monday"
861,"Yeah, when you are working all you can think about is having time off. When you don't have a job all you can think about is looking for one."
861,"Yeah. A job is better than no job, I suppose. About time for me to go on Vacation though, I can't wait!"
861,"A vacation sounds nice, any place in particular that you plan to go to?"
861,"Yep, I'm going to Bonaire in the Carribbean for a week!"
862,That sound awesome. I hope you get to visit there someday.
862,where would you want to travel?
862,I really want to go to Scotland someday.
862,I haven't been to Scotland but I hear it has quite some scenery
862,"If I went there, I would want to stay for a long time. Maybe have a home there."
863,What's your favorite built?
863,"We are picking out stainless steel appliances, white cabinets and quartz countertops. It's so much fun to pick everything out!"
863,What about Aluminum appliances? More environmentally friendly.
863,"Exactly yes, landscape architecture is always changing. I like that people are using more sustainable materials now."
863,It is very important for future generations.
863,Yes. We need to teach the future generation about sustainability in schools so they can continue to improve our planet.
863,The only issues is decreasing prices and improving availability.
863,What about the decreasing prices? Isn't it a good thing?
863,"I mean that we need to decrease the prices, they are currently too high."
863,Oh I feel you! I have 2 kids and the prices of groceries and school supplies are insane.
863,"chool Supplies have less competition over the years with many companies out of business or being absorbed, only 1-3 brands on average are in a store"
863,That makes sense. Are you a teacher?
864,"I dont usually wear tennis shoes, I wear Skis"
864,Aren't skis difficult to walk in when in hallways?
864,"Yes i imagine they would be, however, im always on the slopes. Im a competitive ski racer so never have time for anything else ski"
864,What about boards? Why choose skis over boards? Takes up less space.
864,I broke my arm once using a board and havent used them since
864,"Ouch, how did that happen?"
864,"I want to say the climate and slopes just werent right that day but it was more like me not paying attention. Turned to quick, tumbled, and hit a tree"
864,So what do you do in the summer?
864,I have a vacation home in alaska. I usually travel there 
864,Heard there are a lot of bears there.
864,There can be but the scenery and mountains are beautiful
864,That is very true
865,That sounds amazing. I dont really do much dancing but I do love to go hiking
865,"The question is which is better, Sals or the Electric Slide?"
865,I wouldnt know for sure but I would have to go with the electric slide if i was to choose
865,Yeah seems like a more fun dance
865,I agree. I think it does seem more interesting and more fun to me 
865,"That's what's important, fun, not work."
865,"I always try to have fun, sometimes to much. Had alot of fun racing cars once, then i broke my arm. Not the hobby for me "
865,How did that happen?
865,"Just going to fast, car flipped. Luckily it was not worse so im thankful "
865,NO serious damage?
865,To the car yes but not to me. SImply a broken arm. GUess i had some angels watching that day 
865,good lucky
866,"I never could get into fallout, my favorite is Grand Theft Auto"
866,I love Grand Theft Auto too! I remember my first was Vice City
866,"Nice, yeah I think my first was GTA 3! What do you do for a living?"
866,I do private massages and reflexology too
866,"Nice, I wait tables at a restaurant"
866,Really? that is interesting how long have you been on the job?
866,"I've done it for almost 3 years so far while in college. It isn't too bad, especially if people tip well"
866,I do hope you get to keep the tips and not share it or something
866,"Yeah, most of my customers are regulars, so I'm happy. And I don't share any of my tips!"
866,I can see you are a humble person and I am happy for you!
866,Thanks for the kind words! Someone has to keep my cat fed and spoiled!
866,You do have a cat!?
867,"Yes, we are defiantly are."
867,How long have you and your wife been together?
867,We have been together for 10 years now.
867,Wow. That's a long time. Congrats!
867,Thank you. I am really happy to be married and having kids that is one of the best things that happened  to me so far.
867,That's great! I wish one day I can have kids as well.
867,Are you dating anybody right now?
867,Nope. Living the single life. Might just stick with family and friends for now.
867,Well that's sound good as well! Are you traveling? 
867,"Yeah, I love to travel! Although, I usually go for short stays but move a lot."
867,Have you been abroad. My wife is from Ukraine. So we are constantly traveling.
867,"No I have not, I always wanted to travel around there though."
868,Why's that
868,Because she is staying there for school
868,I see
868,It shouldn't be a problem
868,So whats the film
868,"I don't know, you wanted to film it"
868,I sent you a letter to choose the film
868,"Oh dear, I will get right on that!"
868,Make sure it puts on smile on peoples face
868,"Absolutely!  You don't have spiders, do you?"
868,No
868,"Good, because I am terrified of spiders."
869,That's pretty cool! Have you ever done it?
869,Yes I have. I found it to be very painful.
869,"Haha, oh no! I've been reading some blogs about it online and I'm scared"
869,oh . i know that can make you nervous . i would be scared .
869,"Yeah, I've been collaborating with some publishers online on getting my experience in print"
870,What was the name of the movie?
870,Star Wars of course. I quit college though
870,Why did you quite college?
870,My mom put too much pressure on me. It wasn't fun
870,"I agree it ain't that much fun, books that is "
870,i would have quit anyway. I don't want to be a music teacher like er
870,"Oh,you were studying music? I studied physics"
870,I studied music and psychology. Now I am a zumba instructor
870,Zumba is fantastic I tried it one time but it got too hard for me lol
870,I almost passed out the first time. You have to keep at it
870,Does it get better the longer you keep at it?
870,Its easier when you build up your stamina to dance for a long time
871,how many kids do you have?
871,I have 3. What about you?
871,I have three too. I'm trying to get them to become vegetarians like me
871,That really limits your dietary choices.  I don't recommend it. 
871,It's very healthy. I am still trying myself. I do love bacon though
871,"meat is amazing ,lol. bacon is my downfall ."
871,I know right!. I can eat it with anything
871,"Yeah, it's all my kids ever ask for. I've been trying to catch up on the show face off lately"
871,I've never seen it
871,Face Off is on the Syfy channel and is one of the best shows on TV!!
871,Is it better than game of thrones?
871,Oh yeah!! And the writing actually makes since vs. whatever the heck GoT was thinking with that last season
872,Wow. I just learned how to brew beer with my partner
872,"Dang that is so cool, have you tried it?"
872,We are still working out some kinks but it's going well
872,"Cool, sounds really fun."
872,What do you do?
872,These days I work for an accounting firm.
872,Sounds... fun? What do you do in your down time?
872,I coach a highschool football team actually.
872,In your down time? wow
872,"Yea I love football so it is actually quite nice, takes a lot of my time but it's what I enjoy and I get paid."
872,Does your team win a lot?
872,They aren't bad probably top 3 in state but nationally not great.
873,You seem to know a lot. I only have one tattoo
873,"Thats awesome i used to do the tattoos and recently purchased 2 tatoo machines a shader and a liner , been drawing since i was 5 years old"
873,That's cool. I have a rose on my ankle. Might get more
873,I like roses! Do they mean anything?
873,I just thought it was cute. Can't get many since I work at a doctors office
873,I understand. I am like that with my tattoos - i have to cover them up too.
873,"I won't work there forever, but I might be too old when I leave lol"
873,Nah. You're only as old as you feel.
873,That is so true.
873,"Sometimes I feel young at heart even though my body says ""no, you're old."
873,HAHA! I still like to think I can keep up though
873,Sometimes I feel like I can.... and then my back starts aching.
874,Blue. I buy something blue every time I go to the mall
874,"Great choice of color, I personally like green"
874,What is your job?
874,"I'm currently unemployed, job market has not been great"
874,I know how you feel. I was once unemployed for two whole years
874,"Wow, how did you get by during that time. "
874,My husband is great. I spent more time with the kids and he was superman
874,How so was he superman?
874,"He made sure we stayed afloat, and we still went on nice vacations. "
874,"That's really nice, he really did become your family's superman"
874,He did. He is the best
874,I wish one day I can have a S.O
875,It was decent but it doesn't fit.
875,Can you exchange it?
875,"No, it's an accessory to an instrument so they won't let you return on separate piece or exchange."
875,"Oh, well you can always donate or regift."
875,"I suppose, but then they will be expecting to see me with it at dinner this upcoming special holiday"
875,I thought you didn't know who sent it?
875,There was a letter in the box
875,"Oh, well when you see them let them know it is the wrong size."
875,One thing about strangers is you don't know how they will react
875,"Very true, but you can't help that it doesn't fit."
875,"Yeah thats true, things happen"
875,"Yes, and if they ask just politely explain as best as you can."
876,My hobbies include swimming in the lake. I love seeing all the turtles poking their heads out.
876,"Ha, those turtles!  Interesting they are all named after Renaissance artists yet live in the sewers"
876,"To be clear, I don't like the sewer turtles! only the lake ones. I also have two at home. Do you have any pets?"
876,"Ha, that is understandable. What do you usually do on the lake? Yes! I have a dog i love very much"
876,"Wading in the water is enough for me, but sometimes I swim laps. I have a dog too! he has a red collar. She doesn't like the turtles though!"
876,"That sounds fun, you never go fishing on the lake? I can imagine she doesn't like the turtles all too much!"
876,"Fishing is not my forte, but I assume it's yours?"
876,"Definitely, I love fishing.. ever since my dad taught me when I was little, I still love to"
876,I never learned really until I taught myself a couple of years ago. Never got the jist of it though. I hope you and your dog have a great life.
876,"Thank you, and same to you! I hope you enjoy many happy swimming days with your little princess."
876,"Indeed I will, though she likes to sit on the shore and wait for me to come out unless she can stand in the water, haha."
876,"Oh, no.. she's not much of a swimmer? My dog cannot get enough of the water."
876,"Not typically. My girlfriends dog is definitely more of a swimmer, maybe more than I am. Mine's just lazy!"
877,I hope so to!!!!!
877,What language course was it?
877,It was in Advanced English 4. It wasn't that hard but some of it was tough 
877,I'm currently taking Advanced English 5 and it's significantly harder
877,oh i bet. Im not looking forward to moving to that class next
877,"As of now, only Ms.But teaches this course. She makes it so much harder"
877,"I dont like when only one teacher teaches the course. It does make it harder, espeically if you do not share thier teaching style"
877,"Yeah, really makes me want to drop out and do something that doesn't require a degree. "
877,i have been thinking that as well
877,"My family doesn't support my decisions too, and get this. I"
877,Mine do not either. THey think the degree is the right thing to do
877,"Yep, hopefully you and me both do well in our courses and get this school overwith"
878,The issue is that with todays biases it's harder to connect with one through reading these days as before.
878,"Thats very true. As they say there are no right or wrong ways to reading, just flow along and interpret the way you understand"
878,You like any genres of books?
878,"Oh, absolutely. I love sci-fi and fantasy. Really enjoyed reading Ender's Game recently."
878,Im a fan of crime novels myself.
878,"That's awesome, I actually follow a few forums about true crime but I haven't read a lot of crime books. Any suggestions?"
878,"Yes, many books by the famous Benito Mussolini or Dylan Roof"
878,Anything a little less . . . mass-murder-y?
878,"I meant to say James Patterson, he writes about those subjects, he also rights about less serious subjects, like detectives"
878,"Ahhh, I gotchya. I should definitely check him out. What else do you like to do with your time besides reading?"
878,Well sometimes I loke to
878,Hit enter too soon? Happens to the best of us. Do go on. :)
879,"Ford is the only company to not need government loans after the financial crash, they know how to make cars and adapt"
879,"Yeah, I swear by Ford cars until the day I die"
879,"Toyota sales are going down, they were the cheap toy car, hence the name, but people are getting mad at the prices on maintenance."
879,"Toy-ota are for people who don't understand what a good car brand is. Unlike me, who owns a ford truck."
879,"Yes, and it had goos gas milage, so don't need to stop by the pump so much"
879,"Yes they do, however I got the twin turbo, supercharged, V12, fully loaded Truck. So the gas milage isn't so good"
879,"Yes, but the built quality makes up for it as well as performance."
879,"Absolutely, I take my Ford truck to the drag strip all the time. Quite the performance under the hatch"
879,It's crazy how much better a pickup can be compared to a sedan
879,"Yes, and even compared to sports car. Pickups are the jack of all trades, I don't know if I can sleep at night without owning one"
879,"Only thing it needs is room for a microwave, small bed, and shower to be better than an RV."
879,"Yep, honestly showers are luxury and bathroom can also be a bottle, I would take my pickup over an RV any day."
880,I know right! I was going to go to the park like I usually do.
880,well the park is close by . we could meet there hehe 
880,That sounds great I'm trying to meet new people since I don't a lot of friends here. :(
880,"Well I'll see you there, ill be wearing red shoes and drive up in a red car. "
880,Seems like you like red a lot huh! Well alright I'll meet you there :) I'll be in a black dress~
880,Yea I like red 
880,That's pretty cool! I like red too but I think green's probably my favorite color 
880,Nice! I never asked you what your favorite color is
880,Aw why are you being mean now you were so nice before :(
880,I just clicked the example bro
880,Alright let's just go back to talking about the park. What do you like doing there?
880,"Hmm, I like to play on the playground, but only if its red "
881,Do you ever do volunteer work?
881,"I do, I have a few things I do - the local food bank, and I teach a free art class for kids twice a month. You?"
881,I help with a local food co-op and a community garden
881,That's awesome! I grew up rural so I love that sort of thing. How long have you been doing that?
881,I've been doing it about 5 years now.
881,Very cool. :) Such a great option for people who don't have time or space to have a big garden. 
881,I love healthy living and highly recommend it
881,Do you spend a lot of time outdoors in general? I love hiking and being out in nature.
881,I do. I find that it is very therapeutic
881,Absolutely. I'm an artist so I like to get a lot of inspiration from the natural world.
881,What kind of art do you make?
881,"Well, I love comics and comic art but it's not my forte. I like drawing - pencil or pen"
882,Not a whole lot just sat at home. What about you?
882,I love being outside in the fun and the fresh air.
882,"Wow, think we are opposites! I think I rarely left my couch today."
882,Don't get me wrong I love sitting on the couch. But what happens when your power goes out?
882,The times it has I just took a nap lol
882,"Oh wow, I love couch naps. I don't get that opportunity very often"
882,Me too! lol Why not? You seem like a busy person.
882,Sure am. I have a six month old and work full time
882,Oh wow!! Busy busy! It's always just me alone with my tv and couch.
882,Have you thought of getting a pet?
882,"Thought about it, But I just want to make sure I will take care of it honestly."
882,Yea pets are definitely work but well worth the company
883,The Hippopotamus sure are large animals. They also tend to be found in Africa.
883,Wow I did not know that! Hippos are huge!
883,Yep they also tend to like places where there is a lot of mud and is humid.
883,please do not make fun of the way i say hippopotamus when we do! I like everything about them!
883,"They are good animals though, they have excellent quanitites."
883,They really are! I like how big and massive they are. 
883,"I don't know how much they weight or how big they are, but they sure are fantastic!"
883,They are really cool looking animals! They could eat me whole probably!
883,They probably can honestly.
883,They mostly eat plants or bamboo though. I think they would eat humans too!
883,Hope their environment is good enough for them.
883,They mostly eat plants or bamboo though. They probably have got fertilizer too lol.
884,"I love pizza, I just ate some last night and tonight. Canadian Bacon is the best!"
884,I have a doberman dog. 
884,Those are some cool dogs! what is the name of your dog?
884,His name is Knox. What about your dog?
884,Awwww my dog's name is Rocky. He likes pizza too!
884,Haha! Hey animals know whats good. So does pineapple go on pizza or not?
884,"I was never a believer, but my favorite pizza includes pineapple and I am an advocate for it! what do you think?"
884,"Pineapple all the way! I don't know why it works, but it does. "
884,"For sure, something about that explosive taste when cooked and mixed with everything"

918,Wow you lived on a farm. Yikes!. I couldn't do it. 
918,yeah it took a ton of work with school but so worth it
918,I believe it cause it teaches you values. I keep that mind set with my clients
918,that is true whats your job 
918,I work in a hospital 
918,That pretty interesting 
918,Where do you work at?

919,"Yeah, i can understand that. I take a lot of medication myself."
919,Beyond alcohol?
920,"yeah, i am a truck driver now"
920,"What's better, the money or the time away from family?"
920,"getting to see the country is the best.  i grew up in virgina, but has seem a lot of the USA now"
920,"living here makes everyone think i'm a loser , driving a truck would help me get away"
920,where are you from?
920,"I'm from California, I live in Compton"
920,Cali is a crazy place.  Driving truck would be good to get out and see other parts of the country
920,"I honestly would love to do that; I haven't seen my parents in years, my therapist is unhelpful - I just want to get away at this point"
920,"i don't blame you.  california has been on the news a lot, and not for anything good. you should do it"
920,"Yes, it seems like another person is murdered every day especially in Compton. How do I go about obtaining my license for it?"
920,Find a school to get your CDL.  You can usually get it done in a few weeks.
920,"Oh wow, it's that quick, never would have guessed. Thanks for the help, I'm going to go change my life now"
920,great to hear!  best of luck to you!!
920,You too! Thanks!

921,"Yeah, I hate getting stuck in traffic."
921,"Luckily my new job requires me to work online, so i can mostly work from home."
922,It is a bad thing to vote this way.
922,have you decided who to vote for ?
922,No.  What is your nickname?
922, angela . how about yours?
922,It is bubblegum.
922,LOL! I love it! What a cute name. Can you tell me a little more about yourself?

923,Nice. I have a civic myself a 2004

923,Colorado is a beatiful place to live. How long you lived there for? 
923,1 year after i got my mba from the universtiy of colorado
923,That's nice. I been thinking about going to school. I work at a retail store?
923,for what may i ask
923,I work at a local retail store nothing major. They sell sports gear nothing special
923,hey its at least a job 
923,Yes it pays the bills and keeps my civic running. Where do you work at?
923,i run my own dog treat company 
923,Oh thats cool. How many dogs do you own
923,me and my wife have 4
924,Thats cool. My father was a preacher
924,That's great. The community aspect of church is fun.
924,Yes it is. Too bad I stopped going since I been working on Sundays
924,I see. Seventh-Day Adventist and other sabbatarians hold their schools on Saturdays.
924,I know. But my father want's me to go to his church on Sundays since he preaches
924,Why does he do that? Jesus never do that as the the central figure of Christianity.
924,I know but he likes to think he's in charge when it comes to god. I have no conrol over that
924,my father preaches on sundays . he says the city is full of sin . . . is it ?
924,"Has to be, since majority of the people go to church. Everybody sins at the end of the day"
924,Sin is so subjective 
924,Yes it is but it happens daily and no sin is greater than the other
924,That is so true. I agree with you
925,"Sadly, no. I looked like a buffoon. "
925,Oh no that no good! better luck next time
925,Do you ever have to give speeches at work?
925,Well Im  teacher so I give lectures all the time!
925,No way! Do you have any tips on how to not be such an idiot?
925,"Memorize the content and make tiny notes, always keep your eyes trained on the audience as much as possible and be confident"
925,Dude that's the thing. I'm incredibly confident. I just couldn't figure out what to do. 
925,Did you practice beforehand?
925,Of course I did!
925,"Hmm , thats a tough one then do you get nervous when up in front of a crowd?"
925,My work doesn't really put me in front of a lot of crowds....
925,"that true, It would make for awesome practice though I guess"
926,Even i like to travel and learn about new cultures especially their food.
926,Food is the gateway to life.
926,"That's so true, human life starts and ends with a party."
927,"I never knew that. I also like to sing in the shower, I am a musician."
927,What kind of music do you like to sing? My favourite is pop.
927,I usually sing the songs I wrote in the shower. They are a mix of the blues and Country music.
927,How long have you been writing/singing Blues and Country music for?
927,I have been writing music for about 22 years. Do you have any hobbies?
927,"Yes, I enjoy working out - mostly running outside."
927,"Nice, it's good to hear. I use to like to go hiking in my younger days. It is very rewarding."
927,Hiking is a great way to get active. How come you don't hike anymore?
927,After my back surgery I was unable to go back to work. It hard to move around sometimes but I manage.
927,Oh no thats unfortunate. Did you have a rough recovery?
927,"No, the recovery was fine. The surgery was ineffective on alleviating the pain. "
927,What type of pain do you experience?
927,It's like a pain when someone hits your funny bone and it really stings.
928,That is interesting.  I've never used a lawyer before because trusting people is hard for me.
928,You don't have to trust people but trust yourself to make the right decision.
928,That's a great point.  I need to start respecting myself more.  Do you have any tips for self confidence?
928,Just fake it until you feel confident.
928,That's a theory that I can see working out.  Maybe that will help me out with not liking to be alone.
928,"It is important that you be alone so, you can like yourself."
928,"I appreciate your honestly and feedback.  Thanks for being a good friend.  Being alone sometimes isn't so bad, right?"
928,It is a good thing.  You learn your likes and dislike when you are alone.
928,Those things are important to know.  That way I can give my best to each person that I meet.  Are you a confident person?
928,I have to fake it sometimes.  It is definitely a process.
928,Seems like a process that I should start sooner rather than later.  I feel confident about changing my attitude - thanks for helping me see that.
928,You are welcome. You will get there.
929,"Yes, that is correct! I started out when I was 8 and love it!!!"
929,"I love it too, it's the only alternative to ice skating when it's hot out"
929,WE have a local roller/ice skating rink that is indoors so you can skate pretty much all year. really keeps me in shape.
929,"that is awesome, all in one place makes it easy. I like to relax sometimes, like when my mommy makes me lunch and we have a picnic"
929,"Yes,I love a picnic. So your mommy makes a picnic?"
929,"yes she does, and then when we're done, my daddy brings home flowers for me"
929,Does you mommy and daddy know that you are playing on a computer? You should probably go get your mommy and show them what you are typing
929,"It's okay, they're watching over me right now, but mommy thinks I should be spending my time studying for the LSAT. I disagree"
929,I agree with your mom. The internet is not a place for children to play 
929,"I agree with the second sentence, but the fact of the matter is I'm 25 and struggle with alcoholism"
929,"Well,I can relate. Addiction is a hard thing to handle, but there are a lot of places that can help"
929,"It's a terrible addiction, but despite my efforts in quitting, I just can't seem to stop"
930,I'm a chef at an Italian restaurant 
930,Lucky! I wish I could be a chef!
930,its tough work not to eat everything 
930,Haha! I can imagine. Everything must be so delicious!
930,that why sometimes i go to yoga classes when i can find the time
930,Yoga seems like a good way to get your body in shape. Has it been working well for you?

932,My son struggles a lot with acne. Are there any tips you can give him?

933,"Sorry to hear that, I`m sure there`s a way to get care for your cat. What`s your plans for employment?"
933,My favorite food is pizza
933,Pizza is awesome! We should try a breakfast pizza.
934,Really!? Never knew it was the old.
934,yes it was a great show the one today is good but the original was better
934,Can you compare it to anything recent?
934,there is nothing on tv that compares today
934,Just like I thought.
934,yes everything is dull in comparison these days
934,Not too loud...don't let the younger generation hear you.
934,They tell me that too I get too excited about kitten videos
934,If only they know how life used to be.
934,agreed but this is the way the world is now we have to accept it
934,I agree completely.
934,agreed just have to live life and eat some brownies

936,I regret that I went to college in Maryland.
936,That's interesting that you lived there.  That is where my husband is originally from.  We have 4 kids and 2 pets.
936,Did you play sports in college?

936,"I played basketball. Now, I am a professional basketball players."

940,"its hard, so I have been picking up odd jobs here and there and getting by."
940,dang that sounds really frustrating. what about in your free time do you do anything fun that could take your mind off things? me personally i like to draw
940,"That's a great hobby. I like to do gardening, its fun! Have you made any cool drawings lately?"
940,"Oooh that's really cool, sounds peaceful :-) Hm, and not so much lately mostly I've just been taking care of my 3 younger siblings"
940,"aww, that's nice.  How old are your siblings?"
940,"2 yrs and 11 yrs (twins lol). They're a hassle but what can you do? Family, yknow. "
940,"I agree. The twins are old enough to go to school, but the 2 yr old probably needs more looking after, isn't it?"
940,Oh yes definitely. You know little kids in their terrible twos just love to make a mess of everything hahaha
940,"hahaha true, and they ask so many questions! It could be fun at times, but surely a lot of work!"
940,I know right! Do you have any younger siblings too? 
940,I do have a younger sibling but I live by myself now so I don't have to look after him anymore ! lol
941,"Yes, he talks to her like everyday and seeks her advice."
941,But her personality is even-tempered and charming most of the time?
941,"No, I think she's flirting with him some of the time. I really don't like her"
941,Yeah I can see why that would bother you. I'm sorry to hear that.
941,I mean I
941,Maybe he needs to break away from her a bit. Maybe then she will mind her own business.
941,"I agree. I meant to say I'm a yoga instructor, so I should probably take some of my classes to relax.."
941,"Good thinking, yoga is a great way to relax! Is music ever played during a yoga session?"
941,We do both! We have quiet sessions and then more louder sessions that are also for fun and not as serious
941,"Interesting, that sounds like fun! Do you think there's a specific music that enables you to loosen up more? I'm thinking the louder sessions would feature rock music.  "
941,"I personally think pop music and EDM type music gets people going the most. Most of the people are younger anyway, so they know the songs"
941,I am more like a rock and roll type of guy myself but I can see how pop music and EDM is more attractive to the younger crowd.
942,"oh,intersting.i know that"
942,You must know a lot about music. What is your favorite genre? 
942,"Yes,i know must lot of music,The piano like that"

942,That is find the hunters is some days
942,Do you know of any hunting spots in your area that are fun to visit?
943,The old man and the sea??  What is that?  Is that a new skateboarding trick that I've been hearing about?
943,"Yes, it involves aging to seventy and then rocketing up the half-pipe wall like a wave, during a severe thunderstorm"
943,Dude - I'm so going to try that when I get that old!  I hope that skateboarding continues to a hobby for that long.  Do you skate?
943,Only when the weather is below zero on frozen rinks
943,Ahh I wish that I had skills on the ice but only on wheels myself.  Do you ever play hockey?
943,"I used to, but then I tore my ACL, sustained a concussion, and busted my shoulder all in my OHL draft eligibility year - never played after that"
943,That sounds painful!  What do you do with all of your free time now?
943,"I mostly play video games, a lot of Call of Duty these days"
943,"I love video games too.  When I'm playing them, I love to eat Mike n Ike's.  What is your favorite candy?"
943,"Oh, I actually don't eat sweets all that often, but when I do, Lindt's or Ferraro Rocher chocolates"
943,Great choices.  When it comes to COD - do you play on PS4 or XB1?

944,They are really cool looking animals!
944,Did you know that Zebra stripes is like human fingerprint. Each one is unique.
944,"I did not know that, but thank you for sharing that with me!"
944,There are only 3 species of Zebra and they are found in Africa
944,There are also plains zebras. They are common in game reserves but are threatened by human hunting.
944,"Yes, i don't understand why would someone want to kill such a beautiful animal for fun."
944,I don't either! They would have to be something very wrong as I couldn't imagine hurting an innocent!
944,Last year I had gone to Africa with my boyfriend and got to see them in the wild. They are magnificent animals. 
944,That's so awesome. I'd love to travel there someday!
944,The Masai Mara in Kenya is the best place to see them up close
944,I just Googled it. It does seem beautiful online. Maybe that could be next year's trip!
945,I'm 18 and getting preparing for college. I haven't decided on a major yet.
945,My mom wants me to go to a local college and live at home. 
945,That's a good plan to save money instead of paying rent for a dorm room.
945,She's a stay-at-home mom though so I want to be alone sometimes
945,I understand the feeling of wanting to be alone. You will have more privacy in a dorm room.
945,Are you going to live in a dorm
945,I'm going to live in a all male dormitory and a single room. 
945,Are your parents going to pay for your tuition
945,"No, I have scholarships to cover my tuition and most of my dorm's cost."
945,You must be very smart
945,"Yes, but I also applied for many scholarships and earned enough to pay for most expenses."
945,I don't like to work so I don't know what to do
946,Hubby was the one that got me into sushi.  We try to go to a good sushi joint once a week.
946,Where are you from.  We dont really have alot of good Sushi spots around here.  Usually have to drive into the City to get good Sushi.
946,"We're close to Hattiesburg, MS.  The drive there only takes about 15 minutes.  "
946,Ok cool.  We drive through there on our way to Florida every summer.  We are from Texas.
946,I'm originally from Florida - hubby and I grew up in Tampa.  
946,I have some family from Florida as well.  We usually go to Seaside every summer.  Great place. 
946,"That's the nice thing about travelling, you're always going to find good food no matter where you go."
946,That is true.  Are you getting any bad weather in MS?  We had some Tornadoes come through last night and a storm was headed your way.
946,"It rained most of the day but by the time the sun went down, it was clearing up.  Were you near the tornadoes in Dallas?"
946,Yes.  We are just east of Dallas.  Actually had one touch down about 1/4 mile from my house.  Minor damage in a close neighborhood.  Got lucky!
946,Wow.  I saw on the news about the damage done there and it looked bad!

947,Oh wow that's a while! And probably in a year or two!
948,Do you have a job at the moment? I just got one at Mcdonalds. 
948,"Yes, I work for Del Taco"
948,How do you like working there?

949,"oh, i am an ovo lacto vegetarian, so it will be beans, sour cream and cheese."
949,"Oh nice, I can respect that. I only plan on turkey due to me being advised not to eat a whole lot. "
949,"oh that;s sad, turkey was my favorite before i turned vegetarian. But i dont miss it now."
950,"No, I live on the west coast. What about you?"
950,I also live in the west coast!
950,I work on semi trucks for a living so I travel a lot
950,"I've never driven a truck, only small vehicles! How's that working out for you?"
950,My dad was a driver so I learned a lot about trucks growing up. What do you do for a living?
950,I work as a bartender in my town.
950,do you get a lot of tips?
950,Yes I do! I think it has something to do with my looks LOL.
950,You're probably a lot prettier than a lumber jack like me!
950,Haha thanks! I'm sure you are good looking as well though.
950,My dog Skipper thinks I'm the handsomest in the world
950,That is so funny! What kind of dog do you have?
951,"Nope, she turned out to be fine. The doctor wasn't too happy"
951,That's good to hear. Why was the doctor unhappy about it?
952,"No, but I think it was my mom getting some water in the kitchen. "
952,Great. Currently I am pursuing my music industry degree. I am a student living at home. 
952,"Wow, that's so cool! I give guitar lessons!"
952,Really? I used to give piano lessons. My mother works in telecommunications. What about your mom?
952,"My mom is a software engineer, but she signed me up for the guitar when I was little."
952,Nice! My dad wanted me to learn piano when I was 4 that's why I learned. What's your favorite thing to do?
952,I like to visit different places.
952,where is the best place you have visited ?
952,I went to paris this summer!
952,Did you go to Disneyland Paris?
953,What do you do for work?
953,I am a bartender at the moment.
953,Do you like your job
953,I enjoy it but like most jobs it does have its bad days.
953,That's true. I want to surf more often but I work full-time so I have no time
953,There's more stuff to do than the beach though!
953,What do you have in mind?
953,Maybe a concert or something!
953,That's true. I really like listening to Jason mraz
953,I went to his concert last year! He is great!
953,I'm such a huge fan. You're really lucky!
953,I know right? Do you like beer?
954,"oooh that sounds really fun! me, I love to relax with a nice glass of red wine. It's my favorite drink! what's yours?"
954,red wine is my favorite especially .
954,I know right! White wine is way too sweet for me
954,"its the only think my father will drink,  since my birth."
954,Oh? He doesn't like beer?
954,"Yeah, he drinks beer sometimes"
954,Can't say it's my favorite but growing up my dad and grandpa drank a lot of heineken haha so i indulge once in a while 
954,Yes I enjoy a beer too from time to time.
954,Yeah my son prefers it over wine so if we're kicking back that's what we're drinking for the night! Do you have any kids?
954,Yes I have a couple. 
954,How old are they? :o

955,You're so lucky! I would have loved to move around when I was younger. I'm a social butterfly. Do you make a lot of friends when surfing?
955,Not really :( i'm kind of a loner. You're the lucky one! I wish i could talk to people more openly
955,I used to have a hard time making buddies.  Now it comes naturally.  I'd suggest just putting yourself out there and trying!
955,"True, true I guess that takes practice just like most things :o"
955,So true.  Lots and lots of practice.  I know that you can do it though.  You're strong and determined!
955,;-; Thank you so much! You're really kind!
955,I got your back and support you anytime.  Being positive is something that I try and do and help others be.
955,That's really inspirational~ I want to be more like that!
955,Thank you so much for listening to me.  You're a good listener and I hope that you have a great day and night!

957,Awesome. I don't think I could handle that job.
957,What do you like doing
958,I like to be alone at time. It makes me relax
958,I know right! So soothing to have some downtime. Sometimes I escape to my vacation home in the mountains hehe
958,That sounds amazing. But I'm too scared to go to the mountains. I don't like trying new things.
958,Aww why are you scared! Trying new things is so fun and who knows u might love it !
958,I feel more comfortable doing things I'm familiar with and I'm satisfied with it
958,"Ah, I see! I feel like people like that are more reliable :o very steadfast, yknow?"
958,You could say reliable but also boring to some people. What are your hobbies?

961,oh yes me to I use to hate it when I was a kid
961,Saaaame! I feel like kids are just so picky lol 
962,Now I'm looking for someone to be my hiking buddy every weekend because that is something that I really enjoy doing.
962,That sounds nice. Where do you like hiking?
962,There is a very long windy trail not too far away
962,"How long do you usually hike? To be honest, I've only been hiking once."
962,e hike about an hour to two every time. We discuss a bunch of different things like our favorite color. My favorite color is red.
962,That's my favorite color too! I go overboard with it a bit...everything I own is red :)
962,"Yea, that's pretty cool! I own red hiking boots too."
962,"Nice! I've heard people say it's an ""angry"" color, but I don't think that at all. What are some of your other favorites?"
962,Oh I have many other favorites. I like red orange as well.
962,"Well, it's the perfect season for that color! To me fall is all about reds and oranges. I usually eat more things with those colors around this time too."
962,What do you like to eat around this time of the season
962,"Apples. They're my favorite fruit anyway, but Macintosh apples are in season where I am so that's what I have the most of."
963,I work as an accountant in a private company
963,That sounds like a pretty cool gig.  Did you go to school for that?
963,I have a masters in accountancy beside I have many courses
963,Sounds like you know a lot of cool facts and stuff.  That's pretty interesting.  What is your favorite number?
963,my favorite number is 7. It looks really perfect for me. what's your's?
963,That's a good number.  Many people consider that lucky.  I think that I'd go with 5.  Do you have any tattoos?
963,"No, I never dared to have one. what about you?"
963,I have none.  I wish that I had gotten one but people in my day thought they were not civil.  I enjoy tats!
963,I like listening to music in my spare time. what do you like doing?
963,Music is great - I love rock and roll.  I also like watching TV.  Glee is my favorite.  What is your favorite show?
963,I like vampires based shows like originals and vampire diaries. besides I also like game of thrones and other trending shows.
963,Very cool.  I like Vampire Diaries too.  Never seen GOT though.  Would you recommend it?
963,"of course, it's an interesting show to watch...! I also like detective shows they always keep me interested. "
964,I'll probably get a gift for my son
964,"thats awesome, what would you get him?"
964,Maybe just a gift card. He likes video games 
964,Haha sometimes i like getting gift cards but sometimes I feel like a gift is more..... personal
964,That's true. I'll get him something more personal for Christmas
964,"Cant wait for christmas myself, i just hope i have enough money for gifts for everyone"
964,Christmas is really expensive. Do you have to work during Christmas?
964,"Not with the job I have but when i was younger working partime, sometimes. Which was very sad "
964,That's really too bad. I'm glad you don't have to work during christmas now
964,"Same here, how about you? work during christmas?"
964,"Yes, unfortunately. My mom will take care of my son during Christams"
964,"Oh no, that sounds terrible! I hope they compensate you for it"
965,That's pretty cool. Have you ever been to Japan?
965,this is my first time
965,"Nice, are you traveling for work or vacation?"
965,a little bit of both
965,Are you by yourself or with family?
965,with family and our cat too!
965,"Nice! I have three kids, so taking them anywhere basically triples the price since we have to get 2 hotel rooms"
965,ouch! that's a bummer. we're looking for a new house here
965,Interesting. I've heard that homes are really different than in the US. Like they are super close together
965,"yeah they are ""compact"" but we like the simplicity of things we can also use more of nature resources for food etc."
965,"Yeah I guess that makes since. I personally want my own lot, without sharing any walls with people. Whatever floats your boat!"
965,hehe... in any specific location?
966,Ugh. And now I'm finding out in all this new research that peanut allergies MAY have been avoided!
966,Really I hadn't heard that before.
966,"I haven't read much about it. But mostly if you expose your kids early, blah blah blah"
966,That makes sense. But kind of scary what if the baby gets really sick.
966,"I think the idea is that if they get sick once, you slowly introduce them to the product. I'm no scientist, but it makes sense."
966,That does makes sense. Well better than having a very serious attach later one right.
966,Huh?
966,A serious allergy attack when your older.
966,Honestly I don’t know the science. But I *have* been on a plane where they told me not to open any peanut stuff because of some rando
966,I see. I am glad am not allergic to anything it would be awful. 
966,Oh come on. You're not even allergic to poison ivy?
966,No more than everybody and it is a good especially considering how much time I spend outdoors. 
967,"Thanks, I think that having a positive attitude and grinding hard will help!"
967,yes being positive will help you if you think good you do good
967,Only if the work is put in though.. The universe will Humble you without doing the work
967,you right my niece just said to me she don't do to much partying she be so tired after syuding
967,"That's for sure, Your niece sounds like a smart person. Im excited to get this exam done tomorrow though"
967,What class is it for? Whats your major
967,"Finance, I am majoring in Business."
967,Oh thats cool . I know you are going to do great !!!!
967,Thank you for the kind words. I am looking forward to camping out this weekend
967,yes some relaxation . I love traveling . I go overseas love venturing out 
967,"Well, I just bought a camper (First time) so this is completely new to me."
967,enjoy yourself. I use to be in girl scout  I loved going  camping
967,"Oh I will, I also exercise 4 times per week in various ways such as running or lifting weights. "
967,u are very active nice talking to you
967,Thank You I hope you have a nice night
968,i love it. we get to play outside a lot
968,Its always a good idea to enjoy the outdoors. So have fun!
968,what do you do?
968,"I mow lawns for a living, and it is so hot."
968,it is not fun to be outside in the heat for too long
968,That's true. Are you taking music lessons at school? My mother taught music at school.
968,"We do get to play music, and instruments. My mom teaches at my school."
968,"Music education is very important for young children, I think."
968,It is a lot of fun at preschool.
968,"What does your dad do for work? My dad is retired now, but he was a preacher."
968,My dad works at a warehouse. He works outside in the heat too sometimes
968,He must have good motor skills.
969,California is nice. It has perfect weather for exercising.
969,"It definitely does, it's one of the most beautiful places in the world and there seems to be shortage of activities to enjoy in general"
969,What kind of activities do you like?
969,"Well, I really enjoy music festivals, especially when my favourite band ""The Story So Far"" is involved"
969,"I like music too. What sort of music does ""The Story So Far"" play?"
969,They're a band classified in the nu-metal rock genre
969,I like rock music for when I am practicing. It helps get my heart rate up for sports.
969,"Yeah, rock is great for pump-up vibes. What sports do you play?"
969,"Football, mostly. I like how physical it is."
969,"Football is really fun to play and watch, I enjoy it as well. Not my favourite sport though, but my hometown doesn't have an NFL team"
969,"Yeah, it's always more fun when you have a home crowd. What is your favorite sport?"
969,Hockey - it's the first sport I picked up. I'm a Leafs fan through and through
970,You are so lucky. I would love to be able to do that. 
970,I agree. I am perfectly content with having to ride a bike at the moment.
970,So what else do you like to do?
970,Riding bikes all over the county.
970,Do you also race professionally or just for fun?
970,I love to race for professional
970,It looks so dangerous but like so much fun.
970,"Yes it is, before they were trained for racing, they were trained for warfare."
970,"Really, I never heard that. That is so cool."
970,Yes I love combat sports.
970,"I am not that good at that, but I bet I can beat you at pool."
970,I love beating others.
971,indeed. but they can also drive you crazy.
971,That is definitely true.  I need to drink coffee all day every day just to keep up.  How many kids do you have?
971,"just one. please don't get me wrong, I love him so much I am just ranting as usual in my age."
971,Make sure to cherish your moments with him.  Time goes so fast!  How old is he now?
971,"he is in his in his late 20's. as I said before, he was here recently and it was great!"
971,"He may be 29 but I'm still not so much a kid person.  If he's your kid, I'll make an exception.  What flavor coffee do you enjoy?"
971,I'm not a coffee person but I do love animals
971,Animals really are wonderful.  I think everyone should own pets.  How many do you have?
971,"I currently have a cat, do you have any animals?"
971,My cat's name is Venus.  I rescued her from a dog.  What is your cat's name?
971,"Kitty. OK, I know not very original but it was the first name I called and she turned her head so I just kept it"
971,That name is so fitting!  You should keep it - I love it.  I wonder if cat's love chocolate as much as humans do?
971,I think more than humans.
972,That might be a good idea. I like technology so I should probably look online too
972,Everybody is online nowadays. 
972,I think there are a lot of liars though. I only date people taller than me and I think people might lie about their height
972,"I mean, imagine me out there. I just lost my job. How do you convey *that* to a woman??"
972,"Oh, that's a delicate subject. But if someone doesn't like you because of your employment status then they're probably not the right person"
972,Oh c'mon now. You know that BS as much as I do
972,"Ok fine, maybe that's BS. Well you can get back on your feet and get back into the dating game"
972,How? I'm pathetic!
972,Having a part time job is better than no job! There's nothing wrong with starting from the ground
972,"Where are you getting ""part time job"" from? I said I lost my job; I'm out in the cold."
972,"If you had a job, it should be fairly easy to get a part-time job somewhere. Unless you have a medical condition?"
972,Yeah but I don't have a job silly. If I had money it would be easy to make money. You're not exactly helping me
973,Wow! That's pretty neat. Do you fish often?
973,"I do, especially fishing from a kayak. I go at least once a week."
973,"Nice. I've been trying to go more often, but work gets in the way. Will definitely have to try fishing from a kayak. "
973,You would love it. It is very fun. Do you have any other hobbies?
973,I'm a huge hockey fan. I play ice hockey in a community league. What about yourself?
973,Wow that's pretty cool. I love to go hiking. 
973,Any trails you recommend?
973,LOVE the mountains. Mainly in the New Mexico / Colorado area -- but also to the Alps. How about you?
973,"Haven't been hiking that much. Some friends have been talking about going for a while, so I thought I'd get some recommendations"
973,"Oh, than you might enjoy the Appalachian National Scenic Trail! It is fantastic."
973,Thanks! You seem really knowledgeable about the outdoors. What other activities do you do?
973,"Besides those two  no much. I am a engineer, so I don't really have much time. "
974,Next week! It'll really help with my career since I need to run around the city
974,that's great so did you get your liecense
974,"Not yet, next week I will hopefully. do you have yours yet?"
974,yes I got them i hated the parallel  parking part
974,oh yea parallel parking is hard. i'm in the city to be a fashion designer and i'll need to parallel park a lot. are you in a city?
974,yeah I'm in a very busy city chicago
974,"oh very cool i'm in nyc, i heard driving in chicago is hectic too"
974,yeah especially during rush hour
974,oh yea probably gridlock. I haven't had to drive all my years in the city yet til now
974,Yes sometimes the bus or train is better. I got a pink car so I can find it so many cars alike
974,"oh that is very cute, i hope to have a car inspired by alexander mcqueen"
974,Awww I love that movie
975,My two kids will be so disappointed. 
975,Treat them well and they will. 
975,I just recently went through a divorce and now this
975,That stinks that the marriage is terminated. 
975,I am thinking about having my mom bake something special for them.
975,You are so kind she will love that. 
975,"Yes, she is the best in our family at making cakes and stuff like that."
975,Do you have a lot of experience baking cakes? 
975,not as much as she does. Do you like to bake?
975,Actually- I love to bake. o if I could make big dough while making bread that would be perfect :-)
975,is bread your favorite thing to bake?
975,I like a good hard bread like pumpernickel. Do you know what that word means? 
975,What does it mean?
975,"It means fun in spanish, duh. "
975,"lol, that is funny"
975,"I can be kind of funny, or socially unacceptable at other times. "
976,"That is true. I still love it though, even though it's not healthy"
976,"oh , i see what you are saying . yes that's a valid perspective"
976,Thanks for understanding. Do you wear makeup?
976,yes i do. im former military and i used to not be able to wear makeup to work.
976,I guess it might have gotten in the way. I sell makeup and cosmetics to make a bit of extra money.
976,"that's awesome. i'm a truck driver now, it's decent money. and i can wear whatever i want!"
976,That is awesome. Do you sleep in the back of the truck sometimes?
976,"sometimes, i used to stay in a lot of hotels. what kind of makeup do you sell?"
976,"Avon, mostly. Did it get expensive staying in hotels often? Or was it covered by the truck company?"
976,"it was covered by the truck company, but i drive shorter distances now."
976,That's good. I imagine it gets a bit boring and lonely on the longer drives.
976,"It does, I keep myself entertained with music. what kind of music do you like?"
976,Rage metal mostly.
977,I am going to Seattle.
977,"Seattle? What, craving the rain??"
977,Its my favorite place to visit.
977,Why?? Big Frasier fan?
977,I just like the atmosphere.
977,Have you never seen Frasier?
977,Oh and I love Frasier.  Dr Crane is great.
977,Hm. You feel a bit like a robot.
977,I'm not.  I watched Frasier on Hallmark last night with my wife.
977,"If you really like Frasier, and you really watch it, tell me the most hilarious thing about the relationship between Niles and his wife Maris in the show"
977,Maris is actually Niles ex wife.
977,Alright you got me. But what is funny about their interaction?
978,"Maybe not, but I hope I can learn from my mistake."
978,Don't put too much pression on you. We all make mistakes. 
978,"I don't think my family can forgive me, especially my Mom."
978,I am pretty sure she will understand. 
978,I've never felt that she loves me; she's very harsh.
979,"That reminds me, I need to catch up on the episodes, I am so far behind."
979,You definitely should. 
979,There is just so many shows out. It is hard to find the time. 
979,definitely know the feeling !
979,So what other artists do you like?
979,Coldplay and Kings of Leon.  
979,I could go for some Coldplay right now. I love them.
979,Oh I like them too. I like that song I think it is called We Never Change
979,"They are definitely one of the artists I listen to when I am working. It keeps me focused, just the music and the numbers."
979,What do you do for work?
979,I am an accountant.
979,Accounting jobs are usually high paying
979,Depends on who you work for.
980,Well I get an employee discount. It is usually around 20% off.
980,You deserve the discount if you have to talk to customers all day. I have a hard time maintaining eye contact with people so that's hard for me
980,Oh I feel you on that one. Although I think it helped me settle in a little after moving for University.
980,What did you study in university
980,I studied computer science. Did you attend any university?
980,"Yes, Mechanical engineering. I lived in a dorm but my roommate didn't like me cause I sing in the shower"
980,"That's pretty funny. My roommate and I got along okay, but we didn't talk a whole lot."
980,Are you still friends with your roommate
980,No not really. He transferred to another school after a couple years.
980,I don't keep in touch with my ex-roommate either
980,That's life I guess. I ended up moving in with some people I still talk to though.
980,"Yes, people come and go in life. But it's hard to make new friends nowadays"
981,My husband is french and our child can naturally speak english and french without an accent showing either way is her primary language
981,"That's great. I'm a native spaker, but from what I understand English is very hard to actually learn"
981,I feel like that is true.
981,"Yeah some people dislike certain accents it is normal, It is difficult to measure or predict how long it takes an accent to formulate"
981,Yeah it is harder as we get older as well. I think thats why it is so cool for her to learn from the start
981,"Yes that is very true, and it pays off in the end too"
981,I am hopeful that it pays off for her when she is an adult and working.
981,I hope too. These things can truly effect your happiness and quality of life overall
981,Yes. I am wanting to homeschool her and feel like at this point I barely work so it is possible
981,Home school? How is that experience? I have always been fascinated by that idea
981,It is such a rewarding experience for families. My mom taught me that way and my husband is happy to know I want to teach our one little one.
981,What's the reason behind homeschooling really? Is it about the quality of education? Or personal finances?
981,Quality of education and flexibility in what you are able to teach your kids. You can explore in ways you cannot in public schools
982,"I think I'd say ""End of Watch."" Have you ever seen it?"
982,No I haven't. But now I want to see.
982,It's a police drama. Jake Gylenhaal is pretty good in it. 
982,"I generally like his movies, I'll have to check it out. What else do you like to do?"
982,I've been playing Apex Legends quite a bit but I am not very good.
982,"I haven't played that, but I do like video games. I actually was part of a testing group for a new video game this evening."
982,What type of game was it? I've always been curious how they decide whether to make games realistic or not.
982,It was a 3-d modeling game where you create avatars and then they battle each other.
982,Is it a lot different from what you usually play?
982,I just really started getting into simulation games. I like creating things. I'm really into clay models too so the sim games are fun for me
983,What do you love about winter?
983,I love the cold weather and being able to snuggle up! I also love that it's Christmas time!
983,"I love doing things outdoors when it's warm, especially fishing! Do you like being outdoors?"
983,"I do as long as it isn't too hot, but I live in the south so that isn't often! What else do you enjoy besides fishing?"
983,"Swimming! I'm lucky to have a pool. I'm in the south, too."
983,"Oh man, I want a pool more than anything! I'm sure you really enjoy it! So is summer your favorite season then?"
983,"Yes, because I like to go for midnight swims! Do you do any winter sports?"
983,"No, it's not cold enough here for winter sports. Do you have any big holiday plans?"
983,"No, my family lives out west, so it's pretty quiet around the holidays for me. How about you?"
983,My holidays are actually pretty quiet too. I have a very small family but I love being home a lot and getting to make holiday dishes!
983,"That's the one great thing about cold weather: baking, without heating up the house!"
983,I agree! I hope you have a great evening!
983,It was fun chatting with you!
984,I was able to spend the last days with her though which were special
984,That's good. It sounds like a happy ending.
984,What do you enjoy in your spare time? I love reading and playing with my dogs
984,I like to watch movies 
984,Any particular types?
984,Horror is my favorite genre. Followed by rom-com and then crime
984,"I love horror, thriller, and crime type movies also. Anything else and I need to bribe my husband to go hahaha"
984,Hehehe. But sadly they don't make any more nice horror movies. 
984,I agree. It is hard to find anything worth seeing in the theater. Now I just want til I can watch it at home
984,Yes and in the induction of more streaming services you could easily watch anything at home at your convenience.
984,Yes. I love watching movies where I have read the book. I like seeing if it matches up
984,"Yes I have met many people who does that. However I find books really boring, perhaps because I can not concentrate for very long."
985,I am thinking about Hawaii I like to go to the beach
985,"Wow, very nice, have you been there before?"
985,yes I used to work for a cable company and they sent me there once
985,What is it like there?
985,I have only been to Honolulu it is like a big city with a beach. I want to go to other islands.
985,Nice. I have heard that it is really humid.
985,I take rain everywhere I go even there
985,Hahah I love rain to be honest. It's only one thing that lightens up my mood.
985,I usually love rain but after a week of non stop rain I want sun 
985,A week? That's a long spell!
985,It rains a lot where I live. That is why I have to take trips to the beach.
985,I also want to go on a vacation sometime but I am always worried about my pets that I would have to leave behind.
986,Wow. Do you like the food there?
986,"i'm not much for fast food , but love to learn about different cuisines when i travel ."
986,I love their tradition and cultures.
986,I like exploring other cultures. How about you?
986,Of course. It's truly fascinating how much cultures we have in a single planet.
986,"Europe alone has many cultures. I have never been there, but I would like to."
986,"I would love to visit too. Honestly, it's the only place I would love to visit. Mainly because we share the same language."
986,"That's true, there's a lot of places I would like to go if I knew more languages. What new language would you like most?"
986,I would love to learn French.
986,French is a great pick. That's another place with great food.
986,It sure is. And some fashionable clothes.
986,Italy is known for fashion and food too. It seems like you can't go wrong no matter where you pick.
987,I like to bake a lot. It relaxes me. And I'm getting *slightly* better at giving away what I make rather than eating it all :)
987,"I'm also not that great at baking. My strength comes with cooking filipino food, it's a mix of Indian and Spanish influences."
987,"Oh, I've never had it, but it sounds delicious. I'm really getting into making different types of cookies. What are some Filipino desserts?"
987,"either pad thai or chocolate chip cookies . not mixed up , though !"
987,"No, I'd imagine not! Chocolate chip are my favorite. I need to stop with the carbs though. Between those and bagels--too much!"
987,"I don't eat too much breakfast but bagels, or the ring shaped bread product, are one of my favorites."
987,"Have you had the ""everything"" bagels? They have, well, everything you can think of on them. They're excellent"
987,Yes.  As a child we always called them 
987,What did you call them?
987,"It means the devil's fart, haha! Good bread though."
987,Haha! I'm sure the traditional name sounds better :)
987,They've also called them trenette or bavette - which i have no idea what those mean LOL!
988,kansas city
988,you have any hobbies?
988,I like rearranging breached horses
988,oh wow. I'm into fishing. Explain rearranging breached horses.
988,when a mare is delevering a colt but the colt is in a breached position I stick my hand in the who-ha and turn it around
988,"oh, i see. That is very interesting and difficult, i would imagine"
988,not really but it gets my jolly rodgers off
988,ok...any good burger joints around your town? 
988,if you like ecoli there is raykies
988,"I think I'll pass, lol. "
988,up to you! we all need a good cleansing everyonce in a while
988,"It sounds a little too aggressive to me. Aside from breached horses, what else do you do?"
988,well I sit on my keester and collect welfare
989,Nature is so wild up there; it must be amazing to see it up close!
989,I agree! Alaska is on my bucket list. Also on my bucket list is to see pandas in the wild one day.
989,"It's on mine, too! I'd love to say I've been to all 50 states! Wouldn't you love to pet a panda?"
989,"I would! They say nothing is ever black and white, but pandas TOTALLY are, lol. What's your favorite animal?"
989,"Ooh, that's a tough one...maybe otters, because they're just so playful!"
989,"Oh my gosh they're so great, like long water puppies! "
989,"LOL, I watched them going down a water slide, over and over...so fun and funny!"
989,"I love watching them at the zoo! Although as I get older, the more conflicted I feel about zoos. :( So is it getting cold where you are?"
989,"I know what you mean about zoos, me too. It's still warm here; I might have to mow my lawn again!"
989,"Oh gosh, we just mowed our yesterday! We had a cold snap and now it's super hot again. It's all whacked out these days :O"
989,"My tomato plants are blooming again, which is kind of fun, but, seriously...in October?!?"
989,"Aww what the heck, just in time for them to die before you get any real tomatoes and piss you off! D:"
990,I like thick crust too and local pizza is so good
990,Stuffed crust is the go to in our house.
990,Oh I have never had it but I have always wanted to try it. I love dipping the crust in dipping sauce.
990,Yeah the sauce is my favorite part.
990,I love to drive my car I think I will go pick up some pizza tonight
990,That sounds like a good idea.
990,What is  your favorite dipping sauce?
990,"Mine would be garlic, what about you?"
990,Mine too that zesty garlic is so good
990,I also ranch with my pizza sometimes.
990,I like to dip in pizza tomato sauce too
990,Yes that is my son's favorite.
991,College. Are you in school?
991,"Yes, I am studying creative writing."
991,Very cool. Who is your favorite author?
991,"Albert Camus is pretty interesting, but I also like non-fiction. Do you have a favorite?"
991,I enjoy reading Stephen King novels
991,Stephen King has some fun stuff. He has written so many books that I haven't gotten to all of them though.
991,I like to read the Bible too
991,"I haven't studied the bible very much, but it's definitely inspired a lot of stories."
991,I'm a seventh day adventist so I study it a lot
991,I miss my old church. It was nice being part of the same community for so long.
991,"I agree, that it is one of my favorite parts about it"
991,I don't really regret going away for school though. Everything is great but the cafeteria.
992,I still have to wait for more tests but I think it will be okay
992,I had to wait for test results like that once. It made me so aware of how much I love my life!
992,Yes I have to do lots of yoga to stay calm
992,"Yoga is great for getting calm and centered. I like Tai Chi for that, too!"
992,oh I should try that with my kids
992,i definitely recommend it! What else do you do to relax?
992,I like to get away on dates with my husband
992,What kinds of places do you like to go on your dates?
992,There are some very good restaurants in the area
992,"Oh, that sounds great. I've had some of my best conversations over a good meal!"
992,I love to eat too but it is hard to leave the kids and get away
992,"I hear you! I don't have kids, but I spend a lot of time with my little brother. He's a pest, but sweet!"
993,I like walking at the park near my place.
993,The lake at my home is where I fish.
993,How often do you fish?
993,Sometimes on the weekend.
993,Nice! How long have you been fishing for?
993,"All my life, do you like to fish?"
993,You must be an expert. I've been a few times when going camping.
993,I enjoy camping as well.
993,Been on any neat trips recently?
993,"No I am not much a traveler, do you travel a lot?"
993,I used to be. But haven't been able to recently because of work
993,Sorry to hear about that?
994,"Yeah, turned out ok overall."
994,"Oh that's great, I'm glad they fixed it! Will you ever go back there again?"
994,"Probably, gave good customer service and fixed the issue no worry."
994,Well good. Bad food experiences are ok as long as they are good about fixing it
994,"Accidents happen, so long as they're aware of it and fix it, I wouldn't stop service."
994,Yeah I agree. So what is your favorite place to eat at?
994,I'm a fan of Italian! You?
994,"Oh man, me too. Also mexican food, but my god I'll eat just about anything, lol! What's your fav italian dish?"
994,I could go for anything really... shrimp scampi?
994,"Oh nice! I am more plain and really love lasagna, but really anything tomato based is great. Or cream based, or lemon based.... Damn I'm hungry now D:"
994,"If I hadn't eaten earlier I'd for sure make something, but I think I'm all set for now. Everything's so good though!"
994,"So speaking of food, do you have a special holiday meal you make?"
995,He lives in Australia so we don't see each other very often
995,"That must be hard. Playing games together might be nice, but I wouldn't want to do it all the time."
995,"I don't have time to play games, I have to donate blood monthly in honor of my sister who died"
995,That's really sad. Donating is very good of you though. It's easy for me because they sometimes come to my school.
995,I'm not sure how I will donate once I move to Australia to marry my boyfriend
995,I hope your wedding goes well. I wasn't brave enough to try having a long distance relationship when I left for school.
995,Did you break up with your significant other?
995,"Yes, it was rough, but we wanted different things."
995,That is understandable. Are you in college?
995,"Yes, I like technology and didn't want to give up the chance to get my degree while I am young."
995,I hate technology. Especially PS4s
995,"ha, I understand. I am hoping to work on useful technologies."
996,drums
996,Drums can be very difficult to play
996,they had mastered the art they were so entertaining
996,So this person was quite experienced then. 
996,he has played drums for ten years now
996,Wow.  Ten years as a street performer?
996,no ten years playing drums but he came to the street 6months ago
996,Where did he play before performing on the street?
996,he used to play in church
996,"Interesting. Did he fully give up with playing at church, or is he still doing that also?"
996,he is still playing in church he goes to the street on his free time
996,That's pretty cool.  Does he make a good bit of money on the street?
997,I really want to get better at coding so I can develop my own game one day.
997,it can be fun and easy once you learn programming. there's so much you can do with it!
997,It seems like virtual legos. Once you know how to put them together there are endless possibilities! Is there a certain type of game you're interested in?
997,I like platformers! Simple to get started in but difficult to master. You?
997,"Hmmm, tough choice as I like a lot of genres! I like Moba's and MMO's, but I have a serious addiction to minecraft atm, lol"
997,"Minecraft's great. I've put probably thousands of hours into it, oops. So much to do."
997,Nice! What's the last thing you built on it? (If you can recall)
997,"It's been awhile, probably just a regular base, nothing super special."
997,Hey bases are cool too! lol  I'm working on a replica of the town in Stardew atm. Do you play games often?
997,"For sure! I'm a big fan of all games really, been back and forth between a few right now. Spyro and Slay the Spire mostly."
997,Omg Spyro was my absolute favorite game growing up. I bought the remake of it when it came out too. I'm glad you're enjoying it!
997,Yeah it's great! The remaster makes everything look so much better. Having a blast with it.
998,Oh you are correct. I love making colorful  patterens
998,I just finished making a little beaded skunk to decorate my purse. It looks great!
998,That sounds cool. Yeah I make my own patterns 
998,That's so cool! What kinds of patterns have you done?
998,I just mad a picture frame pattern. The one I really like is my dryer cover
998,I love learning lots of handcrafts. Do you have any others you enjoy?
998,oh yes I read a lot I also love to crochet 
998,"I do too, especially designing things to wear! Knitting is fun, but crochet was my first love."
998,Thats great. I never knitted before but said I want to try and learn
998,"There are lots of great videos to help you get started, but a human teacher is better, I think!"
998,Yes always better live teaching. I have seen online where they offer classes in my area
998,You should go for it!
999,It happens. I've been able to get by for the most part though.
999,that is a good attitude 
999,"Yeah, been watching a ton of ted talks about motivation and the like, helping a lot"
999,I love watching ted talks it is so motivational
999,"yeah theyre great, so many different experiences people have"
999,I totally agree it is very interesting to learn things from other people
999,any particular ones you like the most?
999,I like the ones that are about people's personal experiences
999,"yeah definitely, being able to understand people's viewpoints is really helpful."
999,Yes it can be helpful to watch other people's viewpoints. I also like to watch things with my children.
999,"I don't have kids but I have a few pets, they're basically my kids at this point."
999,sounds like you have as many animals as I have kids. I have 4 kids that is enough no pets needed.
1000,I work at a power plant and I cant trust cafeteria sushi
1000,How long have you been working at the power plant?
1000,As long as I can remember
1000,do you enjoy it?
1000,No I enjoy reading
1000,What books interest you?
1000,Books about power plants
1000,do you have any good recommendations ?
1000,Power Plants 101 by George P. Plant
1000,Sounds interesting. I will have to check it out.
1000,Let me know what you think
1000,Will do!
1001,I wonder if I can spend my days reading on the beach before going back to work
1001,That sound really relaxing! Can you afford the time off?
1001,Maybe only a short while. I also surf maybe I can teach.
1001,"That's really smart to use your hobbies to make money! I like to work on classic cars, could do that all day!"
1001,It is so great if we can make enough money from our hobbies but it is so hard
1001,"Yeah, tell me about it. Still, it's worth a lot to do something you really enjoy!"
1001,maybe losing my job will give me some motivation
1001,"LOL, that's a great attitude! What would your dream job look like?"
1001,I wish someone would pay me to sit on the beach
1001,"Hmm...maybe be a lifeguard, when you're not surfing?"
1001,that is an idea
1001,"I could walk on the beach for hours, just watching the waves come in!"
1002,That sounds exciting. What is your favorite song to dance to?
1002,There's so many it's hard to pick. I used watch so many disney musicals my family thought I wanted to be a princess.
1002,"I love musicals too, my favorite is Wizard of Oz"
1002,An absolute classic. The flying monkeys used to freak me out though.
1002,What is your favorite musical?
1002,"I really liked the Lion King musical. Hamilton is good too, but I grew up with the Lion King."
1002,"Excellent choice. There is so much learn from the whole musical, and lots of good music too"
1002,What sort of music do you like? I bet they weren't playing many musicals at the bar.
1002,I love Blues. Have you listened to this genre before? 
1002,Of course! The blues have inspired so many genres.
1002,They usually play Blues on Fridays at the local bar. It is my favorite day
1002,"I should go out to such things more. It'd be another chance to dance, after all."
1003,everyone is interesting!

1004,"Why hello, father! I'm a professional video game player and steak taster! lol"
1004,That's a wild combination. Do you play chess?
1004,"I do, but rarely. I can play a decent round of Tetris though! Are you a big chess player?"
1004,"I play all the time at the senior living homes. Only visiting, not a resident quite yet! I thought maybe you'd like a classic strategic game. "
1004,I'm a terrible strategist! I taught my son to play a few years ago though so we have matches on occasion.
1004,That sounds very fun. I teach it in the youth groups sometimes for fun also. Not quite as good at teaching chess as I am the bible.
1004,What's your favorite biblical story?
1004,I'd have to say Joseph in the book of Genesis 37-50.
1004,I'm sure your community learns a lot from you! How long have you been a priest?
1004,"About fifteen years now, I had a little bit of a late calling to serve further. You never told me your favorite biblical story."
1004,"Hmm, I think maybe the story of Samson. That was a rough one for me. Betrayal is such a sad thing. But lots of that in the bible I suppose."
1005,Well in London we admire artists

1008,"Wow, great name; I hadn't heard of them. Will have to look them up!"
1008,You should it is worth it.  I watch a lot of YouTube late at night.
1008,"Sounds like you're a night owl, too!"
1008,Oh I wish I could sleep 
1008,"My go-to cure for insomnia is to read until I drop the book, lol. What works for you?"
1008,that is a good idea I should try that I have more trouble getting to bed than sleeping I work long hours as a vet
1008,"I love animals, but I don't think I could do that!"
1008,I understand it is not for everyone my cat is pestering me right now. Do you have pets?

1011,"Oh, man, I hope not! LOL. I'd rather eat duck, or pasta or something."
1011,I hope no one eats my dog Bob
1011,"Well, it wouldn't exactly be cannibalism, but still, he's like a member of your family, right?"
1011,"yes did you see PETA's ad campaign they told people they gave them dog milk, it was really soy milk"
1011,I avoid PETA like the plague. I've read too much about their unethical practices.
1011,I thought it was a really mean campaign but don't really understand why people are opposed to dog milk and not opposed to cow milk
1011,"Yeah, so much stuff we thing of as ""right"" and ""wrong"" just depends on what we're used to."
1011,I guess that is true I wonder if in a 100 years things will be different

1018,I'm too afraid to visit most places because I dont know where to park
1018,I don't have that problem. Wheelchairs aren't great but the parking spaces are a nice perk.
1018,Imagine if you had a powered chair though
1018,I'd zoom all over the place. If I ever get one I'll have to figure out which museums are the biggest so I have more room.
1018,I'm quite confident so I like to zoom around museums just by running. Silently though
1018,"I wonder if museum ninjas are more common in Japan. I've never been there, after all."
1018,"They sure do, I know that Japan is full of surprises when it comes to ancient samurais and ninjas."
1018,"I'd like to imagine that in France there's lots of baguettes in the museums, but that might be because I am hungry."
1018,Mostly just paintings of French girls
1018,That sounds like a great reason to go to the Louvre.
1018,Hopefully they have easy parking

1020,I'm single for now. It allows me independence. Do you guys plan to have a big wedding or just a friends and family gathering? 
1020,Probably just friends and family. After the move there won't be much money left for a big wedding..
1020,That's understandable. I've never been out of the United States. Have you visited Austrilia before? 
1020,Only once before. It's very different. You should travel outside the US one day. It's fun.

1039,"I never used to like baking, too many rules. I really like it now though. The sourdough is especially interesting."
1039,Did you think about starting baking business? :)
1040,it mean your husband is busy and have little time to clean and organize.
1040,"Well, Being that I love to volunteer free time at nursing homes it's inconsiderate of him"
1040,we need to concentrate more on our work
1040,It's not terrible cleaning I am pretty tall. How about your are you tall?
1040,"yes, same here also. it is difficult to cleaning the house"
1040,Oh well I have high cabinets being tall actually helps me. That's a shame for you. 
1040,What is the height of tall kitchen cabinets?
1040,Well they are about 4 feet in height but are already 5 feet off the ground
1040,it is little bit difficult only
1040,"What about yourself, any special quirks or traits you have?"
1040,What is a quirky trait?
1040,It is a unique quality that someone has.
1041,yes very comfortable.
1041,Contacts just seem a lot easier to me than wearing glasses.
1041,yes and it looks nice. i used to wear green colored contacts. 
1041,I think that's an awesome color. My mom wears contacts too.
1041,oh thats cool. what about your favourite author?
1041,I don't have a favourite author. I used to read a lot of Stephen King books when I was a teen though.
1041,oh that is nice. 
1041,"Yeah, Stephen King was a classic. He wrote really good horror & supernatural novels. Do you have a favorite author?"
1041,yes my favorite one is Stephen king only. i love his books. 
1041,Great! What are the chances that we both read him?! 
1041,may be 100%.. what say?
1041,"I'd say 100%! My mom, who's living with me at the mo', just said she thinks so too! Lol!"
1042,I would absolutely try it if it was prepared well. 
1042,I suppose it wouldn't be too bad. They're related to doves and people eat them. I bet they'd make a nice romantic dinner.
1042,I've had quail before and really enjoyed it. 
1042,I was studying about birds but ended up failing because I didn't do much homework
1042,Oh no. Did you not find the subject interesting enough?
1042,"No, I enjoyued the subject but ended up spending all my time with my girlfriend. Do you hunt?"
1042,I have bow hunted before but that is larger game like deer. It's been several years. You?
1042,"I did when I was younger, deer and birds, dove actually. I spend most of my time outdoors now shooting with my camera."
1042,That is something I enjoy these days as well. I enjoy running nature trails and finding interesting photo locations.
1042,It's always nice to get out on the trails and share those moments. It's even better when you have someone tagging along.
1042,I agree. Sadly most of my friends don't enjoy nature or exercise as much as I do.
1042,"Same with me, I hope one day to run into the love of my life on one of those trails. Share a sunset or something."
1043,I can't handle bugs. Sometimes we find gross spider nests in furniture at work.
1043,I hate spiders too. They are gross
1043,"Yeah. I don't kill them but I try to move them outside. We have those giant palmetto bugs here, like gigantic cockroaches. They're the absolute worst."
1043,I kill them once I spot them. They are dangerous.
1043,"Spiders? I don't think most are dangerous. And they eat bugs. But I don't like them either, so I understand."
1043,Do you like music?
1043,Sure. I like hip hop mostly. What kind of music do you like?
1043,I like all genres. Justine Bieber is my favorite musician
1043,Oh she sounds great. Do you have any hobbies?
1043,Ilike outdoor activities like camping with friends
1043,Me too. We're going camping in the florida keys in a couple weeks. 
1043,That sounds great. Are you going with friends?
1044,Not really.  Rather go to store so i can see what i'm buying
1044,Do you like to drink?
1044,Not really. I'm more of an ice tea kind of person
1044,Oh thats too bad. I really love me a double bourbon on the rocks
1044,Never was much of a drinker.
1044,You like children's books?
1044,Not really. I'm more of an outdoor person. Spend most weekends out on my mountain bike
1044,"Oh nice, I love riding around my fatbike, live right by a state trail. Just 5 min ride to the river!"
1044,cool lot of fresh air
1044,"Yes indeed, it is so nice, especially with all the wildlife!"
1044,I'm ready to go. Can
1045,Do you enjoy sushi?
1045,"Yeah, I like sushi, but not if it has raw fish in it. You? You like sushi?"
1045,"I'm like you, not raw. I'm the youngest of 8 kids so we basically had to eat what mom cooked."
1045,"Nothing like mom's cooking! I miss my mom 'cos I'm in the navy, so don't get to see her much."
1045,Oh wow. Well thank you for your service. Do you get to travel to cool places?
1045,"Yes, last month I went to to Panama City, Florida."
1045,Have you been out of the country with the Navy?
1045,"Not yet, but next year, we're going to Greece for six months."
1045,I've never been out of the US so that's really exciting. 
1045,I hope you get to travel out of the US one day. :)
1045,Same here. Maybe I'll go to Paris. I'm always looking for love. Are you married?
1045,"Paris sounds good. No, I'm single. I might get married one day."
1045,Goodnight :)
1045,"Thanks! Hope you have a good night, too. Bye!"
1046,i hate my job when i do not get promotion.
1046,It's really tough. Why do you think you didn't get it?
1046,i tried to figure out but i did not get the answer.
1046,I am the same way. I think I should consider a new job.
1046,yes but in a big cities there are no jobs and i am just graduated so for me its very tough to get a new one
1046,That's quite unfortunate. I feel for you as I used to live in a small town where jobs were scarce. It's rough when there is no competition
1046,yaa but when there is more competition there is less job oppertunities.
1046,There are often more places hiring though. My current employer is the only one in the area. I would need to move to change jobs.
1046,then shift somewhere. you'll have to apply for more jobs.
1046,I really like the friends I have and my current living situation let's me keep my dogs. It's a lot to consider.
1046,yes but you have to choose between career and these stuffs. it is all depends on an individual.
1046,That's very true. I really wish I had gotten this promotion but it may be time to dust off my resume.

1054,That's great. What else do you and your kids like to do?
1055,I tried being a doctor but they didn't care for my blue and orange hair.
1055,That shouldn't matter. The doctors I see on the show have a lot more wrong than colored hair.

1058,So blue looks better on you?
1058,"Well, it depends on you definition of better! I mean, heck , my favorite food is mac and cheese but I don't wear it on my head!"
1058,That sounds like something my little brother would say. I have 3 brothers by the way!

1070,"Man that's insane, it's like a foreign horror movie. How are you feeling now, still uneasy?"
1070,alot better but i still have nightmarees
1070,"I have nightmares whenever I watch those kinds of movies on my computer for hours, I can't imagine how frightening yours must be after a real experience. "
1070,pretty traumatic
1070,Do you think it was somebody trying to spook you during the halloween season or a real psychopath? Not that there's much difference lol...
1071,I was so happy that I cooked a healthy meal for myself to celebrate
1071,I am glad you had such a good meal. Its important to have a balanced diet :) 
1071,"That is true, I might just become a vegan one day."
1071,"That will really help you to maintain your overall health. But still, im not sure if i can actually complete the whole vegan lifestyle."
1071,"You can try it one day, so what do you enjoy in your leisure"
1071,"Not being vegan, eating to much pizza and mcdonalds. Completely unhealthy. Work it all off in exercise though."
1071,"interesting, I like going on dates."

1071,That's right i date women. Been on a lot of dates.
1071,Dating is fun.
1071,Yes it is if you meet an interesting person.
1072,I am not sure! I am recently divorced and my ex-husband came by to pick up a few things. I think that is when she got out!
1072,thats too bad. I'm sorry to hear about the dog. I can empathize with you - my dog got loose at the beach and it took days to find her.
1072,"Well, glad you found her! If I had kids I would send them out to help me but I don't have any children of my own. What about you?"
1072,I have 3 kids. but they are all grown adults now. 
1072,I am still young so I may have kids of my own one day.
1072,yeah you will when the time is right. I waited until my late 20's 
1072,"I am in my early 20's. So, yeah, I still have plenty of time. "
1072,yes you do. look at me - Im 50 and still a lifeguard at the beach. I love my job - it makes me happy to help people.
1072,That is great! When I was in high school I always thought it would be cool to be a lifeguard!
1072,I have been a lifeguard since college - its a part time gig now but still I love doing it

1073,That is cool. I like to make vegan dessert. You should try the vegan meat it good
1073,I have tried it in the past but I found it gross. I know it's much better nowadays so maybe I should give it another try.
1073,What is your favorite part of walking dead
1073,I love seeing how the different characters react to the different life & death situations.
1073,ok
1073,What's your favorite part of the show?

1074,oh that sounds good.my whole family loved the raisin roll and cherry cola flavor lollipops. 
1074,Same. Even my boxer dog tries to eat them when we're not looking.
1074,Haha . hh wow...it states that lollipop loved by all souls.i think i want to be a professional eater with concern about my health 
1074,The dream! What other foods would this career involve?
1074,i think all meats and cheese.i want to be a professional eater but not even think that i will become a fat person.it disturbs me a lot
1074,"Well as long as it's all balanced out in moderation, it shouldn't be a problem "

1075,Yeah they loved it! Do you have any favorite hobbies?
1075,I adore going to the beach to listen to the waves and for long walks.
1075,I love to dance. I'm actually a ballet dancer.
1075,"That's so cool! Ballet looks so elegant to me, but so difficult. It has quite the history, considering it originated in the Italian Renaissance in the 15th century."
1075,Its is difficult. You have to love it do well at it.
1075,I can imagine that you really do have to love it. I like dancing too - no form in particular - I just dance.

1076,"Yeah, though I am still waiting for to release another hit."
1076,know what you mean. You've got to admit Roar is a great track though. In fact that whole album (Prism) is pretty great.
1076,It was pretty great. I think the reason for the pause on music may be because she want to get married
1076,"Oh she really wonna get married, wow I never knew"
1077,It is about Depression and how the Characters where able conquer it.
1077,That seems an interesting read.
1077,"Yeah, you can bet it would. What do you have interest in?"
1077,"I love music, I have been listening to creed lately."

1078,"Yeah I get an Egg McMuffin every morning before work, fruit and nuts for the rest of the day.  You gettin' fit?"
1078,"wow that sounds like a nice routine! I'm trying to get in shape, but I just love food so much! I probably eat too much"
1078,As long as you stay mathematically efficient it's not too damaging to partake in limited portions of fast food.
1078,That's true. I just need to watch my quantities. Do you have any bad habits?
1078,"Oh yeah my liver hates me. Big into iced vodka. And yeah if you eat big lift big man, hit the bench press."
1078,"I'm not a big drinker. I already talk too much when I'm sober, so I think it's in my best interest to stay away from liquor!"
1078,Yeah god bless eh. One day I'd like to open my own distillery and make my own vodka. Maybe right next to a house on the beach. That's the dream.

1080,It's been the next big thing for centuries. We couldn't survive without them.
1080,yeah. But people are not really going into it. 
1080,That's true. We've become more urbanized but farms are still very important.

1082,Why do you not want children?
1082,I don't have the desire to have any.
1082,Same. Parents put a lot of pressure for me to have them 
1082,"I'm sorry - it's unfair of them to do that. Because I don't want any, I've fallen out with lots of my family. I don't like them."
1083,"I do , but afraid to try"
1083,I feel the exact same! The icing is normally too rich and sweet for me.

1085,What kind of dance do you do?
1085,all kinds of dance actually.

1086,"Yeah, I like is book especially The shining"
1086,Do you prefer the book or the movie version? I don't think Stephen King liked the movie version much.

1093,"No, someone just beat me on the final exam. It was totally unfair!"
1093,"Ugh, I am sorry. That has to be the worst feeling!"
1093,"Thanks, I'm glad you understand. My school was really tough too, what about you?"
1093,I had a pretty cutthroat school too; I had to do honors and study a lot to make it. It was worth it though!
1093,Worth it? Did being a valedictorian help you?
1093,It made my mom happy since she raised me and my siblings alone. It also got me a scholarship for a bit.
1094,Where do you keep that many cats?
1094,We keep them where we can in the house. They're safe and clean either way.
1094,Have you heard that cats kill 4 billion birds a year in in the U.S alone?
1094,"No I didn't, is that a real fact. They must be great hunters then."
1094,They are pretty sneaky
1094,"True, plus they can be really small, only a few centimeters long, so easy to hide."
1094,"What, do you mean the birds are easy for the cat to hide? like if their trying to sneak one up to their room?"
1094,"No, the cats are sneaky so they like to hide."
1094,i think cats are just lazy buggers who choose to lounge around doing nothing

1097,I'm too out of practice for that now. Do you believe in karma?
1097,To an extent. You?
1097,I'm a big believer in karma. That's why I always try to do the right thing. Maybe I'm too superstitious.
1097,"I think regardless of karma, good things will happen to you if you continue to do the right thing"
1097,I hope you're right! Good luck with your piano playing.
1098,"I might try that, thank you. I don't have much extra spending money lately with the new baby here and all wax is cheap."
1098,I think grooming and trimming and using a wax might help from what I have read .
1098,"What kind of wax is the best, organically speaking. I hear beeswax is good but does it work for facial hair removal"
1098,"yes it does, i heard it works greatly for it."
1098,"Oh that would be amazing. I'm a neat freak, I can't stand when things are unorganized, including my face."

1099,I am a packaging operator.
1099,"That's cool..I,m biotect graduate but unemployed"
1099,That's nice. I hope you get a Job soon. Where would you like to work?
1099,Thank you . Not specific anything is better than nothing
1099,You shouldn't settle for anything. The universe has abundance for us all.
1099,K..But its hard to find in specific area
1099,what can I say. I wish you luck in your Job search.

1099,How do you fend without a job?
1099,My family supports me

1106,I'll try.
1106,"Go for a walk, take some fresh air, be happy at all times"
1106,Sounds like solid advice. You sound like a counselor yourself.
1107,"well i sort of believe it i=was just good luck,  for i never saw it coming."

1138,I have no other pets.
1139,If it is really affecting someone maybe they should go see a Dr for some advice?
1139,"Not only professional help, they can support our individual feelings when we're in a time of need."
1139,"Yeah, I always think talking things over with someone is a good idea."
1139,Yes. It is really beneficial when you're not feeling great. I like talking to my friends about my life and my ambitions.
1139,What are your ambitions?
1139,I would really like to speak another language so that I can go and live abroad for a few years. I would really like to like in Spain or France.

1139,"Aaah yes, italian food is the best!  I also love lasagne but also the fresh tomato and mozzarella salads in the summer!"
1139,"Ohh! I love mozzerella, especially in a nice fresh salad!"
1139,This conversation is making me hungry!  I miss the summer already.
1139,But at least Christmas is around the corner. I love Christmas just as much as the summer!
1140,Sometimes I have problem feeling my true emotion.
1140,"Hmmm, me too"
1140,I think this because my parents are so distant that I have attachment issues.
1140,"Although my parents are also distant, but i keep moving "
1140,You have to because life goes on.
1140,"Yeah, we just have to take like per day. i love to go hiking"

1143,ohhh....busy is better than boring
1143,"yes , i guess it is . what else do you enjoy ?"
1144,that does sound interesting. I really like cats too so any games that include them is also fun

1145,It is the view that all human beings will ultimately be restored to a right relationship with God.
1145,gotcha
1145,God is always there for you and always will be.
1146,It was just alien to me.

1159,That sounds fun!  Have you been anywhere that stands out?
1159,The furthest I've been is Germany. I went as a teenager and really enjoyed it. Where is your favorite place you've been?
1159,I'd love to visit Germany!  Montana was the most beautiful place that I've ever been. 
1160,hmm i gave him some money 
1160,"oh okay. that's really sweet of you. as i travel around, i've noticed more homeless people."
1160,felt very sad for those people who dont have their home to live
1160,"I understand, I feel the same way sometimes. It's hard because sometimes you can't help or know they have problems that made them homeless like drinking."
1160,i agree with you...
1160,Sometimes i wonder what their story is.. i see them when i travel for work and i just stop and just wonder.
1160,i hope they will have very sad story behind their life like this
1160,i'm sure they have some sort of sadness.
1160,i always pray god for better life for everyone
1160,People need to step up and start helping others. I will pray too
1160,yeah change should  come with the people
1160,i agree . another thing we can do to fix the world we live in .
1161,Yes! That's why i decided to only start taking the bus from now on.
1161,"I sure hope you are ok.  Traffic collisions often can cause injury, even death."
1161,I am fine now but thank you so much for asking.
1161,you are welcome . what do you like to do for fun ?
1161,I really like playing sports. What about you?
1161,I like designing but I have 6 siblings so I'm always attending events and parties with them which is nice
1161,Awesome! Sounds fun. How often do you take the bus?
1161,Almost every week ends. And you?
1161,I take it all the time because i'm trying to save money for my bills.
1161,"Yeaaah, I know a lot of people who struggle with bills."
1161,It's the struggles of being an adult
1161,yeah but there are a lot of programs that help!
1162,I wish I could wear a toga all the time. Sometimes I see people wearing them on youtube videos. They look so cute!
1162,"I see girls wearing them virtually everyday, i like to party, what about you"
1162,"Yes, I love to go out and dance. Sometimes I'll practice my dance moves by watching videos on youtube. How do you learn?"
1162,"you tube videos sometimes, but most of the time i just do me"
1162,"What else do you like to do? I read a lot, but I don't like using adobe to read portable documents. I use a third party program. "
1162,i work part time at a pizza restaurant close by
1162,That sounds like a good job. I love pizza! I like to post on youtube since I am on it so much. You can make a lot of money.
1162,"yeah, i love it too"
1162,I also love to eat pasta as well. There are many PDFs with recipes. What do you like to eat?
1162,pasta
1162,We eat whole wheat pasta because it is healthy for you. Then I exercise with my youtube videos. Do you exercise?
1162,Sometimes i do too
1163,Have you seen three wheeler motorbikes?
1163,"Yes! I actually own 2 of them.  I like the fact that they are still considered a small motorcycle, but they have a less strict licensing procedure."
1163,Are the two wheels at the front?
1163,"no, they at the back"
1163,Is that for stability or style?
1163,"yes, i like your accent where you from "
1163,"If you accelerate too fast, then I would suspect that the front one wheel would come off the road!"
1163,oooh all that physics makes my head spin
1163,But turning corners should be safer. What do you think?
1163,"The inversions, tight turns and steep slopes scare me lol"
1163,Going up or down the slope? I think either way would be exhilarating!
1163,"I'm not sure honestly, I would assume they are different even though they both involve descending a slope."
1164,"Really, I love basketball.  I actually play professionally."
1164,Cool. I used to play in high school but not so much anymore. Any favorite players you keep up with?
1164,I like to follow players from Maryland which is where I went to college.
1164,I like Lebron James personally. What do you think of him?
1164,I think he'
1164,"Sorry I didn't catch that, can you say it again."
1164,"I think he's over-hyped a little, but still a fantastic player.  I wish I had his skills."
1164,He definitely is cool to watch.
1164,"I wonder if he'll ever want to coach, or just retire when he's done playing."
1164,I think he probably would.
1164,"If he does, it will because he truly loves the game.  He certainly won't need the money."
1164,Yeah he seems to have that desire to be the best.
1165,Sounds like she had a great story. What is your favorite brand of clothing?
1165,i love anything with fashion that doesn't include animals
1165,Interesting. Well my favorite brand is Donna Karan.
1165,What is her style?
1165,It's more of a dressy and office wear.
1165,oh i see . are you a designer
1165,I am not. I just sing in a choir on sundays.
1165,good job! maybe you should pursue a singing career :)
1165,I hope so but i think i am not good enough!
1165,well maybe you should try sing-along songs instead as then you don't need the lead vocalist.
1165,That's a great idea. Maybe i can do that!
1165,"well , if you can tackle stage fright in your band , running should be easy ."
1166,I hope so and if not I will just go home and play with my dogs
1166,haha dogs always want to go out and play.
1166,"yes they do, but they are so loveable and non judgemental"
1166,Ha Ha. They all are until they run.
1166,I haven't had one run away yet even when I am playing video games and not watching them
1166,what kind of video games are you into
1166,I really enjoy league of legends but also love Call of Duty
1166,have you heard of pubG?
1166,nope what is that?
1166,it is where you pick real players to be on your team.
1166,huh that sounds like fun
1166,well if you want to play against someone let me know .
1167,"No, I miss her. I may go back to my home country in Russia."
1167,That's understandable. Did you meet her in Russia? 
1167,"I did, she was great. We were both into fitness, and wanted to come to the States but now, she's gone."
1167,That sounds hard.  Let's switch gears and talk about fitness. You like to workout?
1167,I do! I'm a weight lifter and I compete from time to time. I guess that's my second love. What about you?
1167,How much can you lift?
1167,Right now I'm up to 300lbs! I want to be to 400 by next year!
1167,thats a great goal! 
1167,Thank you! I appreciate you helping me get my mind off of things. Maybe I just need to keep focusing on lifting and things will get better.
1168,I would love it if they would read more.
1168,yes. prepare them to read more
1168,It's hard to get them to go outside and do something when the temperatures are so high.  They want to stay inside.
1168,the best place to get them reading is indoor
1168,"They are pretty active kids.  They might read for a little while, then they want to do something else."
1168,oooh. there is way you get around that
1168,"We have a vacation planned for next week.  Hopefully, that will make everyone feel better."
1168,oh it will definitly
1168,Do you have kids?
1168,just one for now
1168,I am finishing up a home I am remodeling this week.  Then it's off to the beach.  
1168,"that sounds great, would you be leaving with the family"
1169,I don't have any tattoos because i don't like talking to people. Going to a tattoo parlor would be hard for me.
1169,You don't have to talk that much. My tattoos are all of cats. Do you like them?
1169,"I love cats, dogs, and dragons as well!"
1169,you should consider it! it would look cool
1169,I might get all three! I love dragons because i think they are real
1169,"They could definitely be real if they look differently than that.  Sometimes, they are depicted with legs like a lizard, which makes it more believable."
1169,That's true! I just love dragons so much. They are so magical
1169,I think they would make my life worth living.
1169,It would be amazing to look in the sky and see a dragon
1169,"Agreed, that would be badass."
1169,What is your favorite animal? Is it the cat?
1169,I have a cat. Her name is Venus. I rescued her from outside after she was attacked by a dog.
1170,My parents! They really like to leave messes like I am their maid.
1170,Did you tell them they had to clean it up? I know it is hard if they are your parents. 
1170,"I did but I feel although they try, it doesn't always work. I feel like they're the children and I'm their mom."
1170,They may think it is right they are doing it because they raised you. But I agree it isn't fair. What had you eaten? I like Italian.
1170,I cooked them roast beef but I LOVE italian. 
1170,I really like real Italian food. it is so good. I love to eat it while I listen to Iron Maiden. 
1170,oh nice. what is your best italian dish you can cook.
1170,I make lasagna my grandparents made 120 years ago. It is so delicious. Lots of sauce and cheese. What about you?
1170,"oh i want some! lol. i don't cook italian really. just your regular comfort foods like meatloaf, spaghetti, and stir fries. "
1170,I like to cook all different thing. I will listen to Iron Maiden as I cook and dance. I also like Mexican food. 
1170,i love mexican too. and indian.
1170,I like all different food. Indian is also very tasty. I can eat almost anything.
1171,"Yes, I was scared of the dark. I also had terrible nightmares."
1171,"the same about me, but I guess it's Ok for any child."
1171,"Yeah, I think it's pretty much expected. Thankfully, I don't deal with it anymore."
1171,"Me too. However, I still read a lot of fantasy as I were in my childhood. "
1171,What kind of fantasy books do you like to read?
1171,"harry potter is one example, but it's the best over time. Of course, I've read ""A Game of Thrones"" as well. "
1171,"My sister loves Harry Potter. I never really could get into it, though. I was more into the cheesy romance novels."
1171,"It's cool, but it's not for everyone. I also love science fiction."
1171,"I like some sci-fi, as well. I really liked watching The Twilight Zone when I was younger."
1171,"I guess we are about the same age, because I also liked it when I was younger. Do you like to watch movies?"
1171,"Yes, I love watching movies. I really like the old black & white ones. What kind do you like?"
1171,"i enjoy the conjuring series , but also classics like texas chainsaw and friday the 13th ."
1172,That's so interested. Do you have any other hobbies?
1172,I don't have any other hobbies. I just really love listening to one direction because they are my favorite.
1172,"They are great. I love pink, the singer."
1172,That's awesome. She's a great artist. What are your hobbies?

1173,"k..i live in durham,uk"
1173,What do you like to do?

1174,Thank you. I like to stay humble and keep good morals
1174,"Yeah, down to earth people are the best. Something homely about them"
1174,but you dont find people like that easy these days
1174,"No, its very difficult to find people you bond with"
1175,It is the trailer from the movie 22 miles. A story about a CIA operative in Southeast Asia.
1175,"sounds interesting, do you mind giving me a brief story about it"
1175,"I wish I could, but I have not seen the movie. It did not get a good rating from Rotten Tomatoes."
1175,"oh, i see, maybe would go check it out"
1175,"Sure, I can do a search and get some info."
1175,"that would be great, i work as a public affairs liaison, what about you"
1175,I work at a golf course in the Pro Shop. Love my job.
1175,wow. golf? tell me about it

1177,I like board games too. I like to spend time outdoor in nature. 
1177,I love the outdoors too ! Very peaceful. Our environment should be protected for generations to come  
1177,I whole heartedly agree. I try to do everything I can to ensure I'm doing my part to protect the planet. 
1177,We need more people like you. The world would be a better place.
1177,You're a good person too! 
1177,you are too kind. Do you ave a family ?
1178,"Yeah, who wouldn't be disappointed not getting a car?"
1178,I get it though - my dad bought my brother (he's in the army) a car when he finished basic training
1178,"Well, that was a nice thing to do. Did your dad buy you a car?"
1178,No. i had to work for everything I had. But my parents always helped out my silbings. 
1178,"Oh, that's not good. I'm the oldest child, so it was kind of the same for me. Are you the oldest sibling?"
1178,i am! they expect me to take care of people. I have 2 nephews that i take care of too.
1178,"Yikes! I know how you feel. Since I'm the oldest, I'm expected to take care of everything. It's tough."
1178,but it gives you a sense of happiness when you help people out too
1178,"Yeah, it does. I actually do like helping people as long as it doesn't mess with my own well-being."
1178,"that's true, you need to look out for yourself first"
1178,"Yeah, that's one thing I'm trying to get better at. What kind of things do you do for self-care?"

1179,Usually my family takes a trip to the beach.  How about you?
1179,"I live fairly near the beach, so we go quite frequently"
1179,"I love going to the beach, but we live in the mountains."
1179,I guess they both have their own qualities - I would really like to visit the mountains
1179,"They are beautiful, especially in the fall.  I live near a state park, so we get a lot of tourists."
1179,"Ah yeah, I live in a fairly popular holiday spot as well. The town gets so busy during summer months, it can actually get quite annoying."
1180,Creepshow i think. Sounds like fun
1180,"possibly . his name is stephen king , you know"

1181,"Oh wow, be careful working so hard. I had 2 books published actually, one self-help book and a fiction book."
1181,2 books! That's great. What was the fiction book about? 
1181,Thanks! The fictional book was about a teenage girl who developed mysterious powers and she's trying to learn of her origins.
1181,Oh cool. So its a bit like Harry Potter then. Are you going on vacation this year? 
1181,"I guess you could say that, but she has superpowers and can't understand how to control them. I may go on vacation, I haven't decided yet. Are you?"
1181,Yeah i'm off to Seattle. Its my favourite city. I really like the Pacific North West. Have you ever been? 
1181,"That sounds amazing! I've actually never been before, but it sounds great. I wonder if there are any peaceful places to clear the mind and write?"
1181,There are some quieter areas around the Olympic National Park but its a bit of a drive from the City. Do you own a car?
1181,"I do, I finally decided to be more conscious about my carbon foot-print and finally purchased a hybrid car."
1181,Oh cool a hybrid. I've heard some good things about those. So you're worried about climate change?

1182,yes sometimes it is agressive and unsociable..
1183,I love dogs... can't wait to eat my favorite pizza today. 
1183,"Nice, I love dogs too, especially labs,  What is your favorite pizza?"
1183,"Pepperoni and triple cheese, but I just can eat it once a month. "
1183,That sounds good.  What do you do for a living?  I'm in the pharmaceutical field.
1183,That sounds interesting. I work in a supermarket. 
1183,Very cool.  That's one place everyone needs to go!  Do you like physical activity like hiking or working out?
1183,I love working out. I go to the gym everyday. What about you?
1183,"I don't workout as much as I want, I have three kids, so they keep me busy.  "
1183,"I am sure they do. But if you at least do it twice a week, it is better than nothing."
1183,"True.  Do you like outdoor activity like hiking, fishing etc.?"
1183,I like to hike and camping. What about you?

1185,I know what you mean. What other music do you listen to?
1185,I like classic rock mostly.  I really want to get a Corvette so I can ride around with the top down and listen to it.
1185,"A little red corvette? Haha. I really like classic rock, too. Queen is my favorite band. Whats yours?"
1185,Guns and Roses and Metallica are my favorites.  Believe it or not they are classic rock now.  I like Aerosmith and others too.
1185,"I know! It makes me feel old. Classic Rock stations are even playing Pearl Jam and Nirvana, too."
1185,"I know, I still refuse to believe 90's bands are classic rock.  I do like Queen though.  Freddy Mercury was an amazing singer,"
1185,"Yeah, he was. And he seemed like a great person, too. Are there any other genres you like?"
1185," I like Country for a bit in the 90's, even saw the Dixie Chicks once. I didn't care for their lead singer."
1185,"I really like 90s country, too. Shania Twain was my favorite. I also like Brooks & Dunn."
1185,"Yeah, Shania Twain was pretty good.  Maybe she could ride around with me in my Corvette."
1185,Maybe she would if you asked nicely. 
1186,"It was awful, but at least we were together and comfort each other. "
1186,I would have been so scared
1186,"To be honest, I was not that scared. "
1186,oh well i wasn't scared anyways
1186,True. What do you for a living?
1186,I would love to work in a hip clothing store
1186,That's interesting. I am professional animals trainer.
1186,"That would  be an interesting profession, my dad is a trainer too but I dont speak to him"
1186,Why not?? Do you have any problems?
1186,he is a dead beat and he doesnt like the way I dress
1186,"I am sorry to hear that. I kind of have the same problem with my wife, but she is a cancer survivor. I have to be easy on her"
1186,"sorry to hear that, it makes it hard when someone doesnt like anything about you"
1187,they always have my back and support me
1187,Sounds like you have a great family.
1188,My main hobby is reading. I'm really into harry potter. Have you ever read them?
1188,I love Harry Potter.  I also act out sword fighting with other actors in the local park.  It's tons of fun.
1188,That sounds so fun! Is it with your friends or how did you find a group to do that with?
1188,"I have always liked acting, and I kind of fell into the group.  We typically go out for pizza afterwards.  Do you like pizza?"
1188,I love pizza. My favorite is extra cheese thick trust from a local pizzeria. What type of tv shows are you into?
1188,"I like sports, but I also love classic movies, like Ben Hur or John Wayne Westerns..  What about you?"

1188,"Totally.  I love the Zombie thing, so much fun.  Do you like soda?  I don't drink a lot, but I love Mountain Dew."
1188,"Yes, Dr Pepper is my fave. We have a local soda here called Ale 8 that is absolutely amazing. Like a mountain dew mixed with ginger ale."
1188,That sounds good.  I like ginger ale too.  Dr. Pepper is also delicious.  Do you play any sports?
1188,"I do ballet, haha that sort of counts, right?"
1188,"Sure does.  That seems hard to me, you need to be flexible and have great balance. I play basketball and golf."
1189,It was just a bird. I'm not sure what it wanted but it was early in the morning.

1204,There are plenty of roads you can take.
1204,I agree. I can also look into going back to graduate school to get a degree in something. 
1204,"Yes, that is a good idea. I am failing some of my classes. I may need to change my plans as well."

1212,"Haha, me too. What's your game of choice? "
1212,I like blackjack and the slots. How about you?
1212,Blackjack is a lot of fun.  I like to drink booze and try to make safe bets. 
1212,Drinking and gambling don't go well together for me. I end up betting too much.
1212,"As long as you drink more than lose, you win, haha.  "

1214,Recycling is one of the best ways for you to have a positive impact on the world in which we live. 
1214,I agree.  I'm not married so I have lots of time to focus on recycling and other environmental causes.
1214,Recycling is important to both the natural environment and us. I'am from California 
1214,"I like California.  I like to sing, so I think I might move out to Hollywood and try to get in movies."
1214,It nice here but the Recycling helps to reduce the pollution caused by waste
1214,I bet it does.  I bet all of the wildfires but the smoke right back in the air though.
1214,Yes it does. Recycling reduces the need for raw materials so that the rainforests can be preserved.
1214,"Yes, I agree.  That's one of the reason I like to recycle.  If I ever get married I'll make sure my wife supports recycling too."
1214,Recycling helps protect the environment. yes that would be good to supports wife on recycling too.

1216,It has wonderful benefits and good pay for about the same type of work that I started off in.
1216,Those are also good reasons to love a job. I hope your sister is enjoying the work.
1216,She is somewhat.  You know how the grass is greener?  While I'm wishing I had her job she said she is envious of my new job.
1216,What is your new job? Sounds like your sister would rather have it instead of her current job.
1216,"Online Consultant.  I mostly help people establish their online operations.  Get noticed on youtube, that sort of thing."
1216,That's sounds like a cool job. My boyfriend has a YouTube channel. May I recommend your services to him?
1216,"Oh sure, I'd be happy to help him.  What sort of videos does he post?"
1216,He posts videos about trading card games and his experiences at events.
1216,"Is he a professional player, or just plays for fun?"
1216,"He plays for fun with his friends and people at events. I live with him in an apartment, but I've never played the game."

1216,"Thank you, he would appreciate it. How much does this service cost?"
1217,German chocolate cake.
1217,I have never tried German Chocolate cake.  We often have cake for birthday office parties but never that type.

1217,I'm like to work with plant.
1217,Sounds like a sweet gig.  What types of plants.

1217,"I love orchids, they are my favorite.  Do you have a green house."
1217,"Yes, pretty much my whole property is all greenhouse."
1217,that's awesome . i'd love to have a greenhouse .
1217,I make a pretty good living propagating all those rare endangered plants.
1217,That must take a lot of knowledge to do.  Did you have to have a lot of schooling.
1218,3 days ago ...very scary ican still feel it
1218,"my boyfriend lives in Italy, snakes come in their houses over there"
1218,awe...are they poisinous..//
1218,not usually just scary and gross
1218,i hate all reptiles..
1218,"I went to visit him once, my hair is really really long and I woke up and there was one on my pillow in my hair!!"
1218,im getting goosebumps reading and thinking of it..!!

1218,hw did you manage taking it off..
1218,very carefully !!!
1218,how did you feel touching it??
1218,"gross, cold, and slimey"
1219,Yeah that was such a nice thing that they did for me.
1219,It surely was.  I work at home editing though so I really don't have any colleagues to do something nice like that for me though.
1219,it will happen. just continue to do good on your job and be respectful and nice to your co-workers. It might just happen.
1219,"Thank you for the support, but I have depression and anxiety so I don t really go out a lot.  That's why I work from home."
1219,"working from home is good too, at least you got a job to fall back on."
1219,That's for sure.  Many people aren't as fortunate.  I try to keep reminding myself of that.
1219,"yes, we have to count our blessings."
1219,I'm hoping the next book I get to edit is about being hopeful in life so that I can learn something while I work.
1219,its always important to learn and grow knowledge.
1219,That is for sure. Maybe someday I will be able to get a job in an office. Nobody seems to want to hire me.
1219,be patient everyone has that special job that will come to them.
1219,I appreciate your support.  Thank you.
1220,Italian food is not really my specialty.

1226,those were hilarious ! i like those and bruce almighty too .
1226,Yeah that was a great one. I remember Liar Liar vividly because we watched it so much growing up. 
1226,I love that movie.  The use of imagery and just simple facial expressions tells so much of the story.
1226,"Yeah I agree, that was his style and he did a great job. People don't really act like that anymore. "
1226,"Comedy has changed, that's for sure. But about Golden Retrievers, I've owned a couple and I've never seen a better family dog. They are so good with kids. "

1227,"Wow, so you were once a man or you grew up/"
1227,I transitioned to female when I was 17 - it wasnt easy but was the right thing to do.

1228,Do you have any hobbies that you do that could distract you a bit?
1228,"Well I like rap music, and I do rap as a hobby but I dont want to do any of that right now"

1228,I like rock too and going out to eat
1228,Cool. Typically I'm into creative kind of stuff. For example I make my own clothes. Sewing can be calming.
1228,I love eating I am not overweight or unhealthy I just love to eat good food

1228,"I love foreign foods like Korean bbq, I love grilling my own meat and eating it"
1228,"I'm going out to lunch later with my dad and trying to decide between Mexican, BBQ and Italian. Which would you pick?"

1245,That's fascinating. I've always been a fan of radiolead. Love their last album.  
1245,I listen to that album at least three times a week. It was so good.
1245,I went to a show of theirs when they were playing at Beacon Theater. People were throwing things up on stage and they had to stop the show.
1245,That is such a shame that the actions of a few have consequences for everyone else.
1245,It was a shame. They drummer was hit in the shin by someone's camera. Looked like a nice camera too.
1245,Wow. Was he hurt? Did you have to call an ambulance? 
1245,Yes. Paramedics were on the scene. It looked like it cut open his leg. The band members were so mad. They walked off within seconds and the crowed started booing.
1245,"Just what you don't need, an unruly mob."
1245,Right?! I left right away. I was so annoyed by the crowd. 
1245,That was probably the safest thing to do.
1245,Yes. Plus I had a flight to catch at 8 in the morning then a late shift to work that night. It wasn't worth sticking around. 
1246,Me too. Especially in theaters where the music and effects are amplified.
1246,Yes! I love going to the theatre. My family likes to go on Christmas!
1246,Oh thats an interesting tradition. I bet it is fun. I can't believe you're looking forward to mission impossible. i dislike that series.
1246,Is it because of Tom Cruise and his weird middle tooth?
1246,Just tome cruise in general. Hes a creep
1246,"Yeah, he's kind of weird."
1246,Did you see Vanilla sky?
1246,I did not! Is it good?
1246,It's weird. Kinda like butterfly effect or Eternal sunshine. It gave me the creeps. What is your favorite action movie?
1246,"I really like action/comedy movies, so something like Spy or Get Smart"
1246,I need to check those out. I prefer comedies but my husband would like me to watch more action movies with him
1246,"Maybe you can compromise and watch one of those, since they are comedy and action!"
1246,Yah great idea. It was nice chatting!
1247,Being a viking the ocean is my home.
1247,That's cool.  I live near the Atlantic ocean and love it.  
1247,It's beautiful but very cold here.  What do you do for a living.
1247,"I'm in construction, what about you?"
1247,Just a viking. Plundering and farming are what I do best.

1247,"Yes I love to fish.  I also like to hike, keeps me young."

1247,True.  Do you like eating pizza?  I like a good pepperoni pizza.
1247,"No, I do not like pizza.  I just like plain norwegian foods."

1248,"I play soccer, I am a goalie"
1248,What team do you play?  What league?
1248,"oh nothing special, just a local team, do you like soccer?"
1248,Yes I think it is a very interesting sport-lots of strategy
1248,"yes it is interesting, and difficult to play, what do you do?"
1248,I play Hockey-I am a defenseman
1248,"cool, I got hit by a hockey puck once as a kid, right in the face, i havent watched a hockey game since"

1248,I listen to classic rock music usually-how about you?
1249,she must be pretty famous
1249,"Yeah, she inspired me to get into fashion when I was little"
1249,what type of fashion are you into?
1249,I like minimalist fashion. I'm interested in textures and shapes
1249,that must require a special eye for detail
1249,It does! I'm still working on honing mine. Is there a kind of fashion you like?
1249,"it's all the same to me, i'm very unfashionable"
1249,I think anyone can be fashionable pretty easily
1249,"i suppose you are right, depends on the individual themself"
1249,It doesn't really take too much. A few small changes are enough to transform anyone
1249,sounds like i need some tips from you
1249,I'd be happy to give some
1250,"Thats cool, what other interests do you have? I personally love cars "
1250,I know very little about cars but my husband is a chevy fanatic. he has two project cars in his shop right now. 
1250,"Thats cool maybe I can chat with him some time, cars are my passion Im a mustang guy, I drive a restored mustang in fact"
1250,very cool. what year?
1250,"A 95 Mustang, it used to be my dads it took a lot of effort and work especially because Im in college and time is something I dont have"
1250,my husband has a 78 mustang but it is not in driving conditions. 
1250,Thats a really cool model 78 is one of the best is he planning to restore it?
1250,That is the plan - as money and time allows. It is not a cheap hobby lol
1250,"It is not lol, restoring mine almost cost me a liver that and paying for college, it was worth it though"
1250,All worth it. I suppose I will change my tune when I can finally drive around with him in one of these projects
1250,"Yeah when the car is done things will be different, hope that day comes soon "
1250,one day for sure . what else do you like ?
1251,That seems like a nice place. Do you have beaches there? I enjoy swimming a lot.
1251,Yes we have beaches but it's cold because we are so far north
1251,Oh I see. What do you do for fun?
1251,I like to go hiking in the forest. 
1251,That sounds like fun! I like to stay indoors mostly. I sew a lot.
1251,My mother used to sew until she got arthritis in her hands.
1251,What types of sewing projects did she like?
1251,She would take patterns and make pictures out of them. 
1251,How creative! I enjoy quilting.
1251,I have never quilted but I always thought it looked fun. Maybe I could make a square with my favorite food lutefisk.
1251,That would be interesting. It has been nice chatting with you today!

1252,"lol, fried chicken.. Im vegan because of climate change, do you believe in climate change"
1252,"I dont, not at all. I understand being a vegan, but I couldent live without fried chicken for dinner"
1252,"understandable, but climate change is real, you can see it all around the world, hurricanes are becoming more frequent, fires are spreading all the time "
1252," if you actually look at all of the statistics the earth is cooler now then it was in the 1900's, and the storms etc are not stronger or weaker"
1252,"oh cool, but what about the fires and especially in the amazon and California "
1252,"there has always been flooding, not just in the south, most of the fires statistically are started by man"
1253,It's a 2018 Bentley Bentayga. It was a birthday gift.
1253,Wow.  That's a nice ride.  What do you do for a living?
1253,I'm at artist. I work at a local art shop selling and making various art pieces. What about you?
1253,I work as a CPA for a large firm.  What kind of art do you do?
1253,I make pottery. Mostly with clay and other ceramic materials. My latest project was making a dishware set for some newlyweds. 
1253,That's interesting. You must be very talented
1253,"I'd like to think so. I receive lots of comments on my work. I have a showcase coming up this weekend, I'm pretty excited about it."
1253,Where is your showcase happening?
1253,"It's going to be downtown Austin, TX if you're in the area. It's at a small art shop off of 5th street."
1253,I know the area well.  I used to live not far from there.
1253,"That's awesome. I love walking around the city. In fact, that's all I do is walk. It's my favorite activity outside of work."
1253,There are some really nice parks and walking trails in Austin.
1254,"Believe it or not, it was during the Democratic debate!  "
1254,Why did they eat a squid during the debate?
1254,"I'm not sure, but there was a robot that went crazy afterwards."
1254,The giant squid belongs to the genus Architeuthis. I love deep sea diving.
1254,That's impressive information!  I'm more into robotics than diving.
1254,"Robots scare me but are interesting. I also love party planning, it's my job."
1254,"I wonder, would you be willing to plan a party for robots?  Maybe that would ease your mind about them?"
1254,"Honestly, I wouldn't mind it. LOL"
1254,Just as long as we don't invite the squid eating people!  LOL
1254,"Yeah, they definitely wouldn't sing about the Watergate scandal!"
1254,"Or worse yet, they might!!"
1254,I think I will deep sea dive to catch some squid to serve! Do robots like squid?
1255,He is really sweet I just loved the effort he put into the gift 
1255,kid gifts are the greatest! What color hair do you have
1255,"Yeah they sure are, my hair is brown so what hobbies do you have? "
1255,"i have brown hair too, I like to eat a lot of healthy food"
1255,"I like salads but also love junk food, I also love swimming interesting fact but I can jump straight out of a pool, I can jump really high "
1255,that's amazing ! i am not sure if i could do that
1255,"You should give it a try, so what about political inclinations? Republican or Democrat?"
1255,I am honestly not a fan. I am a Republican myself. How about you?
1255,"I guess we are on opposing sides, I am a Democrat but I don't take politics that seriously "
1255,"that's sad, you should take it seriously, politics are important, although I just dont agree with the free lifestyles liberals are after"
1255,"They are but many politicians are a joke and I rather take importance in other matters, life is just too short "
1255,"you should be a liberatarian then, they are middle of the road, and yes life is short, too short"
1256,I love traveling! Once I stay situated I'll get a few more cats.
1256,"That's a good idea. You could adopt from PetSmart. I did, and it only cost me 15 bucks!"
1256,"Wow that's cheap, I should consider that. Do you have any hobbies?"
1256,I love to cook. This time of year I love to make stews.
1256,"Nice, what kind of stews do you make?"
1256,Mostly stews with beef or chicken and lots of vegetables. I also like making homemade pasta.
1256,I love pasta especially pasta carbonara.
1256,"I like carbonara as well!  The bacon, egg, and cheese sure play well with pasta."
1256,"They certainly do, many people seem to disagree on what should go in the dish."
1256,Really? I have not heard of too many variations. What are the differences?
1256,"Supposedly the original dish has panchetta instead of bacon, but I like bacon."
1256,"Oh, yes, now that you mention it. I think some people put a bit of wine in it too. "
1257,It's unfortunate. I had to take time off from work.
1257,I am sorry for your loss. How are you now?
1257,Doing a lot better. Thank you for asking. Getting back in the flow of work has helped a lot. Time off was stressful. 
1257,I can only imagine. I'd say it was hard getting back in the swing of things once you got back.
1257,"Well, I work as a zookeeper so it's actually nice interacting with the animals. If it were people it would be another story."
1257,I bet you never have a dull moment at work.
1257,My wife has been great support. We work at the same zoo. What do you do for work?
1257,I bet that does help. I work as in a warehouse. A lot less exciting as yours. 
1257,That's interesting. Do you enjoy what you do?
1257,Sometimes. Don't have to worry about too much human interaction
1257,For sure. I've worked in customer service before. It's was not fun for me at all.
1257,Yes. I worked at a call center once. Worst experience of my life.
1258,yes
1258,That's good. It would be embarassing at work.
1258,yes its very much embarassing 
1258,Might've been something you ate. I wouldn't eat that again.
1258,yea i think everyone should follow this. 
1258,Don't quit eating all together!
1258,yes. its very important 
1258,"That event would probably never happen again in a million years, so enjoy your food!"
1258,"yea its very important to enjoy. we have to enjoy it, "
1258,What is your favorite meal when you eat out?
1258,i think i like to eat chicken fry 
1258,With mashed potatoes and gravy and fried okra?
1259,Yes I still play it but it isn't as good as I hoped for.
1259,"If I remember correctly, I wasn't fond of being Mario himself.  Did you beat the first Mario, too?"
1259,"Of course, I beat all the original Mario games."
1259,"Oh cool - I haven't played all of them, but did playthe first one."
1259,"Yeah I enjoyed those when I was young, I was born in the 80s so Nintendo was like the only thing around back then."
1259,"I remember the 64.  That was the last console to use cartridges.  I first began playing on an Atari, lol."
1259,"Yeah Atari was before my time, haha. I did play Pong I think but at an arcade."
1259,"Pong! I played Pong as well. I need to play it soon, I just don't have much time with being a baseball player."
1259,"as an adult it is hard to find time to game for sure, I usually just end up playing whatever my kids play."
1259,What do your kids play? Mine play cricket mostly.
1259,Actually my daughter loves the cat mario game on wii and my son plays fortnite a lot.
1260,Haha! What is your favorite brand of alcohol?
1260,"I like Vodka, but mixed with stuff to kill the taste, I hate beer though, it is nasty to me"
1260,Same with me. Alcohol usually has a nasty taste to me. Are you in school right now?
1260,"No, I recently graduated. I managed to get a good job that allows me to afford my condo"
1260,Oh well congratulations! I'm in nursing school right now. 
1260,That's awesome! Are you enjoying it.
1260,Yes very much! I can't wait until I finish it though. It has been a lot of hard work so far.
1260,That's understandable. Why did you decide to go to nursing school?
1260,I just have a lot of compassion and enjoy bringing comfort to those who are in pain. 
1260,That's nice. I am sure you'll be a fantastic nurse. 
1260,Thank you! What is your job?
1260,I work as a free lance software developer. I help companies build websites and mobile applications.

1261,"Civil War as well as Renaissance, and what about you?"
1261,"Civil War as well, but I love watching about any "
1261,It really excites me and I love to see people really get into their characters. I love when they shoot off the cannons!
1261,Yes. That adds to the realism of it. 
1261,What other hobbies do you enjoy doing?
1261,One of my biggest hobbies is that I love collecting dolls. 
1261,That sounds really neat!!! Do you have any favorites? My hobby is I like to show up at news tapings so I can go on the news.
1261,It is hard to narrow down my favorite. I think I just like the collecting aspect of it. 
1261,Oh okay. I love the old porcelain dolls even though they creep me out.
1261,"LOL, I guess they weren't so precious after all.  I used to love those things."

1263,"That does sound fun, must need a lot of bug spray though."
1263,"Oh yeah, the mosquitoes in Florida in the summer are the size of small birds.  Some people really attract them.  I know I do.  How about you?"
1263,I sure do. When I turn 18 I might go to school in ft. myers.
1263,I am sure they have lots of parks and theaters there.  You will like it.
1263,"Yes, I think so. I'm only 15 now so there is so much to look forward to."

1265,"I heard about Ghost, they got great songs. They're touring right now"
1265,You should try to see them. They are great in concert.
1265,I should. 
1265,I saw them last year with my dance partner. We had the best time.

1265,I hope they do! What else are you into?
1265,"Before I sleep, I read autobiographies"
1265,I love to read before bed. I often fall asleep reading though.  Any book recommendations?
1265,The outsider by Stephen King is pretty good.
1265,"I'll have to look into that. Thanks for the reccomendation ! Ugh, did I spell that right?"
1265,Close enough.
1265,"Sorry, lol, either way, thanks. You have a great day or night or whatever it is!"
1265,you too!
1266,Only on television!
1266,They broadcast a lot of surfing competitions on television!
1266,"I'd like to learn more about that, I don't even know how surfing is scored. It looks so difficult! Are you good at it?"
1266,"I think so, I like to go surfing every morning."
1266,Was it hard to learn? I'm not a very good swimmer so I don't think I would even try.
1266,"Yeah, it definitely requires skill and balance! You have to ride on the face of the wave which then carries you towards the shoreline."
1266,That sounds so scary! I think I will just stay on dry land lol. What else do you like to do?
1266,I also like to cook
1266,I love to cook and also bake! What's your favorite dish to prepare?
1266,Lasagna and lots and lots of garlic bread
1266,Pasta is the BEST! I like fettuccine alfredo with lots of garlic bread! And maybe a slice of cheesecake for dessert.
1266,"that sounds pretty good, I'll have to try that later!"
1267,That is my nature.I blame others for my problems
1267,That's terrible..
1267,I know! Tha is something I need to deal with
1267,Are you seeking any type of therapy?
1267,"Yes, behavioral therapy. Even when i know it is my fault, I blame others"
1267,"Well, hopefully you will have a breakthrough soon"
1267,I hope soo.
1267,"My dad had the same problem, its why my parents got divorced"
1267,I tried to compaste that by always buying the beer when I am at a bar with friends
1267,What? That makes no sense.
1267,"you know, trying to be a good friend to those I out blame for my errors"
1267,"Oh, I see."
1268,"Yes, I did.  I find that it's best to stand up for yourself immediately instead of letting a problem fester.  Don't you agree?"
1268,Yes. Otherwise you will second guess yourself and wish you would have did something.
1268,There was a blood moon when I was born. That might be why I am the way I am.
1268,THe way you are?
1268,I mean that I will confront people who bully me immediately.  Do you believe in astrology?
1268,"I am not sure. I never have looked into it. I do know I am a Gemini, but that is as far has I have went. How about you?"

1268,What are some of the odd jobs you have worked?

1269,"Oh I love football, it is my favorite. I love music just as much, I listen to metal. What about you?"
1269,"Yes, I love metal. I don't understand football but it's good you enjoy it."
1269,What are some of your favorite bands to listen to?
1269,"Well, I like Slayer and I like some old school punk as well, like the plasmatics. "
1269,"Slayer is one of my favorites, all my old military buddies introduced me to them. I also love Cannibal Corpse."
1269,"Yeah, I like CC. So you were in the military?"
1269,"I was in the Navy for 15 years, what about yourself?"
1269,"Wow. no, I never served. I thought about but it's probably good I didn't. I would probably not have fit in very well. "
1269,"That's okay, not everyone needs to serve in my eyes. It was hard work and harder to readjust to life. But my music definitely helps!"
1269,"Yes, music is a good outlet for me. I like to sing. "
1269,What is your favorite song you like to sing?
1269,"the first song that came to mind has a somewhat explicit title, haha. "
1270,i like to take dogs 
1270,What kind of dogs do you have
1270,asian dogs i have. they are very cute. do you have any?
1270,"No, I have 3 horses though."
1270,"wow.. horses, nice.  how much money it take to buy these horses"
1270,Its negotiable!
1270,ok nice. do you have any birds?
1270,no . . . i'd like a bird though
1271,Sounds like you are doing good for yourself. 
1271,"I'm trying hard, thank you."
1271,I would enjoy owning a house on the beach. 
1271,"Yeah, that sounds so peaceful. My home is in the mountains. But I love the beach as well."
1271,I have a lotof family that live near mountains. It's always fun to visit and enjoy the scenery
1271,I really love the winters. Can't beat the fireplace. But snowball fights are fun too! Where do you live now?
1271,"In normal suburbs. Mountains few hours to the West, beaches a few hours to the East. "
1271,"Well, you seem to have a place for whatever mood strikes! Great! Another subject..do you enjoy any sports?"
1271,I enjoy college football the most. 
1271,"I enjoy football as well, but, I really love baseball. I'm caught up in the World Series right now."
1271,I like baseball too
1271,It's been great talking. I hope you have a great evening. I'm going to put a pizza in the oven. My favorite! Goodbye.
1272,Oh the noises don't really bother me.  you get used to it.  I prefer the night even.
1272,I am a night person also! I think that's  why so many of my romantic relationships have ended poorly! lol
1272,"Oh no, sorry to hear that.  I have had a lot of failed relationships too.  What usually happens?"
1272,I like to go out too much and have fun. I guess I'm not ready to settle down!
1272,Same here - I have women calling me all the time in fact.  There are just too many choices!
1272,I hear you! I'm a full-time college student and still too many choices out there!
1272,At some point you have to settle down though.  It is a more satisfying life if you can meet one person.
1272,I know.....Right now I'm trying to be more serious about school instead of women!
1272,That's a good plan.  You have to focus on the right things at each stage in life.
1272,Are you married?
1272,"Yes, I am. But I'm much older than you.  My college days are long gone."
1272,"I hope to settle down one day and have a great wife, marriage & a few kids! Dog too!"
1273,"That's true, but sometimes they don't get the history exactly right in order for it to be really educational."
1273,a very good point ! what else do you like to do in your spare time ?
1273,I like hiking and listening to music.
1273,That sounds like a good way to have fun and get some exercise!
1273,It is and I can do both of those at the same time which is nice.
1273,I haven't been hiking in a long time.  I used to go with my dad a lot.
1273,"Are you close with your family? Mine doesn't like the things I do, like One Direction. They hate One Direction."
1273,"I am close to them, but live far from them.  I wish I could spend more time with them."
1273,"That is sweet, I bet they miss you also!"
1273,They do.  Hopefully we will be able to move closer to them.
1273,What kind of music do you listen to? 
1273,I listen to all kinds.  I recently discovered Metalachi so I have been listening to that today.
1274,"I do! I go to techno shows when I can get some time off from my jobs, I work at Target and Mcdonalds and Uber. Do you like techno?"
1274,love techno music its a banger. I can't get enough of it!
1274,What is your favorite techno artist?
1274,I'm not picky at all. I like them all. I have been listening to techno since in 1988.
1274,"Oh nice, I miss techno from the 90's so much. It was so carefree, I wish society could go back a bit."
1274,yes it was and i too like simpler times . what about tv shows...do you like anime ?
1274,"I haven't watched much anime, could you recommend a show to watch? I love Gilligans Island, and The Munsters."
1274,"Even though I love anime and i stopped watching tv a few years ago, maybe I shall return. I love the Munsters."
1274,The Munsters are so much fun! I love creepiness.
1274,"Yes, i like that too . there's some scary stuff in those shows ."
1274,Do you have any other favorite shows you like to watch>
1274,"i do not really have a favorite . i just really like listening to techno music. Though, I could recommend the Golden Girls"
1275,I really miss my parents
1275,I lost my mother last year. She helped me create a rose garden
1275,What a lovely thing to remember her by.  What was she like?
1275,She was an amazing woman. She gave me a green thumb
1275,I can't seem to grow any kind of plants myself.
1275,I probably couldn't have if it wasn't for her starting it. 
1275,My mother was a teller at a bank.  I don't really have much to remember her by.
1275,what was she like?
1275,"I was so young when she passed, but I've been told she was very kind to strangers."
1275,"Awe, I am so sorry to hear that. "
1275,I wish I had been able to have more time with her.
1275,I wish you would have too. I was lucky to have a few years with her. 
1276,Yes many peple

1276,Me too
1276,what games are you looking of buying soon ?

1276,one day i'll have enough money for something
1277,Me too! I'll try and get good sleep tonight. Anything to help!
1277,"I might try yoga tonight to help me sleep, do you like yoga?"
1277,"Actually, I have always wanted to practice it. I just have never started. "
1277,Yoga is low impact. They have classes for all ages and levels. It will be a reason to get up and help you stay healthy longer.
1277,I certainly need that. It might help with my worry over speaking in public. 
1277,"Oh no, that may help out a lot! It will help center and balance you, I have social anxiety so I understand. "
1277,"I am a vegetarian though, I believe that also helps me to be healthy and keep my mind clear. Do you ever have to speak in public?"
1277,"I do, when I sell my jewelry that I make. It is rough but manageable. I want to try being vegetarian, is it hard?"
1277,It was at first. I'm not actually opposed to meat or dairy but I found many foods I enjoy and that helped a lot. So now it comes easy. 
1277,I will have to try it. Do you eat soy?
1277,"No, I have trouble with it. I noticed you sell jewelry what kind?"
1277,I like to make dreamcatcher jewelry as well as Bible markers since it is my favorite book.
1277,Nice. Have a great evening!
1278,Yeah Correct
1278,Yeah. Have you ever been to Jacksonville? It's the most populous muncipality in the state and largest city in the US.
1278,acksonville is a large city in northeastern Florida where the St. John’s River meets the Atlantic Ocean.

1310,That is smart. Sugar is tasty but it has nothing good for a body.
1310,"Yes, and diabetes runs in my family."

1314,"Wow, sounds like you are at the husband buffet!"
1314,Funny! But yeah I guess that fits! Do you have a special seafood place?
1314,Not now.  I used to live on the coast where seafood was a lot better.  How about you?

1340,which do you prefer
1341,Oh I understand that. I work on cars for a living so I can relate. 
1341,"i wish i was good at mechanics , those bills are high !"
1342,Really? I like pickles; they make for a great snack sometimes. 
1342,I eat pickles with spaghetti
1342,"Wow, that's an interesting combination! I'd be willing to try it."
1342,"My husband makes spaghetti sauce from scratch, but not with pickles "
1342,Spaghetti sauce from scratch is the best! I like to pair my spaghetti with cheesy garlic bread. 
1342,Garlic bread is my favorite but I like to add a lot of parmesan cheese
1342,I like parmesan cheese too! I like to buy the fresh kind that you have to grate. It is so flavorful!
1342,"I would love to go to Italy, the food there must be awesome!"
1342,I bet! I have Italy on my bucket list. I've heard the food is delicious there.
1342,Well it seems like a place everyone should check out!
1342,I agree! What other places would you like to visit?
1342,I would love to go to Switzerland. I'm a travel agent and there are a lot of places on my bucket list.
1343,It's been this way for some time now.
1343,"if it's been going on for so long, why do you think that is?"
1343,Sadness has always been a part of my family.
1343,Sorry to hear about that. But why does sadness prevent others from not listening to you?
1343,"I guess it's my fault.  I don't expect folks to listen, so I don't try hard enough to make a point."
1343,"But I'm listening to you right now, even though I don't have to!"
1343,Yes.  But it's hard to share my feelings.  Because I don't believe anyone cares.  And I drink a lot.
1343,Do you think you have a drinking problem?
1343,I don't.  It's not everyday.  It happened after I lost someone I loved.
1343,sorry to hear about that. Was it a family member or a person in a relationship or a friend?
1343,Relationship.  Now I have my doubts about love.  It's not real.
1343,"Well, don't feel guilty over feeling this way. You can't help your emotions."
1344,Haha thats interesting! Hockey is my most favorite sport
1344,"i like hockey also, but it is not my favorite sport."
1344,What is your favorite?
1344,my favorite sport is football.
1344,Oh neato! I love a good football game too
1344,"Yes, I love it more than any other sport."
1344,Haha whats your favorite football snack?
1344,french fries or a hamburger
1344,For me im not picky anything will do as long as it dosent have sugar in it
1344,i love to eat sugar on my meals. it is delicious.
1344,Lucky because of health problems im forced to avoid it
1344,yeah that would be tough . i have had good luck with my health .
1345,a perk of my job
1345,That sounds awesome. I wish I could take a day off. 
1345,oh wow you need some time to relax what is your job like 
1345,I just started a small business. 
1345,oh wow small businesses are a big job to do so i understand why you haven't been off well maybe soon you will have a break
1345,I hope so but I understand why I can't yet.

1345,"No, but I want to. It looks so beautiful."
1345,me too never been yet. my job is busy i am up 4am everday how about you?
1345,I work really long hours now but I hope as things get going I will have to work less hours.
1345,yes i understand the long hours are hard on me too
1345,But hey who knows maybe in the future we will be able to go vacationing to Canada.
1346,too bad I cannot take the dogs.  I have two of them
1346,"yeah, i get it. no pool boys but lifeguards can still be quite a snack."
1346,"lol. ok, maybe he can meet my pitbull or old english bulldog "
1346,i myself have a bulldog love the little buggers. 
1346,want to move to the country to have more space. love the country
1346,where to though?
1346,"out in the sticks.  city life is enjoyable, but just for a visit"
1346,"yeah, the hustle and bustle can be overwhelming but i like where i am. i tend to try to convince myself to stay here tho."
1346,"yeah, convenience can be persuasive "
1346,not as persuasive as that vision of a pool boy next door though loool.
1346,lol... 
1346,"i'm not even a fan of going to pools, too dirty. Just him."
1347,"I am from Texas lots of cars everywhere ,pretty crowded"
1347,I love Texas.
1347,I never learned how to drive but love to see the country when traveling thru the country
1347,I love driving
1347,oh really what do you do for fun?
1347,"i drive in the country an just have fun , you ?"
1347,"well scratching my nose,watching films,going out like everyone else."
1347,That's not a bad way to spend your day.  That can be just as fun if you get the right kind of movies.
1347,that is true I really like watching horror movies and like a good one to scare me.
1347,i love a good suspense too !
1347,good any favorite films that you love to watch?
1347,i like anything to do with mystery
1348,I bought her a drink
1348,Are you going to see her again?
1348,Most likely not. I am married but it feels good to be hit on.
1348,I don't know if I'll ever get married. My brother won't stop sleeping on my couch. 
1348,"haha, well maybe your young but its like always being with your best friend."
1348,"That's true, we have fun together. "
1348,"Yeah, my brother lives about 3 hours away. I wish he lived closer."
1348,Do you get to visit him often?
1348,Not really maybe twice a year.
1349,"Yes, it's very challenging work but I love to learn new things and be handy."
1349,That is a good skill set to have. 
1349,"Yes, unfortunately I am unemployed right now so maybe not the best. Do you work?"
1349,I work from home as a freelancer. I like multitasking and having flexibility in my schedule. 
1349,Yes that's something that is very important to me now. I might become a nomad. 
1349,That sounds awesome! Would you travel by RV or another method?
1349,I may go the minimalist route and drive by motorcycle only. Wanna join?
1349,"Everything in me loves the idea of that adventure, but I have kiddos at home"
1349,"Yes of course, you must be a responsible parent. Maybe someday I will achieve that."
1349,Kids are an awesome adventure and will happen for you when it is meant to
1349,Yes I can't wait to be a father. However my ex-wife wishes impotence on me every day!
1349,Exs can be bitter like that but we do not have to be chained by their own misery
1350,"that's ok, I didn't like being a banker. I want to be a park ranger actually"
1350,"well i hope you get the job! i love being in my field, i frequently get to go to paris! oh how i love it there."
1350,"that's great, what do you like about Paris?"
1350,"The people, the atmosphere, oh its just so romantic i tell you. The local girls tend to like me too, being over 6 feet tall has its perks."
1350,do you speak French?
1350,"Oui, haha yes it is one of a few languages i speak."
1350,what others do you speak?
1350,"I'm fluent in Japanese, German, english and russian."
1350,Which language do you speak the best?
1350,well i try to shop myself out there for my french skills. i have a bias towards getting hired to work abroad in france. Mainly in paris.
1350,"I hope you get the chance to work there, good luck!"
1350,oh and i hope you get yours too dear.

1351,Orange but I also like white sometimes.
1351,whats your favorite music genre?
1351,I love pop music and listening to oldies. How about you?
1351,Yep same here pop music is best . My parents who are both teachers raised me on it
1351,Do you have a favorite artist?
1351,No absolute favorites! I just like a ton of artists!
1351,It is difficult to pick just one. There are so many great ones.
1351,Thats true! And more and more coming out every year!
1351,"Yes, and they keep getting younger. It makes me feel old."
1351,Haha im right there with you but it cant be helped lol
1351,That is true. I guess I am just glad that I don't think all new music is garbage.

1353,"I agree, I am more of an iphone person myself. "
1353,I phone is just as good as a samsung galaxy. I like using both.
1353,"I agree, they are both great. I just prefer the iphone interface more."
1353,"we all have our differences in phones, i like the samsung better."
1353,what makes you like samsung better?
1353,Androids for some reason hold more capacity and are faster then Iphones
1353,"Well android is really just an OS, there are many brands that use android for the OS."
1353,i realize that. Just like Google does.
1353,Are you afraid of privacy with google collecting everything you do?
1353,not too concerned because i am careful what what I post.
1353,Posting is public knowledge. I mean what you do on the phone.
1354,I don't sleep anyway with all the caffeine I drink
1354,The caffeine helps with running for me :D
1354,It helps keep me focused on work/school
1354,That's a good use for it for sure!
1354,how're you doing tonight
1354,Okay I'm kinda bored though :/
1354,lol I feel that...just killing time
1354,SAME it's like this most nights i need a hobby lol :p
1354,lol I'm trying to quit juuling but when I'm just at home bored on the computer is when I want it just because I'm not doing anything else
1354,Ah that's harsh is it like smoking? I use to vape but no nicotine 
1354,yeah juul is a type of vape but it's nicotine 
1354,Ohhh okay i don't really know much about the newer stuff. My vape is old
1355,i would like that. how often do you go?
1355,I am usualy there at least once a week. I just luv it!
1355,I love animals I always have
1355,"We have quite a few at the shelter, but not as many reptiles as I woud like."
1355,do you have a favorite animal there?
1355,I did. His name was Roscoe. He got adopted last week to a wonderful family!
1355,that is awesome
1355,"Yeah, he was great. I kinda miss him, but we are always getting new friends down there."
1355,i imagine so many animals need good homes
1355,"Oh, absolutely. I wonder if people realize how many of them are needing homes!"
1355,"Idk, in my apt complex there are so many strays its sad"
1355,"Yeah, there are a lot of them where I live to. Do you ever feed them just because nobody else will?"
1356,I work from home as a freelancer while I take care of my kiddos. 
1356,Gotcha same here. It is great since I can do my favorite hobby!
1356,Awesome! What is your favorite hobby?
1356,"I love cooking. So, as it is a chore to others I actually enjoy it!"
1356,Oh neat. I am learning how to do more cooking. Videos and books have been helpful
1356,Yes. Youtube has been a life send for sure!
1356,"My mom was not the biggest fan, so she didn't teach me much but now I am learning that it can be fun"
1356,Oh that does make it harder on you for sure. My mom loved cooking too.
1356,That is great. Do you have a good relationship with your mom? I talk to mine every day
1356,Yes!! cooking has helped us bond when I was growing up. I am like you and we talk everyday too.
1356,I hope my kids want to talk to me frequently when they are grown. Maybe cooking will help us with that as well
1356,"I have worried about that, But it all depends on what they actually enjoy doing. "
1356,Good point. I will figure that out as my kiddos get older
1356,It will be interesting to see what kind of people they grow up to become.
1356,Indeed. Have a good night. 
1356,You yoo!!
1357,I'm really glad hitchhiking is free and popular because I really enjoy it. It offers me a chance to talk to other people from around the country.
1357,its nice talking to people from other areas of the world .
1357,"Yea, I especially enjoy it since I live alone and don't really have anyone to interact with on a daily basis."
1357,"I don't have many friends myself, so I'm always looking for opportunities to make new friends."
1357,"Yup me too. When I'm hitchhiking and in the car with another person, I usually start talking about philosophical stuff like the meaning of existence."
1357,i've never been able to wrap my head around philosophy .
1357,Oh? what topic do you enjoy discussing then?
1357,I'm an avid hunter.  I love being able to find my own food.
1357,"I understand hunters who hunt for food. However, I never understand people who under for ""fun"" or for ""sport"". Do you hunt for ""fun"" and not for food?"
1357,I'm an outdoorsman.  I hunt or fish for half of the meat I eat each year.
1357,"Yup eating fresh food that you catch yourself makes sense. Do you hunt for ""fun"" though?"
1357,"Nope, I only hunt for food."
1358,yes i was i am an only child so it was exciting
1358,Thats great! kids can be alot of fuj
1358,yes so much fun they bring alot of happiness 
1358,"They are alot of hard work though, "
1358,yes do you have any 
1358,yes i have a 8month old
1358,oh awesome they are so amazing
1358,indeed my daughter has decided she hates naps lol
1358,oh wow lol that stinks they need those naps for sure or they are grumps 
1358,yes that is very true
1358,do you travel
1358,yes we have a big trip planned for christmas you?
1358,oh fun we have travel to europe and mexico it was a blast 
1359,"That sounds rough, what was it like?"
1359,I must admit it was very crumped. It was a low point in my life.
1359,I lived in a place like that once. I sacrificed space to live near the beach.
1359,yeah it can be rough sometime. especially considering the fact that I once was was in a show but I wasn't lucky even then...
1359,Wow! Can you tell me about the show?
1359,"oh sure, it was Jeopardy"
1359,How did you do?
1359,"well, considering that I ended up living in a storage locker for two months I'd say not very good. but that's life you know... how about yourself?"
1359,"I'm living the beach bum lifestyle these days. Hang out by the beach, reading. I make sure to surf at least once a week."
1359,"actually that sounds liberating! I might move to the beach one day - maybe if I do you can ""show me the ropes""?"
1359,"For sure! I'm still new to the area, but I've found a few great spots. I didn't know you were interested in surfing."
1359,I hear surfing can be tricky but once you get the hang of it it is exhilarating!
1360,They sound pretty lame
1360,They are similar to other Pop punk bands such as blink 182 and Fall Out Boy
1360,are they similar to One Direction
1360,I do know them as well. What is your favorite group?
1360,Avenged Sevenfold
1360,Ok. Do like surfing?
1360,"Never tried it, seems fun though. Do you? "
1360,Yes. I defiantly do. That is a lot of fun. I am doing that with my wife. 
1360,oh cool I just recently got engaged
1360,That is great. I have been married for 10 years now to my high school sweetheart 
1360,That's awesome hope I can say the same in a few years
1360,"Yes, indeed. By the way are you from New York?"
1361,Wouldn't you get in trouble with the law for doing that?
1361,"I think it ultimately depends on whether or not we get caught, and if we are being careful."
1361,"Well, no offense, but that just doesn't seem very sanitary at all, haha. Can you tell me more about what a garbage plate is?"
1361,"A garbage plate is a local north eastern delicacy. I could tell you more, but you must be initiated."
1361,"Maybe it's for the best that I don't know, it sounds messy and I hate cleaning up."
1361,"So does my wife, so I have become the unofficial garbage man."
1361,"Hah, that's unfortunate. I have to do all the cleaning for myself, wish I had someone to do it for me."
1361,I am getting a divorce soon. Maybe we can meet up at the local dump? And discuss our garbage troubles? 
1361,"I'm afraid I'll have to politely decline, but good luck with your divorce. Hopefully that situation doesn't turn into a garbage plate!"
1361,Yes my life is going down in the dumps just like the Bills season. Oh well. There is always more beer.
1361,"Well, I'd tell you not to be so blue about it, but unfortunately blue is my favorite color, so sadly I don't think I can help you there."
1361,My favorite color is green. 
1362,They are going to name him John.
1362,I had a friend named john. I used to cook for him.
1362,What kind of food do you like to cook?
1362,Chinese is fun to cook bourbon chicken. I love italian too :D
1362,Oh I love Chinese food so much. I tend to eat too much fast food though. 
1362,I feel you on that fast food is addictive!
1362,I drive out in my passat and get fast food at least once a day. 
1362,Where do you usually go? i like pizza a lot.
1362,I like to frequent Chinese buffets. They are my weak spot. 
1362,Last time i was at the buffet i went crazy. LOL!
1362,Same here! I love going to Hibachi buffets. I could sit there for hours. 
1362,There's one i went to like 3 weeks ago. So good!
1363,not sure what you mean but I sure do love cats
1363,i am more of a dog person
1363,dogs are cool too!
1363,how many cats do you have
1363,"just one, no room where I stay now"
1363,"i understand, we are not allowed to have pets"
1363,"oh, I know that problem but now that I moved back to my parents house I can allow myself a pet"
1363,that is cool. we will get a pet when we move hopefully soon!
1363,"sounds good! my pet stays at my room, it's in the basement but pretty comfy"
1363,thats neat basement apartments can be really neat
1363,yeah! kinda of a man cave only downside is it's my parents house but it is what is eh?
1363,hey you have somewhere to live thats what matters
1364,"Yes, it absolutely puts me to sleep."
1364,Do you live in a place where it regularly rains?
1364,I live in Mississippi and it rains a lot here at certain times of the year. What about you?
1364,"I'm in tennessee, and it's hot and humid."
1364,Here too. You live with family? I live alone right now.
1364,I have a small family with 2 kids and some pets.
1364,That sounds nice. I've just always preferred to live alone I guess. 
1364,I suppose there is a balance of quiet and the company of others.
1364,True. What do you do for fun?
1364,"Well I work, but also love watching TV - its my quiet time."
1364,"I like tv too, but love going to the movies, even though I usually go alone. "
1364,Me too!  What is your favorite movie?
1365,"that's terrible, you don't have anyone to turn to?"
1365,"No, not really. I just sit on the computer all night"
1365,what do you do in the day time?
1365,"I stay home and watch TV mainly, Its pretty boring"
1365,don't you have any friends?
1365,"no not really, thats part of the problem"
1365,"do you have a job, go to school?"
1365,I have a job and I work from home. That keeps me from meeting people 
1365,what do you do for work?
1365,"I work in IT doing data entry, What do you do?"
1365,writer
1365,that sounds like a lucrative career
1366,I never pass up a chance to go to Olive Garden. Their salad is awesome!
1366,I don’t think Olive Garden is a good representation of Italian food
1366,Probably not but I still love it. My adoptive family is Italian and they say the same thing. Nothing like authentic cuisine.
1366,Olive Garden is an Americanized type of Italian food.
1366,Someone is grumpy! Did you not eat to today and it's making you cranky?!
1366,"No, not hungry, just stating fact.  Have your ever visited Italy?"
1366,"No, but I would love to someday, if I could get past the idea of a plane ride."
1366,I would love to go someday.  I just can’t afford it right now.
1366,Well hopefully you will get to visit in the near future. All that history and Italian food!!
1366,"I’m like you, the plane traveling and logistics kind turns me off to traveling there."
1366,Maybe if we could ensure we slept the whole flight....maybe some dramamine. I probably spelled that wrong.
1366,"Lol, isn’t that the truth.  Ambien script, here I come."
1367,Have you tried water skiiing before
1367,"I water ski all the time, do you like water activities?"
1367,"Yes, I like the thought of them. It's just that I'm scared when I actually have to do them"
1367,can you swim?
1367,"Yes, as long as I am wearing my red bathing suit. Red things calm me down"
1367,do you ever go to the beach?
1367,"I like the beach some, the sand is beautiful. What about you?"
1367,"we've got a beach house, spend many weeks there every year. "
1367,"I would love to have a beach house. A red one, probably. How long have you had it?"
1367,12 years. Do you live close to a beach?
1367,"Reasonably close, probably about a 45 minute drive. Do you take family and friends there?"
1367,"all the time. we love it, everyone loves it"
1368,It was enough money to me -- $10 is not insignificant
1368,"i agree, even if it was just a dollar, it's still YOUR money"
1368,Exactly. I just wish banks were not so greedy with these fees
1368,i would've threatened to change banks if they didn't fix their mistake. 
1368,"I did, and they did finally fix it so I'm feeling a bit better. Especially after some spaghetti and ice cream!"
1368,"that sounds like and odd mix, lol. I would much prefer chinese and ice cream!"
1368,Pasta has always been my comfort food! And I can eat ice cream any time of year :)
1368,what kind of ice cream is your favorite? i'm a cookies n cream kinda gal.
1368,"I love most flavors - but I agree, cookies 'n cream is awesome! I am partial to chocolate too"
1368,mmm chocolate is yummy too
1368,"I must admit it's not the best for my waistline, but it just hits the spot!!"
1368,totally worth it if you ask me.
1369,The circus is the best place in the world. I've worked there for years.
1369,"Wow, really? What do you do there?"
1369,Role playing. I come out to the loudest Country music song I can find and get the crowd stirred up
1369,Cool. How many years have you been working at the circus?
1369,"Started 3 years ago. Do you go? If so, where?"
1369,"I'd like to go to a circus, but there aren't any near me, unfortunately. Instead, I volunteer at an animal shelter to keep me busy."
1369,That's good work. I love animals. You a dog or cat person?
1369,Both! I have three dogs and two cats that I take care of at home when I'm not at the shelter. Do you have any pets?
1369,"One dog. Mixed breed, best kind IMO. Sleeping on the couch now"
1369,All of my dogs are mixed breeds too. I don't even know what kind of breeds they are since I adopted them all off the street.
1369,Same here. She's loves my favortive music and goes with me to the circus. Not a fan of the make-up though
1369,How old is she? All of my pups are only a few years old.
1369,2 years old. Thanks for the chat. Good luck
1370,I think you are correct on that!
1370,My dad would take me to get strawberries in his bentley. They are my favorite fruit! 
1370,I really love bentelys. I think they are the best car around!
1370,I loved my fathers I wish we still had it!.
1370,What happened to it?
1370,He sold it back in the 90s :/

1370,The old ones are always better aren't they??
1370,They really are. It's something about how they were built. 
1370,I wish we could go back to the old days!
1371,I have many siblings and none of them wear glasses. How come I am the one who ended up with needing a pair?!
1371,That's unfortunate! Did you watch lots of TV?
1371,"no, I prefer to be creative and draw. I think I got glasses because I used to watch a lot of TV"
1371,"I can relate, my whole family wears glasses.. although as a librarian it gives me some notoriety, hehe!"
1371,"haha, indeed. I like libraries, I find them very quite and relaxing. Do you work in a big city library? "
1371,I wish! Unfortunately I work in an elementary school at the moment.. maybe one day I'll get to take care of a big notorious library.
1371,"well, sometimes smaller gems are better but don't stop aspiring!"
1371,"Thanks, I appreciate that! What do you do for a living?"

1372,excellent point ! i love the aesthetic of horror movies though but i hate spiders its my biggest fear 
1372,Haha I haaate spiders also! I had to kill a huge one the other day since I was the only adult around at work
1372,well at least I aint the only one i guess they are terrifying lol do you have a religion
1372,"I am a christian, what about you?"
1372,i am also i pray for my family everyday to keep them safe i love god i am not over the top but i pray alot 
1372,"I don't pray as much as I should, although I try to act like a good christian... that counts, right?"
1372,of course i think anything is better than nothing right?
1373,There are many people of diverse backgrounds. I meet many of them on a daily basis in my factory work
1373,Oh we have a union strike going on here where I am!
1373,"Oh no, that sounds stressful! Do you know any one who is a part of it"
1373,Yes my brother in law! Almost a month without work.

1373,"No, it's at GM in Michigan. Whats the night like for you?"
1373,"Not too bad, just enjoying Seattle, just got back from a walk. What about you?"
1373,"Oh it's cold here! I am in for the night, working!"
1373,"It's been moderately warm the past few days, rain has let up. What are you working on?"
1373,I work a lot of jobs. All throughout my day. I have had such a stressful day so work is actually relaxing.

1375,"Me too! It's funny how different those two shows are, but both so well done."
1375,Amen!
1375,"The great thing about binge watching is you can keep going, but the worst thing is waiting for the next season when you get caught up!"
1375,I know how you feel. It's so difficult to start another series once its over. I feel like my whole life has ended!
1376,Me too! Whats your favorite way to make friends
1376,Going out to parks! I met some in my school band too :)
1376,Thats cool! I really like to go to parties. Are you an outdoors person?

1379,That is so interesting. You were born in 1997?
1379,"yes, im a young'n lol!"
1379,I am surprised that someone so young knows barbie girl!
1379,"i'm cuturally influenced, especially about 80's and 90's pop culture"
1379,So do you like movies from the 80's?
1379,"yes , terminator is my favorite , but a close 2nd is the goonies!"
1379,How do you feel about Back to the Future?
1379,the first 2 are amazing the third one is so so in my opinion

1380,"I plan on visiting the Grand Canyon on Friday, and we're going to the movies on Saturday."
1380,Nice. I love movies. What movie are you planning to see?
1380,I am going to see the new Twilight movie with my sister and girlfriend.
1380,"I work part-time, so I could never afford a vacation. Twilight, eh? I thought that series ended years ago?"
1380,So you only work part-time. Are you going to school?
1380,"No. I'm too poor for school, too. I had to get a roommate, just to be able to afford a place to live. He is so annoying."
1380,Sorry to hear your roommate is annoying. What does he do everyday?
1380,"Sits around and drinks, plays video games, and makes a mess. His parents pay his rent."
1380,He sounds like a lazy guy. I hope you find a better job to rent your own apartment.
1380,"Thanks. Me too. His name is Dirk. I call him Dirk the jerk. Stupid name, Dirk. "
1380,That is very funny. Me and my girlfriend are looking to get an apartment soon.
1380,"Move in, but never get married. That's my friendly advice. The number one cause of divorce is marriage. "
1381,Oh no! Why are you so tired all the time?
1381,"Well, I'm starting a new internship soon, so I'm a bit nervous and it's been messing with my sleep."
1381,Oh geez! I am sorry. I am tired too. I work so much :( And school is a lot too. What do you do to be healthy?
1381,"Well it's not exactly exercise, but it helps me a lot to visit the local themepark. I ride the rollercoasters there all the time."
1381,Wow! Doesn't that get expensive?
1381,"It does, but if my internship goes well, I'll have enough money that it won't be a problem!"
1381,True! What do you want to do for a living?
1381,"Well, my internship is at a construction site, so I hope to work my way up to superintendent and do that for a while. How about you?"
1381,I enjoy working on cars. I also like working with animal;s
1381,"That's wonderful, do you volunteer at an animal shelter?"
1381,Oh I AM the animal shelter lol!
1381,"Ah, so you have a lot of pets then? "
1381,Oh SO many rescues!
1382,That means you actually like watching people loose their money!
1382,its just fun to see how it will turn out. 
1382,Is their anything else you consider fun?
1382,i love traveling with my three kids do you have children?
1382,"Sorry autocorrect before, its was supposed to be ""There"". Anyway, I love traveling too, but no kids yet as I recently got married!"
1382,oh how exciting congratulations
1382,Thank you very much. We're still on our honeymoon phase
1382,oh so fun! Enjoy your time when you have kids life is extremely busy now.
1382,Is that so? I love kids though. I have 2 siblings and my brother is 12years younger than me. Oh he's a handful! 
1382,oh i am sure he is lol but yes between sports school all the activities they love but its all worth it!i love them so much
1382,That's so sweet! 
1382,Yes they keep you on your toes for sure! what do you do for fun
1383,Do you think there's a language that only depressed people understand?
1383,"the feeling is so bad you feel hopelessness,no mood i also felt so worthless."
1383,I'm so sorry you were feeling that way. How did you cope with it?
1383,"Well it took some time to learn to cope and a lot of effort, however I learned so much from it."
1383,"What did you learn? I was watching a spanish movie where the character was depressed and he learned so much, too"
1383,Learned what were my triggers and and then how to cope when those feelings started.
1383,"Cool, that must have been hard. It's different for everyone"
1383,"Yes, but not impossible."
1383,That's good. What made you realise it wasn't impossible?
1383,I was determined to make a change and believe I can become a better person.
1383,"That's really inspirational. I don't think movies ever get it right when they portray depression, as much as I like movies"
1383,"My movie would be: I am short, love tomatoes, get depressed sometimes, but that's okay!"
1384,I'm shocked they knew just what to get me. I'm glad I have such good friends.
1384,You are really lucky to have great friends! My mother is so lonesome sometimes since dad died.

1385,Can you take your meals? I try to take my meals when I work. 
1385,oh great idea!
1385,What kind of TV shows do you like? I watch Jimmy Fallon every night.
1385,"I wish I had time for shows, I am always swamped"
1385,Sorry to hear that. When I miss a show I usually catch it on Youtube
1385,you are full with great ideas! but when I have time I rather take a nap to recharge
1386,Was that the one about the people living in New York with the weird neighbor?
1386,"No, that was Seinfeld, Friends is about a groups of friends in New-York. It is even popular in England, my brother told me, he lives there."
1386,"Oh, right. I've seen that all over Netflix now. I've been meaning to watch that. Is it good?"
1386,"It is really good, it is my favorite show, there is humor and romance. "
1386,Sounds good! I will try to look it up and give it a watch! I'm kind of in the middle of a classic anime right now.
1386,"I highly recommend it, there are 6 principal characters, so there is plenty of interesting interactions. What are you watching ?"
1386,Seven Deadly Sins. I watched it several years ago and just decided to re-watch it. I had forgotten how good it was!
1386,What it is about ?
1386,A group of warriors with special powers. It's back story is very involved and unfolds over the course of the show. 
1386,"My brother in England would like, he likes complex stories. Have you ever been in England ?"
1386,I have! I went on a class trip when I was in primary school. We had a wonderful tour of London.
1386,"That sounds like a fun trip, I go see him every year, London as so many beautiful museums. "
1387,It's funny i first learned to love pickles at karaoke night i was offered one. After that i was hooked!
1387,haha you're hilarious! when I place the order in McDonalds I asked for extra but they were cheap!
1387,That's awesome that they don't cost that much! And thank you!
1387,hard boiled eggs are my favorite and pickels on the side with some teas - delicious!
1387,Eggs are okay i like them in the morning!
1387,"A boiled egg in the morning is hard to beat, especially because they're cooked within their shells!"
1387,Very true! How about coffee?
1387,I am more of a tea person
1387,I like camomile tea! somes black tea
1387,I love Chai tea with a bit of milk and honey
1387,Milk goes great in tea! honey too. You have great tastes!
1387,I love Chai tea with a bit of milk and honey
1388,Oh I have dealt with so many like that my whole life so I know it well!
1388,"That stinks, but at least you know how to handle yourself, right?"
1388,Oh somewhat! You can't let them turn you into them you know?
1388,"I work for the navy, so I know what you mean. Lots of people in positions of authority who shouldn't be. "
1388,Oh man! But do you still like being in the navy?
1388,It beats being in the Army if you ask me! The pay sure is better. What do you do? 
1388,Oh I am working on school but I also run a few businesses. Not enough time in the day
1388,"Wow, what kind of businesses do you run?"
1388,Oh working for a few companies kind of self employed and also selling things on the side.
1388,I see. Are you doing well for yourself?
1388,Well I am doing ok!
1388,That's good to hear. I hope you have lots of success with your business endeavors!
1389,Oh yeah! Most definitely. 
1389,How many pets do you have?
1389,"I have two dogs and a twin sister if you count her, haha what about you?"
1389,"haha! I have a dog, a cat and a squirrel. "
1389,A squirrel?? That's pretty awesome! 
1389,Yeah! I found him lying to die last summer. Managed to feed and look after the fellow for around 8months inside a room and now he's real tame
1389,"Oh my gosh, I'm such an animal lover and that's so sweet."
1389,You should see him now! He's let loose but he comes home when it gets dark and sleeps in his corner. It's a wonder my cat hasn't murdered him yet!
1389,Aww! True that! They may end up being best friends.
1389,I truly hope so! But you know how cats are. You never know!
1389,oh yea without a doubt
1389,what are your pets names?
1390,He's a basset/lab mix.
1390,"Awesome! I have a mixed pitbull! They are the best dogs ever, in my opinion"
1390,"That's cool! I have friends with pitties, and they are super-sweet dogs. Does your dog like to play frisbee? "
1390,Frisbee as in the actual game or just throwing it to him. Sometimes he plays ultimate frisbee with my friends and I
1390,Fun! I meant just catching it and bringing it back.  My dog loves to play.  Is ultimate frisbee like frisbee golf?
1390,"They're kinda similar, but ultimate frisbee is a little more team based. Points are scored by throwing the frisbee into the opponents endzone."
1390,That sounds really fun.
1390,"Yeah, it's a fun time, especially with friends. Do you play frisbee golf?"
1390,"Yeah. Just for fun with friends and family.  None of us are very good, but it's nice to do stuff outside.  "
1390, It's always good to find ways to be active. Do you play sports with your dog?
1390,"mostly just going for walks and hikes and playing fetch.  His lab side always wants to do stuff, but his bassett hound side is lazy :-) "
1390,"What a cute, contradictory pupper. A personality for everyone!"
1391,Working 8 day a week and school
1391,oh wow. yes school and work together can be exhausting
1391,yes. i mean to say 8 hours a day. haha
1391,"oh i gotcha , typos happen ha"
1391,How your day been going?
1391,Good. I just came back from a run with my 2 dogs. Now just relaxing
1392,"I know right, I've been in such a funk over it for the past week,since I found out."
1392,At least she's moving for a good reason.  I had a similar thing with a childhood friend who moved for school.
1392,"I've been saving up to buy a new camera, looks like I need to go ahead and get it and take lots of photos of her!"
1392,"Yes.  But you'll get used to her being away eventually.  Remember, you were once someone's child who left home too"
1392,"I know, I know.  I'll just miss seeing her long pretty hair blowing in the breeze the most.  Her hair is as long as mine."
1392,That's nice. I think long hair is very beautiful.
1392,I've had long hair all my life.  I have photos of myself as a baby in pigtails. Lol
1392,Haha! That is so cute!
1392,"Which makes me sad, because my daughter had pigtails when she was a baby too: ("
1392,"Still cute though, you must be proud."
1392,"Yes, very proud and I'm glad in a way she's taking this step to the next stage in her life."
1392,"Indeed, the future could be bright for her."
1393,I don't smoke anymore. I quit six years ago. Best thing I ever did.
1393,That's amazing. I don't smoke either as it affects my lifestyle
1393,"I still smoke cannabis, but that's harmless. Great for relaxation, as well."
1393,"Haha! As a fitness freak, I have actually decided on living substance free. Do you think i'm missing out?\"
1393,Well...yeah. I have a nephew who is a fitness freak. Smokes cannabis daily. It helps him focus on his runs.
1393,Maybe I might give it a shot then!
1393,"Definitely. I travel to Colorado every other month. Six hour drive, but I love doing it."
1393,Wow! that takes some guts! 
1393,Nah. I never bring any back. You will LOVE the high though. Your imagination will soar!
1393,You're tempting me real bad! 
1393,Try it. You will love it. 
1393,I truly hope it helps my squatting! 
1394,Why is that awesome i'm going to die?
1394,Well I believe we can always choose to look at the positives. At least you have time to spend left with your family and friends.
1394,Very true! i'm trying my best to enjoy it
1394,Is there anything on your bucket list?
1394,Kinda of lame but see that grand canyon 
1394,It's an amazing sight. We should go skydiving! 
1394,Thats a great idea! i'll add that to the list!
1394,What advice would you want to leave for future people?
1394,"Its basic but true, Live life to the fullest and don't let the small things get to you!"
1394,I am going to get that tattooed on my arm!
1394,Awesome i hope i looks good!
1394,I'll make sure to dedicate it in your honor!

1400,"It was pretty weird, though. I didn't talk to him, though"
1400,Most people are pretty cool if you take the time to say something
1400,I just wasn't sure what to say. And I felt kinda awful drawing attention to him lol
1400,Still pretty cool that you saw him. 
1400,"Yeah, or at least I thought it was him. Legendary career he had"
1400,I have not seen anyone famous but recently moved outside of NYC so I am hopeful. I needed to get away from my family
1400,That's a nice area to be. Where did your family live?
1400,"I was in Arlington, VA but my family and I do not get along much so I decided to follow a close friend who was moving there"
1400,"That's fair, nothing worse that strife with people. How's the workforce there?"
1400,Well that depends on how you look at it. There are lots of jobs but not with the income to support living on my own. 
1401,Yeah so do I. I work as a truck driver and my back aches all the time.
1401,i get chronic back pains . nowch ! !
1401,When did they start?
1401,this back thing is chronic . they say probably stress related .
1401,That's a bummer... I love to travel but I try not to do long car rides because of my back
1401,that is tough . as a truck driver i have seen my fair share of that .
1401,What's your favorite place in the world?
1401,interior of australia . hot . dry . lots of dangerous things .
1401,Haha I hear you! I've never been there.. have you?
1401,Yes! Didn't see any dangerous things though. Maybe next time.
1401,You like danger?
1401,Sometimes. It can be exciting. 
1402,"It's a tall wooden chair, to match my tall frame. Very well built, just like me..."
1402,"That's cool, I'd like to find a good chair for gaming.  I love playing video games and I actually design them, as well."
1402,You can borrow my chair if you want. What games do you like to play?
1402,"Your chair is probably too tall for me since I'm so short, dude.  You know me old school PAC MAN is my favorite."
1402,I'm more of a Tetris man myself. I play it sometimes in the laboratory when I'm on break. 
1402,Tetris is rad too.  Some of the newer games are too scary to me.  I'm afraid of the dark!
1402,I can make you some Bravery Pills in the lab. I'm a scientist you know.
1402,"That would be awesome!  They wouldn't make me grow two heads or have hairy knuckles, would they? Lol"
1402,Hopefully not. That sounds like a fun game you can design someday.
1402,I like designing new games.  Would you like to come over and play with me sometime?
1402,Only if I can wear my white coat and safety goggles.
1402,"Sure, I love role playing as well!"
1403,"It's a mater of perspective, I think. I'm just so busy with school, I couldn't imagine being tied to a single person."
1403,Understandable. But remember that no relationship is perfect. It takes both working hard for it to work.
1403,"I see your point. But what do you do for work? Without enough free time, I imagine it's very difficult to spend time on a marriage."
1403,"Yes, but not impossible.I work in an office, but my husband was a career soldier with the U.S. Army. He was deployed for months at a time."
1403,"Well, good on you for remaining loyal. If I were in your position, I don't think I'd be able to. That's why I just focus on school and community theater."
1403,It sounds like you stay very busy. 
1403,"Yes, I don't really have any free time for a relationship. Do you keep yourself busy with any hobbies?"
1403,I enjoy reading - mostly horror and fantasy.  What kinds of community theater do you do?
1403,"I do stage acting at the local community college sometimes, but most of the time I act as a stagehand."
1403,I bet that is really interesting! I'm always fascinated by the work that happens behind the scenes. 
1403,"It's a lot of work, but it's not nearly as stressful as medical school, so it's a relief to me."
1403,Oh! Are you in medical school? No wonder you have such a heavy workload.
1404,"I read an interesting article about bikes, I love riding my bike."
1404,I do as well! Do you ride road bikes or mountain bikes?
1404,"Usually mountain bikes, sometimes I bring my three dogs along for the ride. How about you/"
1404,I don't have a dog myself. I just like seeing the dogs there.
1404,Oh do you have any pets? I also have a cat.
1404,"No cats for me, I have a dog. "
1404,What kind of dog?
1404,A corgi. Do you read the newspaper?
1404,"Cute! I do sometimes, do you/"
1404,"Yes I do, I actually work at one!"
1404,That's interesting what is your job title?
1404,I do advertising sales for the paper
1405,Do you think they should start putting an extra tax on it?
1405,Hahaha I certainly hope not! I drink like four a day!
1405,That's fair. I think adults should be able to do what they want. My three kids drink it too much though lol
1405,"Yeah, I keep saying I need to cut soda altogether. "
1405,"Same here, my doctor told me I have high cholesterol "
1405,So you have 3 kids? Do you all go to the movies often?
1405,"Not too much, they're really expensive. The kids are old enough to use their allowance money on them if they want"
1405,I have 2 and we do not go often for the same reason. Plus we do not like the same types. What types of movies do you enjoy?
1405,I like horror and comedy films. Kids can't really stand horror haha
1405,I love horror! And I love alien invading the earth type stuff too. But the last movie we saw was Toy Story 4 lol
1405,Pixar films are amazing. I think it's the only thing my kids and I can agree on!
1405,yes! There were a few times I was laughing and my kids were like ummm Mom..what is so funny?! Those are the best
1406,Nice. What's your favorite kind?
1406,I always get a bean burrito.
1406,So you don't eat meat?
1406,Yes i do. I love a good steak
1406,Ah! so do I. Could really use one right now
1406,Nothing like a ribeye and baked potato. Now i'm hungry
1406,haha yes! I'd change that to a mashed potato though!
1406,I work at the local medical center and they have the best baked potato's in the cafeteria
1406,Oh brilliant! I haven't tried a proper baked potato in a while.
1406,"I like mine stuffed with bacon bits, cheese and sour cream and of course plenty of butter"
1406,Sounds yum! oh i'm super hungry now!
1406,quick and easy too. i go to community college after work and just stick potato in microwave and its good to go
1406,Do you heat it for around 6 - 7 minutes in the microwave?
1406,i do mine for 10 minutes
1407,Oh man me too! I'd rather be home relaxing and reading. What would you do?
1407,"I'd definitely have my sisters come over to my studio apartment for some wine, take-out, and a funny movie."
1407,Oh I haven't done that in awhile. I miss days like those
1407,"I'm just blessed and so grateful to have 3 awesome sisters...we belly laugh whenever we get together, and that is the best! Do you have siblings?"
1407,Aw :) I do- but unfortunately they are so different from me and I just can't trust them so I don't hang out with them.
1407,I'm so sorry to hear that :'(  Why haven't you done something like that in a while? Do you have any close friends?
1407,Well I am a caregiver for someone with a severe mental illness...and I also have fibro and work a lot- So it makes it hard to have any friends honestly.
1407,I'm so sorry to hear that. It was the hardest thing for me being a caregiver to my grandmom with Alzheimer's. 
1407,I find a lot of people with illnesses of the brain do similar things. They get very aggressive. TBI here too Was your grandma mean or nice during it?
1407,"It was odd that she was STILL as sweet and soft-spoken as ever, b/c I hear that they can become totally opposite of their true personality. It was a blessing."
1407,Yes they do a lot! Alzheimers...not as much. But they do with dementia often and TBI's. 
1407,"Is the person you're caring for related to you, or is it a paid job? Do you like doing it?"
1408,Everything in moderation!  Lots of things can interfere with my epilepsy.  I have to be careful.
1408,"Yea, it is better in moderation. That's true"
1408,I went to the Y this morning for a swim and I saw Larry King.  Can you believe that?
1408,Wow! No I can't. Did you talk to him?
1408,"Yes, we had a long talk about politics of all things.  I love to swim, how about you?"
1408,I love swimming!
1408,"Good, you should come join me for a dip one morning, maybe we'll bump into Larry, again. Lol"
1408,LOL! That would be great. Which Y are you going to?
1408,The one right off Broadway next to the Starbucks.
1408,Oh! Maybe we can go for coffee after?
1408,Sounds like a date! Lol
1408,You're buying! :P
1409,"nice, that sounds like fun"
1409,"Yeah, I really enjoyed it, it was a good way to get closer with them. "
1409,"my wife is pregnant, and one day i hope to work on cars with her, i can't wait to experience bonding like you do"
1409,"Wow, congratulations! Working together on a project is a great way to get closer."
1409,"thank you, i'm admiring you doing that with your daughters myself"
1409,"Thanks, My daughters are a handful but I love them. Will this be your first child?"
1409,"yes, that's right, i can't wait though! how many daughters do you have?"
1409,"I have three daughters, all under ten years old. They keep me on my toes!"
1410,I work in a flower store. Where do you work?
1410,Great! Thats out in Lancaster Pa. I work in Lancaster right now. It's still full of Amish people. Back home in Pittsburg I worked in manufacturing like most others.
1410,That's very interesting. Do you have any children?
1410,No i do not. But i wish someday after getting married i will have my own. Do you like kids?
1410,I love children. I have one of my own. A boy. He's 12 and loves to play baseball. Do you enjoy watching baseball?
1410,Not usually but I will for the right occasion.  Is he on a team at school?
1410,"He's not on a team at school, but he plays on a competitive team. Do you enjoy watching any sports?"
1410,Does you enjoy watching him as much as he enjoys playing?  and It depends on who's playing!  Haha
1410,"That's a good question. I'm not sure who enjoys it more. I probably enjoy watching him more, truth be told."
1410,"Sounds wonderful, I hope to have children one day so maybe I can experience those wondrous feelings first hand :)"
1410,"It really is something. I never thought I would have children. I didn't want to give up my free/me time, but i'm so glad i did."
1410,I can imagine it is very satisfying to get to spend the day with your own children! Definitely needs its breaks though.
1411,"Agreed, that's why I drive a car. Do you have a moped?"
1411,actually have 2. Better on gas milage
1411,I work at a bar and most of the patrons are getting them now. Paying less on gas seems great!
1411,Work at a bar seeing all the good looking ladies. Plenty of cold showers
1411,"Yeah, for real! "
1411,One of these day's i may get lucky but i have trouble keeping eye contact
1411,"Just tell them you're vegetarian. I'm actually vegetarian, but it's a great ice breaker"
1411,you are so wise ! never thought of that .
1411,"No problem, sometimes it's hard to make eye contact"
1411,I am not giving up. After a couple of drinks i loosen up
1411,"Yeah, that helps too. Anything that gets you more relaxed is a huge plus"
1411,Loosen them up also
1412,Probably look into getting it fixed.
1412,well its better to get that fixed then wait and have no car . My sisters drive me around
1413,You don't need them anyway. This will teach you to be self reliant.
1413,"If my parents helped me pay for college, i would of graduated already."
1413,True but honestly we only have ourselves in this world. It's hard to find those who we trust or who care for us really
1413,"That is very true, i am lucky enough to have a few siblings and friends i can count on."
1413,If you even have one- you are incredibly lucky! 
1413,yes ! i am very blessed . did you go to college ?
1413,No not fully yet but I am working on it. I am in business school
1413,"Oh, very cool. I thought about majoring in Business, too!!"
1413,What are you majoring in?
1413,I originally wanted to get a BA in Business management.
1413,"Business is tough but it's probably one of the best degrees to get, honestly."
1413,you are right ! thanks for chatting with me ! and good luck !
1413,Thank you so much!
1414,"Ahaha, it makes me nervous to think about. I have some pretty severe anxiety, so childbirth worries me to death."
1414,oh i did too but you'll be happy once they are here!
1414,"Yes, my husband is an engineer, so I know we'll be well taken care of."
1414,That is nice are you going to be a stay at home mom? I wish i could!
1414,"Yes, I am truly blessed. What kind of job do you have?"
1414,I'm a financial analyst
1414,"Wow, that sound difficult. Does it consume a lot of your time?"
1414,not really i try to turn my career off once i'm home and spend time with family!
1414,"Ah, I hope you're able to. I think work should always come second to family, so I hope you get enough time with them."
1414,Yes i agree.  Family is always first. 
1414,Do you have any hobbies that have helped you stay healthy during the pregnancy?
1414,I just tried to eat healthier and drink lots of water.  Stayed away from processed foods and stayed active. 
1415,Nice! Henry Ford is an inspiration
1415,"Ford is what made him famous! Also, Ford have a 8% stake in Aston Martin too?"
1415,Is that so? I remember Ford selling their Aston Martin shares in 2007
1415,I'm not sure if they sold them. I thought they owned 8%. Either way I love my ford mustang
1415,"Aha! I would say that I love my Ferrari but eh, too broke to own one yet. Oh Enzo!"
1415,"Yeah I'm pretty broke too since I am a college student, but I saved up for years to buy my mustang"
1415,Wow! that sounds amazing. I hope i could save up like you
1415,You definitely should. Saving should be a very important habit for every individual. You never know what could happen in life
1415,"Well true, but its not like i earn much lately"
1415,Yeah I think a lot of people can relate to that. Hopefully wages in this country will get better soon
1415,Fingers crossed. But  truly I need to find a way to save up and afford a mustang!
1415,I hope you get your mustang one day!
1416,"I love to hear them jamming out to ""Sugar"" by Adam Levine."
1416,"Nice! That's one of my son's favorites too, haha"
1416,"I'm so in love with Adam, always team Adam for sure.  How about you?"
1416,"I like him a lot, but it seems like you like him a little more lol"
1416,"He's the total package for sure, but I love my two kids more. Lol"
1416,"Well, how could a parent not love their kids the most... My son is the world to me so I understand"
1416,You just have the one son?
1416,"Yep, that's correct"
1416,"That's awesome, nothing like kids to make you feel young again."
1416,Exactly! I love having fun with him
1416,What do you like doing the most with your son?
1416,Playing drums of course!
1417,"I gave her a coloring book, but that doesn't seem to work."
1417,Hmmm.. How old is she?
1417,She is 5 years old.
1417,Could you ask her what she would like to do? That way she does not feel like you don't want her to talk to you.
1418,Oh lol! He is not really blues. Cake or pie?
1418,Cake!! Always
1418,Hmm. I can go either way! Chocolate or white chocolate/
1418,Chocolate! is that even a question!
1418,NEVER lol. But some people ;) Although I just saw how chocolate was made and it is a bit gross.
1418,I'm sure I'll still eat chocolate after watching that!!
1418,Hmm..Well did you know it's from a bean? And it has to ferment which means it gets stuck in hot weather all stinky?
1418,"Yes! Cocoa bean i think thats what its called. I mean we eat meat, what can be worse than that? Oh wait, MUSHROOM!"
1418,Ohh...I guess but I do like some mushrooms. They are just a fungus. Yeah meat is bad :( 
1418,I mean if we could eat that then why get grossed out by beans!!!
1418,"I don't do meat. Well it's not the beans themselves, just the process to extract chocolate is pretty gross."
1418,Sorry! I really need to watch the process then
1419,You think I could shoot them with my bow?  I bet I could hit them under water.
1419,"They may be to small, they are the size of bugs. Maybe a lobster!"
1419,"Well, I like to think I'm a pretty good shot.  You don't think it would ruin the meat though, would it?"
1419,of course not ! what else do you do in your spare time ? I play sax in a jazz band
1419,"Do you?  That sounds pretty rad.  I already mentioned shooting bows, but I like to remodel homes as well.  I find both to be very satisfying."
1419,"Nice, what kind of bow? I want a crossbow"
1419,"Crossbows feel a bit like cheating to me - crank, aim, fire! I prefer the long bow, it requires a strong arm and a steady hand."
1419,wow that's interesting ! maybe i'll try that out when hunting
1419,"You should, but remember to only loose the arrow when you are certain of a kill.  You don't want to injure the animal by mistake."
1419,you are so wise ! never thought of that .
1419,"Makes sense when you use a bow and arrow on a regular basis. Animals give their lives to feed us, so we should treat them with respect."
1419,Agreed. P.E.T.A- people for the eating of tasty animals!!
1420,I go to the state university and the have student's from all over the world. You can learn alot by associating with them
1420,I met a lot of international students when I was at college too. One of them got me hooked on foreign films.
1420,Never got into foreign films i am more of an outside person
1420,"I like spending time outside too, though sometimes I bring my laptop with me! Do you ever travel, see new places?"
1420,More of a homebody. Money is tight
1420, hear you. Travelling is expensive. I guess that's why I like foreign media - a chance to experience another culture when you can't travel.
1420,I hear you. Once i get my degree and a good job maybe then
1420,Yup. Just don't wait too long; once you have a job it can be hard to get time away to travel.
1420,Hopefully my job will include traveling around
1420,That would be great. Get work to foot the bill for the travel! What kind of work are you hoping for?
1420,Petrochemical field
1420,Sounds impressive. That's an industry undergoing a lot of change right now. 
1421,"Oh okay. Figured I'd ask, because I'm near-sighted and wear contacts myself"
1421,"Two of my three roommates wear them, as well."
1421,I would suppose that partial blindness is a common trait among many people these days then
1421,Apparently!  Have ou ever worn the colored conatcts?
1421,"oh, not personally - but I've seen them on other people, close up it looks like pixelated eyes haha"
1421,"I know, some of them are really greaky looking.  One of my roommates is wearing the zombie ones for Halloween this year."
1421,That should be scary for sure; are you guys going partying or trick or treating this year?
1421,"Actually we're all headed to my parent's school where they work, we're helping out with their Fall festival.  Should be lots of fun running the Haunted house."
1421,"That sounds awesome, should be fun scaring unsuspecting people. Speaking of haunted, the house I live in is filled with ghastly apparitions "
1421,"Wow, that must be scary for you!"
1421,"Not really, well, maybe at first. But a person can get used to anything, given enough time"
1421,"You're so brave, I'd have to move. Lol"
1422,Yes. I would like to save my marriage if I can
1422,Yes it's important to try to fix things. But what will you do if you have to split up?
1422,I suppose I will have to move out and support myself. We own a home together
1422,Do you have a good job? I hate mine. I wish I didn't have to work.
1422,That's too bad. I really enjoy my job. What do you do?
1422,"I work in IT, what about you? My job doesn't pay well, I wish I made more money."
1422,I work in employee benefits for an insurance broker. I wish I made more money though too
1422,"Insurance brokers are the guys who sell insurance for a kick-back, right?"
1422,"The broker gets a commission from the insurance company, but I work in account management, so I do mostly HR for our groups"
1422,"Cool, so you don't have to directly deal with customers then?"
1422,"Nope, I work with the admins for the groups. It's nice. I used to do direct HR for a school system, and that was much more stressful!"
1422,I can imagine it would be. You don't need that stress in your life.
1422,Done
1423,Nice! I haven't gotten out of the house at all today. The weathers got me real bad! sigh!
1423,"Oh, tell me about it. We have had similar weather and I have been cooped up with the kids inside all week"
1423,oh no! I hate being cooped up inside. I should atleast try and take my dog out for a walk tomorrow
1423,I know. I love taking the kids and our dog on walks across the street to the park. It gets us out of the house. 
1423,That's lovely! I have a park right outside my back yard. So great actually. 
1423,I sure hope the weather gets better for both of us soon!
1423,I hope so too. I'm already dreading winter
1423,"Oh, I can't wait for winter. At least it won't be 95 degrees in the winter!"
1423,Haha! It's actually quite cold on my end. 
1423,"Well, that makes sense! Do you like to cook as much as me?"
1423,I love cooking and baking! I find joy in creating my own dishes!
1423,I adore baking for my children and husband. I am much better at baking than cooking on the grill!
1424,Oh I have a lot of issues! Tons of neuropathy.
1424,What happened to the toe?
1424,Well I have serious sciatica issues that caused it to lose feeling and back problems
1424,"Well I think my boyfriend had issues with his foot, he's even had a few hospital visits for it."
1424,Oh man! Did he have a ruptured disc? That is what I had
1424,"Not exactly sure on details, but something raptured for sure. Does it hurt?"
1424,I had to have surgery..and I hate surgery..and I also stretch and try to take care of myself. it can happen to anyone. Yes it hurts 
1424,Well there is always an option to cut it out. Who needs the toe these days?
1424,Oh no. My whole foot is numb. I def can't cut it off lol
1424,"Well, could be a great conversation starter. lol"
1424,True that! lol. But I am not sure if people want to hear about such gore.
1424,"Yeah, I understand your concern. At this stage follow the doctor's order. When is your next check-up?"
1425,"It's hard work, it makes sleeping in on the weekends so enjoyable   "
1425,I hear that. I take it that you're in pretty good shape then?
1425,"I would say so, it's nice to stay active. I just wish my commute wasn't an hour long."
1425,"Ah, long commutes stink. I live just down the street from the store I run, so I'm pretty fortunate."
1425,Yeah that is pretty fortunate. Does your shop sell vinyl? 
1425,"Oh yeah, that's how I make most of my sales, actually. No one really buys CD's or cassettes anymore, but vinyl is always popular."
1425,Wow that's interesting I would've thought CD's would still be popular. I still enjoy listening to CD's on my commute
1425,"CD's are cheap, but people seem to prefer vinyl. A lot of people see vinyl as more authentic, you know?"
1425,"So true, vinyl creates a nice atmosphere that CD's or streaming can't really replicate "
1425,"Yeah, CD's were around for only so long, whereas vinyl was how people listened to music for almost a hundred years. It's timeless."
1425,"It's crazy how vinyl has stood the test of time unlike so many other forms of medias and technologies, especially in this day and age"
1425,"Yes, the technology itself is very simple. A vinyl disc can last an entire lifetime, much longer than a CD or an MP3 player."
1426,"we will just see a lot of different things, lots of sites"
1426,That sounds fun. I've never been out of the country. Is it a first for you?
1426,"yup, this will be the first time out of the country for me, gonna be awesome"
1426,My plans for my upcoming vacation are to read and play with my pet lizard Gila.
1426,well that sounds like a very relaxing time! how long have you had your pet lizard?
1426,"A few months. I saw her in a purple cage, my favorite color, and I had to have her"
1426,so the color of the cage is why you got the lizard??
1426,"No, it's what drew me to her. The color caught my eye. You have pets?"
1426,i have a dog yes!
1426,Dogs are awesome. So loyal. What breed?
1426,"its a mix breed, part pomeranian part shih tzu"
1426,How cute! My mom had a shihtzu when I was growing up. They're smart dogs.
1427,yea making clothes is always really fun
1427,"It really is!  Took a while for me to really get into it, but I love using recycled materials while sewing."
1427,yea being environmental friendly is great for everyone involved and you can make some really nice things. what all do you like to sew?
1427,"Oh you know, Pillows, Blankets, lots of pretty things.  I especially like the colour red since it matches my hair."
1427,oh you have red hair! i bet thats cute :D i just have natural dark brown hair haha
1427,"Thanks!  I know brown doesn't stand out as much as red, but I have always thought brown hair was very beautiful."
1427,"yea ofc, red hair is eye catching for sure. do you have any animals?"
1427,"No, but I wish I did - when I was younger I wanted nothing more than to have a cat.  Probably drove my mom crazy!  You?"
1427,"i have a cat yes, and a doggy"
1427,Awwww!  What are their names?
1427,mickey and mousey haha
1427,Haha! OMG those names are the absolute cutest!
1428,"yes, a pit pull and terrier mix. what's your dog's name?"
1428,"he is corky, i love him to death, hes a cutie"
1428,I love my dog as well. She reminds me much of my old dog. They both love to love people.
1428,"ive had quite a few dogs over the years, i love them all so much. do you have any cats?"
1428,"I don't have any currently, however, i used to years ago. we found her and adopted her."
1428,"ive never had a pit bull, but i would get one if it was ccute enough haha"
1428,They are the most underrated dogs. They are so sweet and outgoing. My dog only wants to protect me.
1428,"awww, i think i might have to get one now "
1428,Pit pulls are gentle giants.
1428,they seem adorable thats for sure. i am deaf by the way
1428,"You're so brave. Not to be rude, but service dogs could be a big help with that."
1428,thats true!
1429,"I pray to God that is so, I live in Texas which has a great health care system that I love."
1429,"That's great, sounds like your father-in-law is in good hands. I'll pray for him too if that's okay with you."
1429,"I surely appreciate it, thank you brother.  Nice to have a friend when you are in need."
1429,"You're welcome, anytime. I imagine that looking after your father in law must take a lot of your time. Do you get out much?"
1429,"Not as much as I like, sometimes I treat myself to some pudding - but I pay for it later, it makes me so gassy!"
1429,LOL! I know how that goes! My boyfriend has been known to threaten to kick me out of the apartment when that happens.
1429,"Haha, I can only imagine!  That's one thing I love about living here in Texas, a pudding shop on every corner!"
1429,"Do they really have shops just for pudding? Wow, that's really specialized! "
1429,"Oh yeah, pudding shops everywhere.  Fills me up, but then I put-put-put wherever I go.  It's a vicious cycle."
1429,HAHA! That must make you popular at parties!  Do you ever try making it yourself at home?
1429,"Haha, only if there was a gas making contest!  I wish I had the talent to make it myself, but not as good as what's in the shops."
1429,"I know, right? I go to weekend craft shows. I like making my own stuff, but it never comes close to what I see at the shows."
1430,I had no idea. I enjoy hunting myself.
1430,I actually am not a fan of hunting. Sorry. 
1430,I also enjoying riding my mountain bike when I go camping. Do you enjoying camping?
1430,I do! Infact I have my own red bike which i ride to work daily
1430,"Thats cool, what do you do for a living? I'm a comic book artist."
1430,"I am a graphic designer, a writer and a photographer. Quite the resume, I know!"
1430,A jack of all trades I see. I would like to see some of your work
1430,I would gladly show them to you. What do you use to draw your comics? A wacom?
1430,"Yes, I use a wacom for the rough sketches. Then, I use editing tools for the finished product."
1430,"Nice, so you mainly use Photoshop then?"
1430,"Yes, Photoshop and a few other tools"
1430,Thats amazing
1431,That sounds very smart! So do you work as a performer?
1431,No I don't but my boyfriend is in acting school so I am around performers a lot
1431,That is so awesome! Do any of them ever get back or nerve issues? I have when I exercise a lot.
1431,"A few do, if they're doing more physical performances. It's crazy how much energy they put into their performances."
1431,I know right?I would love to bottle their energy!
1431,I totally agree. It's so fun to watch their shows.
1431,I love the cirque de soliel. I am actually kind of scared of clowns so I am not sure how I am one!
1431,You're a clown?
1431,Yes in did work as a clown!
1431,Cool! I haven't been to a circus in years. I think I should go again soon.
1431,Just go to the ones without animals please :) They are kind of abused.
1431,Oh sure thing. The two things I hate the most are animals being abused and popcorn
1432,i would love to film the shops and the people.
1432,Absolutely! That would be amazing.
1432,"i film animals too and scenery, but never anything violent."
1432,Does your toddler ever come up next to your pug and ride it like a horse?
1432,Not yet but i would be ready to film it! He is almost tall enough.
1432,How tall is tall enough?
1432,"don't know, tall enough to get on without help"
1432,like 17 feet maybe?
1432,No that's way too tall.
1432,16?
1432,lol. like 3 feet
1432,makes sense. one time I stabbed a man in guadalajara
1432,omg i don't want to hear about that sorry
1433,Yes. I lost my mother in an airplane accident when i was just a child.
1433,That is awful!  My condolences.  How old were you when that happened?
1433,I was only 5 
1433,I'm so sorry.  I'm glad you overcame your fears and flew anyway.
1433,I really didn't want to but i had to attend a meeting for work. I would rather have gone by bus]
1433,"Well, you made it safely! Did you happen to take a flight during the solar eclipse?  I haven't seen one of those since I was eight!"
1433,No i took the redeye
1433,That's cool. Have you seen an eclipse of the Sun?
1433,Years ago. Pretty awesome
1433,It really is beautiful.  Thankfully you can pretty much relieve it from home if you have the internet and a good monitor.
1433,Yea but it's not the same as in person
1433,That's a good point.  Anything else you want to chat about?  I've got high speed internet so I won't have any access issues chatting with you.
1434,"I've thought about it, but I'm just not assertive like that, you know? He's older than me and I get intimidated."
1434,Another reason I dont believe in love
1434,You don't believe in love? That seems kinda sad. Why not?
1434,"Its just a chemical, like when you eat chocolate or drink coffee"
1434,Have you ever thought you were in love?
1434,"Many times, but it is fleeting, its better that way"
1434,"Well, call me naive, I know I'm still pretty young, but I think it's got to be more than that. "
1434,"Speaking of young, I write childrens books"
1434,"Wow, that's awesome! I'm going to university in the fall and still thinking about a major and considering a career as a writer. How did you start?"
1434,I was unemployed and figured how hard could it be!
1434,LOL I guess that's as good a way as any! Was it as easy as you expected?
1434,"Yea, kids arent that good at reading, so...."
1435,How much longer do you have to keep them on?
1435,a year but its gonna feel faster . what do you like to do in your free time
1435,"I like to read, play with my dogs, or watch Netflix"
1435,Nice! I enjoy going to the beaches here in Florida. Have you been?
1435,I have been to a couple! What part do you live in?
1435,I live on the west coast of Florida near the Gulf of Mexico.
1435,Is it pretty there? I've only been to the east coast
1435,It is. But also traffic is crazy and it's a bit overpopulated. But the beauty makes it all worth it
1435,"That sounds nice. I recently moved to Tennessee, so I am hoping to get to the west coast soon"
1435,What is there fun to do in Tennessee?
1435,"I live near the Smokey Mountains, so that's pretty and fun to explore. There's also a lot of music, farms/orchards, breweries, and some dams/rivers"
1435,That sounds so awesome
1435,I really enjoy it so far!
1436,Hello. How are you today?
1436,I’m awful ... 2 herniated discs in my back and in agonizing pain
1436,OMG! I am so sorry to hear that. Back pain is the worst. Are you getting lots of rest and seeing a doctor?
1436,"I did, the doctor prescribed physical therapy. So far, it’s just making everything worse "
1436,Awww. That is the pits. When my back aches I don't want to move at all. Hope doc is right.
1436,"Same here ... I just want to lay down, standing hurts, sitting is worse ... I know what you mean "
1436,I totally know what you mean. I suffer from backaches too...nothing like herniated discs though. It's the worst.
1436,What triggers your back pain?
1436,Usually when I miss a few days of working out and then go back. It's like I overdo or something. 
1436,"Oh wow, i know what you mean! Although in my case right now, exercise immediately shoots the pain up "
1436,We are too young for this kind of pain. I'm going to see Pearl Jam next week so I guess that means I won't exercise:)
1436,"IKR? If we are this young and in so much pain, we have like 70 more years of living in pain. Cool about the concert!"
1437,especially with the mashed potato its amazing
1437,We have one about 15 minutes away.  Also they have a catalog.  I think you can shop online with them.
1437,yeah their service i amazing! they also have a free shipping option for orders over $250
1437,"Wow, I didn't know that.  I love their Swedish meatballs also.  Good to eat when you are hungry after a good swim."
1437,ya for sure their meatballs are amazing
1437,We bought a lamp from them the last time we went there. A dual lamp which sits right next to my chair.
1437,"thats cool i also have a lamp from there! BTW have you ever tried their coffee its fantastic, especially after my karate lessons. mmmmmm its amazing"
1437,"No, I don't drink coffee.  But my wife does. I will have to tell her the next time we go."
1437,ya you have to try it 
1437,My only problem with them is that I am not that good at putting things together.
1437,"they are probably videos that will help. and i also believe you can ask workers to come to your house and assemble your furniture, as they are cooperating with IKEA"
1437,"Yes, that is the way we do it, if my wife can't.  She is pretty good at things like that.  I am the computer nerd."
1438,That's cool. 
1438,"not really, i dont like it.and i also dont like how everyone wants to be my friend"
1438,I'm sorry to hear that.
1438,its not your fault :P maybe im just moody today
1438,"lol, those days happen to the best of us. Do you have any pets?"
1438,i do not have any pets at the moment no
1438,ah gotcha. i have dogs. 
1438,"awesome, which kind of dogs"
1438,two german shepherds 
1438,"oh big dogs, my friend has a geerman shephard i love his dog"
1438,"They are big, but sweet haha"
1438,"haha ofc, i love big sweet dogs. i used to have a dog"
1439,Oh I am the BEST and it is SO FUN!
1439,Do you take it easy on the weak or go in for the win?
1439,I was sly at first and then I went in for the kill at the end!
1439,"Niiice, my son owen does the same thing!"
1439,Oh I don't want any kids. I think I will just adopt some
1439,"That is an option, sometimes my kids annoy me"
1439,"Lol! Well yes, it is a HARD job raising kids!"
1439,Its a balancing act for sure! They follow me in the bathroom sometimes
1439,LOL! Yes kids are much like pets :)
1439,Have you ever had your nails done? I love mine
1439,Well I am a guy so...no ;)
1439,"oh, well its 2019 you never know these days"
1440,"awesome, how old are you? i just graduated high school"
1440,"I am 23, I just graduated college"
1440,"oh wow, awesome. what field?"
1440,"Marketing, What about you?"
1440,im unsure yet what i will be going to college for
1440,do you have any particular interests?
1440,"hmm i love computers, but im not sure if that would carry over into a job for me or not"
1440,Everyone needs a IT guy though so there is definitely job security 
1440,"you are right, i might try that, still thinking long and hard about everything though"
1440,you will have plenty of time in college to decide what interests you the most and what you're good at
1440,that is also true :)
1440,i am still looking for a job and now im concerned i didnt chose the right path in college
1441,I also love that I live so close to work. I can walk there!
1441,Oh cool. I appreciate having time off to play video games
1441,"In my free time, I like to play soccer. "
1441,Oh I have a soccer game which is really great
1441,Cool! Do you play it often?
1441,No because I spend most of my time in the science lab
1441,"Yeah, I know what you mean. I wish I had more free time as well. "
1441,"me too but I really love science, i'm lucky"
1441,"You are very lucky to enjoy what you do. I don't like my job very much at the factory, but at least it's close to home!"
1441,"sorry you have to work there, i love geeking out too much"
1441,"It's okay, it pays the bills. I wish i could play more soccer though. "
1441,Yeah be sure to make time for enough soccer. It's healthy
1442,I live on Lake Oconee in a cabin. Where do you live?
1442,"I live outside of Detroit. I used to live in Kansas though. Grew up on a farm, lol! How about you?"
1442,"I grew up in the city, that's why I'm loving the cabin. Are you a police officer in Detroit?"
1442,Yes. I wanted to make things better since the automotive sector closed down. What do you do for a living?
1442,I'm retired now but I was a school teacher for 40 years. I loved teaching junior high kids. Grandkids are a breeze now! Do you have any children?
1442,My wife is pregnant with our first! Is it easier to raise boys or girls? 
1442,Congratulations to you both! We had a girl and a boy. I think girls are easier to be honest. Do you know what if it's a boy or a girl?
1442,"No. We decided to be suprised, like in the old days. :) My sister says it's a boy because of the way my wife is ""carrying""??"
1442,I remember those old wives tales. Sometimes they come true. Is the nursery ready?
1442,Almost. We still can't decide on a crib. There are so many to choose from. My wife like old fashioned and I like modern. Any suggestions?
1442,As you can imagine I'm sort of partial to old fashioned. Just get one that doesn't take a day to put together! I really wish you well.
1442,"Thank you! My parents can't wait to be grandparents. This is their first grandchild. They plan to spoil him or her. I bet you spoil yours, yes?"
1442,We sure do! There's nothing like it!
1442,"Wonderful! Well, I will let you get back to them. Have a wonderful evening!"
1442,Thanks. Good talking to you
1443,What is your favorite subject to paint?
1443,"I love doing portraits. I love painting people in general. My family, celebrities, characters etc"
1443,That's awesome. I wish I was better at painting faces
1443,I say just practice more. You
1443,That's good advice. Thank you
1443,Yeah you'll be surprised how quickly you can improve! 
1443,What other hobbies do you have?
1443,I also really like reading and going to the beach on my days off.
1443,I love reading too. What's your favorite genre?
1443,"Mystery, and crime are my favorites. How about you?"
1443,Same for me! I've recently been getting into Dan Brown novels too
1443,"i also love dan brown, Inferno is one of my favorites!"
1444,"im not sure, my husband is taking me there, he said we are gonna have a blast"
1444,"Oh fun stuff! You'll have to forgive me, I don't get out much so I don't know a lot about things to do."
1444,"ahh right on, i dont get out much either with having to take care of 3 kids :P but its really fun when i do"
1444,It's definitely a much needed break from parent life. Between school and work I don't have time for much. 
1444,"oh i bet, i love my free time thats for sure!"
1444,Do you have any hobbies?
1444,"not really any hobbies no, work and kids take up most all of my free time sadly"
1444,Ah I understand that.
1444,"yea, it is what it is i guess haha. i love em all tho!"
1444,Family is so important! They make life worth it.
1444,"yup, they make everything worth it thats for sure!"
1444,No doubt! 
1445,Miami oh what a lovely place
1445,"It is i think im going there next year for summer vacation.,"
1445,I'll try go on a vacation to miami .I miss the beach
1445,"The beach helps me to unwind from the everyday grind, you know?  What do you do for fun?"
1445,"Umm swimming, partying"
1445,I love swimming!  
1445,How good are you?.. Swimming
1445,I grew up on the beach so I'm pretty good!  What about you?
1445,I gotta be honest. I'm not really good
1445,I am sure you are good at many other things though.
1445,"You got that right, we all have to be good at something"
1445,"true , very true , so what are you doing ?"
1446,yea i do too
1446,It's a sad situation for everyone involved.  I really just want to snuggle up with my dog and go to sleep
1446,haha i love dog snuggling! 
1446,"Some people think that they are gross to be that close to, but I just find them comforting.  Ugh, class tomorrow morning!"
1446,oh no way! dogs are cute and snuggly
1446,Mine always wakes me up in the morning with his wet nose.  He tries to get me up in time for class
1447,"I'm happier when I'm working on my boat. Once I finish building it, I'm gonna take it out on a long fishing trip! Do you have any plans like that?"
1447,"Whenever I leave my office job for the weekend, I like to get down to a weekend session of gaming.  Do you play any games?"
1447,"Oh, yes...but more like Word with Friends and Candy Crush, lol. I'd love to have any time to learn ""real"" games. ;)"
1447,"All gaming is good, as long as you're having fun.  Tried Candy Crush myself, can be quite addictive!"
1447,Yes it is! I have to give myself a break every once in a while! What's your favorite game?
1447,"Europa Universalis IV - a niche game, but lots of fun.  Can learn some history too.  You should try it!"
1447,"That sounds fun, I might just try it some day."
1447,"Like I said, it's plenty of fun!  But what about your boat, do you have any names planned for it?"
1447,"I'd like the name Jabberwocky, just because it was my and my dad's favorite poem we used to say together. "
1447,"Oh wow, I love Lewis Carrol!  I might need to make one and call it Vorpal Sword haha!"
1447,"Haha! I have no clue what that is, but I'm sure it has to do with one of your games, lol."
1447,"Lewis Carrol wrote the Jabberwocky - it has a vorpal sword in it, haha."
1448,"oh awesome, do you have any favorite stores ?"
1448,I like to go to gift shops a lot
1448,you like buying gifts for friends?

1448,would you like to go on a date with me?
1448,I'd love to but there's something that i think you should know first
1448,what should i know first?
1448,I was born completely deaf
1449,"oh thats awesome, ive never seen it"
1449,"I always used to sit way too close to the screen, my father was always telling me to move back. Good times."
1449,"haha, yea, im gonna watch this later and see how good it is :o"
1449,I look forward to hearing what you think. :)  My dad didn't want me watching it at first. He's a preacher.
1449,"oh, my father was a block mason, so he wasnt too uptight about anything"
1449,"Now I'm an elementary school teacher and I look back at those shows and think, they're pretty tame compared to what they watch now!"
1449,"haha yea, stuff is pretty crazy these days, thats for sure"
1449,Your dad was a mason - did you ever go out and work with him?
1449,i did when i was a teenager yup. it was good to learn that kind of hard work
1449,"it's valuable, that kind of thing...bonding with your dad, creating with your hands..."
1449,"yea it was awesome, and it also taught me a lot"
1449,What do you do nowadays?
1450,I like crispy. I also really like waffle fries
1450,Honestly I agree. Chick-fil-a has some of my favorite waffle fries!
1450,I just had theirs today! They are delicious 
1450,Lucky you! I went to the mall today but decided not to stop at chick-fil-a but I did get a new sweater
1450,That's exciting. I need to buy more fall clothes now that it's getting cooler here
1450,I am so excited for the cooler weather. Do you enjoy cooler weather?
1450,"Yes, I love fall! I feel like summer dragged on forever this year"
1450,It really did. And it's still dragging on here in Florida haha
1450,"Yup, I'm from Tennessee, so I feel the same way. I'm actually in Florida now on vacation and it's warm!"
1450,"Nice! I hope you enjoy your vacation, anything exciting planned?"
1450,"Yes, we're going to a music festival and meeting some of our friends from back in Maryland, so I am excited to see them!"
1450,Oh that sounds so fun. It's always nice meeting up with friends you haven't seen in a while
1451,Well my neighbor isn't feeding her puppies right
1451,"That's terrible, call the cops1"
1451,nah they wouldn't care and she is a teacher at my school so it's awkward if I report her
1451,You can reach out to them if you have a report to make or if you want to help
1451,"on the plus side, one of my students gave me some chocolate today"
1451,"Chocolate lover, hu/ What's your favorite?"
1451,yes i like dark chocolate with toffee omg
1451,want to know a fun fact? I listen to pink when i paint.
1451,"oh cool, she's good and painting is fun. what do you paint?"
1451,"I just paint to create things. Its like Expressive Therapy to me, where the process of creation is emphasized rather then the final product"
1451,"that's great, everyone should make art."
1452,"I am supposed to get dental implants. Being old is really a drag. I miss my younger days, when I completed as a sprinter."
1452,That's expensive I know. Maybe we can incorporate some of your sprinting tales into the video
1452,Sure! I also ran the New York marathon in 1988 and 1991. Do you think people will really be interested?
1452,As long as you didn't get on the subway to finish!
1452,"lol! No, I ran the whole way! So are you a documentarian?"
1452,Iam for the Discovery Channel. I like to tell stories about health and maybe we can show how running positively impacted your life
1452,"Sure! I would enjoy that. My wife can tell you about her gymnast days, too. She competed in the olympics."
1452,That;s really great! I think we can really do something together
1452,"When will you be in my area? I live in upstate New York now, close to the PA border."
1452,I'm in Manhattan so it won't be hard to get together. How about I call you guys next week for an interview?
1452,"That would be perfect! We have a Bed an Breakfast if you'd like to stay the weekend. No cost of course, and my wife will make dinner."
1452,Wow that sounds great! I'll plan on bringing my equipment and we'll get started.
1452,"I look forward to meeting you!  Until then, have a lovely week!"
1453,"Either way, what were they to think?  Covered in band tees,  I was visibly upset and alone!"
1453,Maybe they were just lost lol
1453,"Or they could have been stalking me, after all, the technology my company uses is impressive!"
1453,Technology has it's pros and cons
1453,"You can say that again!  I build drones, so...have you every used one?"
1453,"No, I haven't but they are neat looking! I take it you have. "
1453,Yes!  So what do you do for a living?
1453,:I'm a music teacher. Following in my mother's footsteps :)
1453,Wow!  That must be a fulfilling career!
1453,Oh it is! Seeing people grasp music is amazing to watch.
1453,What is the most challenging aspect of teaching music?
1453,Interesting question...I think it would be when you know a student is right at the brink of learning a new skill.
1454,"Aw, that's too bad.  If you ever want to learn, the basics are really not too difficult. Once you get started, it's really just following directions from a recipe."
1454,"I guess, but eating takeout is so much easier!!"
1454,"haha! It sure is, but your wallet suffers for it, I bet. Though, I shouldn't talk you out of it...I want to open a restaurant someday."
1454,"Nice, its good to have a plan. What kind?"
1454,"I haven't fully decided yet, but I'm thinking maybe Latino food, some kind of fusion maybe"
1454,Tacos are my favorite food
1454,"They're one of my faves too. Do you look for the authentic stuff, or are you a fast-food taco kinda person?"
1454,"Both, when I have the chance street tacos are the best"
1454,"There's something special about eating from street vendors...I don't know what, but there's a whole experience that a sit-down restaurant cant' match."
1454,Exactly. Street tacos in playa del carmen right off the spit was amazing
1454,ooooh that sounds awesome. I've never been there. What's it like?
1454,"Its nice, the vendors are really aggressive. Its gotten worse each time"
1455,"I like candy a lot. If I weren't too old, I'd still go trick or treating."
1455,"I take my kids trick or treating in my corvette, this Halloween once I'm finished with my mechanic day job, it will be all night trick or treating."
1455,That sounds like fun. I think I will buy candy and stay home.
1455,No a bad idea haha.  What's your favourite kind?  I love Oh Henry bars myself.
1455,Right now I like those Reeses Cup pumpkins. It's seasonal! Do you like being a mechanic?
1455,"I love it - like they say, love what you do and you never work a day in your life.  What do you do?"
1455,"I look at the stars while eating candy. I never work a day, because I don't work!"
1455,That gives you plenty of time to eat candy then!  Do you have a favourite star?
1455,Yes. I call it Harold the Star. He's very bright. Does your corvette have a name?
1455,"I call my Corvette Ol' Betsy sometimes, or son of a gun when it doesn't want to work properly haha.  Good thing I'm a mechanic!"
1455,No kidding. I wish I knew how to fix cars. I can't usually have sharp things though.
1455,You can't have sharp things?  Why ever not?
1455,I poke myself. Thank you for talking to me. I have to go now.

1456,"Oh, ok.  My wife has that.  I wish you luck, it's hard sometimes"

1475,"We don't get much snow where I live but on the rare chance it does, it's beautiful."
1475,The best part of a snow day is how quiet everything is.
1476,That's okay. I didn't like her much anyway.
1476,Well I am sure you will find someone much better! You deserve someone who makes you happy.

1476,"I've been down there several times. I live up in Bangor, Maine but travel the whole coast over the year. How long have you been a clown?"
1476,"I've been a clown for most of my life, but they only started paying me recently. Do you like Maine?"
1476,"I love it. There just isn't much work there, so I got into sales. I love clowns but I'm just not very funny, so instead I help them."
1477,"Yeah, I really on listen to techno now.  It's even the only thing I wear haha - only band tees!"
1477,oh no ! i only listen to techno . got a whole wardrobe full of techno band tees .

1477,There's too many good ones to pick a favorite! Do you have a favorite?
1477,"Oh yeah ""Flying Vertebrates"" and ""Lots of Flashing Lights in Your Face"" are two of my faves - do listen to them?"
1477,I like them all. I have been listening to techno since in 1988. How long have you been on the scene?

1481,"I'm sorry to hear about your grandfather passing, my grandparents are deceased."
1481,"I'm sorry to hear about your loss.  My grandfather died about a decade ago, and my grandmother has been on a steady decline since."
1481,"Enjoy every moment you can with her, older people have so much wisdom. "
1481,It's true - she has a lot of plant knowledge.  Uses the bark from birch trees to help with her arthritis.

1482,"Alot of my friends have suggested to study in the library as the work there tends to be more productive, however I usually don't have time because of my job"
1482,"Well, a job is definitely a good use of your time as well! But yea, it's much less nerve-wracking when you study ahead of time."
1482,I just can't wait to get it over with so I can get my free time back; I miss being able to read books in my spare time!
1482,"Reading is definitely a great way to pass the time, everyone has their own escape and reading allows you to be anywhere and do anything."
1482,"What do you like doing in your spare time, I'm very interested in the ways people use their free time"
1483,My boyfriend cheated on me again!
1483,Oh my gosh! That's horrible. Did you break up with him?
1483,You bet I did!  I have to go join my troop this weekend anyway
1483,"Good, I'm proud of you for that. At least it sounds like you have a good distraction coming."
1483,It should be a welcome change of pace
1483,I could use a break myself. Taking care of my grandma all week has been pretty draining to be honest.
1483,"oh I bet, how is she?"
1483,She's doing pretty well. She's been up and walking around more.
1483,"That's wonderful, I hope mine gets there soon"
1483,I'm sure she will!
1483,"She better, I like my Passat, and I don't want to have to change just for her, but it isn't really feasible to cart her around in it"
1483,I hear you. Luckily mine can drive just fine. She mostly has trouble picking things up or standing for too long. 
1484,"How unusual, to have a last name for your first name and a first name for your last LOL"
1484,is that what you do with your last name ?
1484,"No, oddly enough, I teach yoga with a last name like mine"
1484,Very cool! Have you ever done yoga before or would this be a first time?
1484,I'm fluent in yoga. I teach it.
1484,I used to be a fitness instructor so yes.
1484,Great! So was my mom for decades. Do you like old movies? I sure do.
1484,My favorite is The Titanic.  I love old rock!
1484,"Titanic was awesome. I do, too! Do you have a favorite band?"
1484,I love Joan Jett.
1484,I like Pink Floyd
1484,That's one of my favorite too!  Green nails for halloween!  Yes or No! 
1485,"Small world, I have a lizard name nagini!!"
1485,"Cool!  I learned about lizards from my Mom, as a librarian she could get me all the lizards books I ever wanted to read."
1485,"Thats amazing, i like the kind that can grow their tails back"
1485,Those are the best!  I've always wanted to write a book on lizards.  Do you think that would help me get into the publishing industry?
1485,"I dunno, I think a lot of people just self publish"
1485,"Yeah, that could be a good way to start.  Read any good books on lizards lately?"
1485,"Nope, none on lizards. Ive been on a pirate kick lately"
1485,"Pirates eh?  Please, tell me more!"
1485,"nothing too exciting, just something to turn my brain off before i walk my dog!"
1485,Dogs are so cute!  What's your dog's name?
1485,"his name is jasper, hes a bulldog shitzhu mix"
1485,"Jasper, what a pretty name!  I have a cat named George."
1486,"Math can be hard, just find a way to make it seem easier. "
1486,I am terrible at math
1486,I'm good at math and sports. 
1486,"Yes, I have maths fear"
1486,"Don't be fearful, find a way to make it fun. "
1486,I used to forgot math formulas frequently
1486,"Oh, you can make it into a song with cool lyrics to help you remember the formulas. "
1486,"Whenever I think about math, I get apprehension which affects my views about math."
1486,Change your views and your apprehension will disappear. 
1486,"Ah, I see. Well, it's been a lot longer since I did calculus. Good on you, remembering that stuff!"
1486,"I have a great memory, probably because I read a lot. "
1486,"wonderful talent ! do you like to read , too ?"
1487,but if i try to stop i get sick.
1487,Are you eating well?  
1487,yes
1487,That's great!  a healthy diet will help you in many ways.
1487,how many calories should i eat?
1487,I am not sure.  Recommendations are based on your body type and exercise level.
1487,i'm 5'7 and dont excersice
1487,Have you looked up your basal metabolic rate?
1487,33
1487,Maybe just drink once per week
1487,but is thta good when i have an addiction?
1487,Have you sought counseling?
1488,Frustrated at work.  My job isn't leading me where I want to go professionally.
1488,"Yeah, I know the frustrations.  A car blocked me in at work and I had to call the police to get it towed.  Took three hours!"
1488,OH wow!  That's awful.  Did you ever find the owner of the car?
1488,"No!  They had a number on their dashboard that I tried calling, but no answer!  So frustrating.  Made me think of my parents divorce for some reason."
1488,Well I hope the car wasn't a blue one - then it might have been me!?  LOL - Just joking.  Sorry about your parents. 
1488,No worries - mom would get so frustrated at dad that she would block his car from leaving the driveway.  He was always late to work.
1488,That's kind of funny actually.  How long have your parents been divorced?
1488,Five years - since then I've tried to forget about it by being an excellent student and working hard at my job.
1488,That's definitely a good plan.  I just finished my MBA degree.  I think I need to put that to use and find a new job.
1488,What kind of job are you looking for?
1488,Something in marketing or advertising. 
1488,"Well, I hope you find a good job there, the job market can be tough these days."
1489,That sounds like my fave! I didn't know it was called the world's first novel.
1489,the tale of genji is my favorite book . do you read ?
1489,"Cool! Yes, I do. Especially books on pet care BC I am a pet sitter. What do you do?"
1489,I am a scientist
1489,Fascinating! What's your favorite part about your job?
1489,My favorite part is helping the researchers with their studies.But it really depends on the aims of the day.
1489,Have you ever had to perform a task that made you uneasy?
1490,I think lust at first sight exists. Maybe not love
1490,"I don't think there's much difference really; same chemicals, same emotions"
1490,I suppose. The emotions change over time though. Love lasts longer than lust.
1490,"I have never thought of it like that but i guess you're right, lust is more fun though."
1490,Oh yeah! Definitely! Haha!
1490,Have you ever been in love?
1490,Maybe. I'm not sure. I sometimes think I'm too shallow to REALLY love someone.
1490,"Haha, me too.  Shallow, narcissistic, it's actually a lot of fun.  No fun being ""normal."""
1490,"Haha, I'd drink to that!"
1490,what's your drink of choice?
1490,vodka soda water! yours?
1490,"Mmm, that sounds good.  I like the hard liquors too, hard to find an animal friendly beer."
1491,"Yes, I love peaceful places because my children are a handful. "
1491,Having kids is so much fun! How old are they?
1491,Kids are fun. My sons are 1 and 4. Do you have kids?
1491,"I don't yet, but I hope to someday."
1491,"Take you time, no need to rush. But I'm glad having your own family is in your plans. "
1491, have a nephew now and we just had pizza the other night. I can't wait to do that with my own.
1491,"Everybody loves pizza, I have to get it with extra cheese!"
1491,Pizza is awesome! It's not always great for you but I enjoy having it.
1491,"Right, it isn't the healthiest, but amongst the tastiest. I like it with everything on it! "
1491,My favorite topping is probably sausage and I love a good cheese stuffed crust! Plus a beer to wash it down.
1491,"Beer is great to wash anything down, especially chicken!"
1491,Agreed! I can't think of a meal it doesn't pair well with.
1492,i was contemplating on running away
1492,I used to have a big ford SUV that would be perfect for running away
1492,"i design video games, and im kind of burnt out on it , thats why i wanted to run away lol"
1492,i love video games. i drove a big ford truck that i really liked in GTA five once
1492,is ford your favorite automobile?
1492,yea ! i love a ford ! how tall are you ?

1492,whats your job?
1492,I work front desk at a hotel
1493,"Oh, that's cool. What do you do for exercise?"
1493,I enjoy walks around the lake. I have a lot more time to get in touch with nature since I retired. What about you? 
1493,I love to go running. It really gets the blood pumping. It's not so good on my knees though..
1493,Do you have knee injuries? I hope it doesn't hurt you too much. 
1493,"Not serious, but they do get sore now and then. Thanks for your concern. Do you watch much TV?"
1493,A lot more than I used to. Which shows do you like? 
1493,"I love a lot of shows, but one of my favourites is Face Off. How about you?"
1493,I enjoy that one British Baking show. Do you like to bake? I have to wear my glasses to make sure I get the recipes right now. lol 
1493,"I do like to bake, I'm not very good at it though. Are you a good cook?"
1493,Decent enough. I enjoy baking more though. What's your favorite meal? 
1493,I love spaghetti bolognaise. How about yours?
1493,I enjoy Chinese cusine. General Tso chicken is my favorite. Do you visit a lot of resturants? 
1494,I would like to write a mystery novel. 
1494,That sounds interesting!  I often make up stories in my head while I'm working.
1494,Really? That's cool! Do you have a favorite author in the mystery genre?
1494,Nancy Drew!
1494,Classic! I am a fan as well! My favorite author in that genre is Agatha Christie.
1494,What's your favorite Agatha Christie book?
1494,"I honestly like them all, but I particularly like the Miss Marple series."
1494,Do you ever sing what you read?  I can't sing but I do it anyway
1494,"No, but I love music though. What type of songs do you like?"
1494,I really like disney songs
1494,That's awesome! Disney does produce some great songs. What's your favorite one right now?
1494,"""just can't wait to be king.""  what's your favorite?"
1495,"Yeah, I don't know how I'll ever afford to take care of my pet Iguana now."
1495,Well I'm a vet working for a vet hospital in town.  I'd be happy to offer my services if that helps you.  
1495,"That would be so amazing!  I work at McDonalds, so I can't afford very much."
1495,Our hospital has a sliding scale for people with pets who are struggling financially.  You should come in one day and we see how we can help.
1495,"I will!  The Lizard's name is Lizzie, and she's a  . . . what did they call it?  Oh yeah, a Komodo Dragon!"
1495,A komodo dragon?  Are you pulling my leg?  I do like the name though.
1495,Why would I do that? She's about six feet long now! I bring her the leftover hamburgers from work that they can't sell.
1495,I love a McDonalds hamburger.  It's one of my guilty pleasure foods.  
1495,"Yeah, me too.  I was actually joking about the Komodo Dragon, she's actually just an Iguana.  But she is getting big!"
1495,I figured lol.  But now you got my hungry thinking about that hamburger!  I might have to jump on my bike and head to McDonalds!
1495,If you do I can give you a discount!  Is it okay to feed Iguana's hamburgers?
1495,Well....technically they're more omnivores although they do like crickets from time to time.  I'd stick to veggies.
1496,i dont have enough money to move out of my parents house
1496,do you have a friend to couch surf with?
1496,they all have significant others....dont want to inconvenience anyone
1496,"crazy, people get into that so young these days, ""true love lasts forever,"" never seems to last very long to me..."
1496,"not at all, we all crave attention with all the technology we're surrounded by"
1496,"Too true, I see it all the time at work: people lamenting their ""true love,"" or ignoring their dates with phones."
1496,i miss the good ol days when things were much simpler
1496,How romantic!  The old ones are always better aren't they?
1496,Oh without a doubt.....no comparison whatsoever 
1496,Seems like just yesterday smart phones didn't exist.  People actually talked to each other.  Feels like it changed overnight.
1496,I feel like I'm starting to sound like my parents....i think i'm just getting old
1496,"You don't get older, your parents just get wiser.  They grew up so much since I started working ;)"
1497,It's a nice path.  They put asphalt down a few years ago.
1497,at least you didn't damage your bike
1497,"Yes!  It's about 3.5 miles long, so it's a nice trek for a Sunday."
1497,that sounds like a nice sunday
1497,"It is.  I'd prefer to go to the beach, but that's only if I have a whole day available."
1497,oh i love the beach
1497,What do you love about the beach?
1497,"it is beautiful , the view from the beach is just amazing"
1497,It's the perfect summer vacation.  We go every year for about 2 weeks.
1497,it has been a while i went. would love to go soon
1497,How far is a trip to the beach for you?
1497,"about 30 mins from my place, cant wait until next summer"
1498,Looking to move to your own place soon?
1498,I hope to move next year. Time for a house.
1498,Nothing better than your own place.  Even renting for a while is a plus.
1498,"Yup, you are right. A lot of my friends rent apartments near me."
1498,"If you get the right place, with good management, it's like owning your on home.  "
1498,"definitely, having a house and renting one is a lot different"
1498,"With a house, you might be able to have a nice patio with a big grill.  Great for eating healthy during the summer."
1498,i love chicken and turkey cooked on a grill. summer cant wait
1498,Yep!  Along with some fresh veggies and a good beer.  
1498,And beer.. There has to be beer.
1498,What
1498,beer is not an option i meant
1499,"You should definitely give it a listen, he's fantastic! A little old school for some, but it's right up my alley. My roommate and I enjoy it greatly."
1499,I shall! I already like the name
1499,What other sorts of music do you enjoy?
1499,I like country and bluegrass
1499,Me too! Got any particular favorite country act(s)?
1499,Garth Brooks and Conway Twitty
1499,Garth! Yes!!! Callin' Baton Rouge is a personal favorite. That and The Thunder Rolls
1499,Have you seen him in concert live? he is great
1499,"More than once! He puts on an absolutely fantastic show. He and George Strait are my favorite shows, hands down."
1499,George Strait is awesome too. Amarillo by Morning is the best
1499,"Singing to out loud now....my roommate will just have to get over it! They're not a country fan whatsoever, can you imagine?!?!"
1499,Haha they should give it a try
1500,They need more than 1 person can give.  It just didn't seem like enough.
1500,We collect blankets for the homeless in a local town.
1500,"That's good, blankets are a big help, though clothes moreso."
1500,There's a church group that takes donations of clothes.  It's shocking how many folks are homeless.  It's unreal.
1500,"They were very common around college, so I think it's always been this way."
1500,"Yes, it has been.  The media has brought more information to the masses lately."
1500,I've noticed that.  We are surrounded by propaganda constantly.  It's a lot like Brave New World.
1500,"Yes, but it's hard to ferret out the fake news sometimes."
1500,"hah, I was just reading an article on that.  Some company trademarked ""Fake News,"" you might get sued for saying that ;)"
1500,That's nuts.  It's like trying to trademark 'you're fired'.  lol
1500,"Don't give them too many ideas, someone might try :)   Propaganda, after all..."
1500,"True.  We just need to get back to taking care of folks.  Families, strangers, etc."
1501,"It's honestly fairly large, way too big for me. Was an impulse buy. The cleaning alone is a nightmare. A poor purchase, in hindsight."
1501,Make sure you don't buy more house than you can afford. My parents made that mistake.
1501,"Lesson learned, the hard way. This mansion is definitely NOT for me. Not by a long shot. I don't even live it in any longer. Which makes things worse."
1502,I assume it should be!
1502,"It should be, I am one and my email is secure so not to worry."
1502,"Well I guess that answers your question! Sorry I'm a little busy, I'm cooking a pie as we speak!"
1502,My wife made good pie. Till she left me.
1502,Why did she leave you? That's very sad!
1502,I can not think of what I did to make her go.  But she left.
1502,"My ex-wife cut my pinky toe with my razor-sharp kitchen knife before leaving me out of the blue, I believe I can understand your pain"
1502,"What!  She cut you, you mush of did something for her to do that!"
1502,"She didn't like my stew! She was a crazy one, I tell ya. I've been missing a pinky toe since that crazy day."
1502,That is crazy!  Maybe you should make a better stew.  lol
1502,"Haha, I thought the opposite of that! I haven't made a single stew since then, it's too dangerous I tell ya!"
1502,Don't blame you on that one.  I wouldn't either.
1503,Oh that's cool. I love to dance!
1503,That's cool.  Are you a dancer
1503,"I am an amaetuer dancer lol. I just learn from my favorite TV show, Dancing With The Stars."
1503,That's interesting. You must be very talented..
1503,I'm trying to be. I learn as I go.
1503,greatt. are you living with parents?
1503,No actually. I live on campus at Michigan State University. 
1503,oh that is cool
1503,Yea. Do you go to school?
1503,yes but i live with my parents..
1503,Ah ok. I love the freedom of not living with mine.
1503,yes everyone has their own perception. actually i am very close with my mum
1503,Ah how nice. Seems good for you then.
1504,"I like taking selfies showing off my strength, but I'm not sure they qualify as ""clips"""
1504,"Weightlifter, or just a work out junkie?"
1504,"Well, not professionally.  I just enjoy it a lot"
1504,Working out is great for the mind and body.
1504,"Agreed, just like traveling.  ""No one has a right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training"" as Socrates said."
1504,"I love eating healthy, but air popped popcorn is disgusting.  Rice cakes, too.  Yuck."
1504,"No argument here.  Strength is one thing, but I'm not giving up my salt, sugar, and fat."
1504,Favorite food?  
1504,"Hmm, a milkshake sounds really good right now :)"
1504,Kinda partial to floats and those icy drinks you get at McDonald's.  
1504,Floats are hit or miss to me.  Can't go wrong with root beer and vanilla but there's a lot of strange combinations people have dreamed up.
1504,Agreed.  Those Starbuck drinks are deadly.  Diabetes in a cup.
1505,"Yeah, training is a super nice market here. Lots of money to be made."
1505,I've never really done the best in casinos. I've never been the best gambler.
1505,How many times have you been to Vegas? Or have you just gambled outside of Vegas?
1505,I've never been to Vegas. I would love to go some time.
1505,It's a super nice place. It's way more than just Casinos. Lots of nice scenery in my opinion.
1505,I would love to go there for the shows more than anything. I love Penn and Teller.
1505,Oh they're so much fun. I've never actually been to a live magic show. Just seen stuff on TV.
1505,Yeah. It's fun to watch on TV but i bet it would be a lot more fun to see it in person.
1505,I very much agree. There's also just such a nice rotating slot of concerts. I've heard Brittney Spears' show in Vegas was legendary.
1505,Yeah. there are a lot of concerts and event over there. How many time have you been to vegas?
1505,"Well I've lived here for several years now, but before I had made a trip up here once for a Bachelor's Party."
1505,Nice! It is always really hot there though right? How do you deal with that crazy dry heat?
1506,Really? how tall are you?>
1506,i am around 190 cm
1506,Wow you are pretty tall. That always ok though. What do you like to do for fun?
1506,i like to travel. I have been to 26 different countries. Have you ever travelled?
1506,Yes i have. Only to a few countries in the bahamas though. I like trying to go to the movies once for twice a month though
1506,what is your favorite movie? mine is castaway
1506,I have way too many to count. How ever Castaway is a great movie. I love Tom Hanks in that film.
1506,yes he is a good actor. Very good in captain phillips and forest gump as well
1506,Ok. Maybe I could go with Forest Gump as my favorite. Or a very close to favorite atleast.
1506,what do you do for work?
1506,I am a bartender in a high end steak house. How about you?
1506,nice. I work in a publishing building as an editor
1507,i have a cat and my girlfriend lives with me but she is away at work a lot
1507,Thats is great!!1Do you have dogs as well?
1507,no I want to get a dog but they require too much attention. Do you have any pets?
1507,I have two 2 dogs and for cats
1507,where do you work?
1507,I work in  bank in a big building and you?
1507,i am a paramedic at an oil refinery
1507,Thats sounds very exciting?DO you have enough work? 
1507,yes I have worked 88 hours this week. Looking forward to my day off. And you?
1507,you must be exhausting.I was off yesterday.I did some ski
1507,very nice. I like to ski as well. Are there any good hills near you?
1507,There are some.The smokey mountain are near
1508,It definitely helped me. I got a massive new calculator which also made me happy as I love gadgets
1508,"I need a tutor, I'm finding math class way too hard lol"
1508,Nothing wrong with geting one. It definitelye saved me.
1508,"It seems like it has been a big phenomenon in recent years, but students will always have problems with math in my opinon"
1508,Math and science for sure. It also gave me time to draw after I got a tutor which was a hobby I love
1508,"OMG you love drawing too! I'm a pretty artistic soul too,if you couldn't tell by my purple hair :)"
1508,"Ah, nice. I have no hai, but yes. I love drawing. ainly comic type stuff."
1508,Comics are cool! I'm soo sorry to hear about your hair...
1508,Oh it's by choice. I keep it super short.
1508,Thats good cause some people are bald and wish they had hair.
1508,"This is true. Luckily, haven't had that problem yet"
1508,You should come over and check out my pet turtles sometime. I have two of them!
1509,are you a teacher?
1509,"Yes, I teach kids music!"
1509,very nice. I love playing guitar. what instruments do you play?
1509,I play percussion and piano.
1509,cool how long have you been a teacher?
1509,Almost four years now! What do you do for work?
1509,i am a paramedic at an oil refinery. I am here now 
1509,Oh that's awesome! Do you enjoy it?
1509,Its ok. It is very boring though. I sit in an office for 14 hours and might have to respond to one medical call
1509,"But the moments when you do respond, is it worth it?"
1509,it is very rewarding helping people that are in distress
1509,That's awesome. I'm really happy people like you do things like that.
1510,I'm going to my birthplace meet family I haven't seen in a long time.
1510,Why does that feel so scary to you? I have 3 sisters and one hasn't talked to family in a while. Might give some insight.
1510,"Well, I haven't seen them in so long I don't know exactly how things will play out."
1510,"Last time you saw them, Was everything ok relationship wise?"
1510,"It was, but I have irrational fears. For example I'm vegetarian now and I don't know how they'll take it."
1510,Theres no reason they should give you trouble over what you decide to eat. Being a paramedic i can say its a healthy diet

1511,i think i would want a ferrari
1512,i do not follow soccer. I only watch hockey
1512,I've never really gotten into hockey. I guess they are both somewhat similar. Maybe I should give it a shot!
1512,you should. Where are you from?
1512,I am from the USA. I suppose the only difference between the 2 sports is the weather and a stick...... :)
1512,soccer is more about strategy. Hockey is based on speed and skill
1512,"I live within walking distance from work. On the way, I like to practice my footwork. I'm going to be great someday!"

1514,Salad is a good choice.I prefer a mix sald with some chicken

1514,I prefer ranch is my favorite dressing with salads

1514,Thats a good choice do you like to play video games? 
1514,"Not really, I'm in my 40's and into politics and earn a good salary and like to hang out with my 2 pit bulls. My dogs are actually sweethearts."

1515,"That's awesome, I think working at home is great. Makes things so convenient."
1515,"Exactly, allows moe time as well in each day as I like to look presentable always, so makeup time etc."
1515,No one can complain about having more time in the day! I spend all my extra time learning about the latest robotics!
1515,Is that a hoby?
1515,Yea probably my only hobby to be honest. I'm pretty obsessed recently.

1520,what kind of car do you drive?
1520,A green Honda Civic. It's pretty old though. been thinking about getting a new one. What cars do you like?
1520,i like to drive cheap cars that dont break down. Right now I drive a toyota corolla
1520,That is not a bad car for the price. how long have you had it?
1520,i have had it for 7 years. But I think it will need some work soon as it has been making some strange noises
1520,Really? if that trange noise is the sounds in Africe i think that would be alright. Love the band Toto. what kind of music do you like?
1520,i like to listen to chill rock and roll. What about you?

1521,oh i know. The night almost turned extremely physical. The cops had to be called and now I have to go to court
1521,Just sing some folk music for the judge and neg for forgiveness.
1521,that sounds like a great plan. Have you ever done any hard time?
1521,"Only the one time. I was standing in line at a convenience store, when a guy behind me thought it would be ok to touch my burrito."
1521,Wow I hope you taught him a lesson. Never mess with another mans burrito
1521,"Man???? Heck, this chick don't share food with no one!!! He saw the bad side of my pistol!"
1521, Its a good thing I wasnt there. That guy would be six feet under if you catch my drift.
1521,I do! At least he didn't get my guacamole!!!
1521,well at least theres that. I hope he choked on that burrito
1521,"Man, this cheese popcorn is the bomb-diggity!!"
1522,That's a crazy job! I haven't been in the ER in ages.
1522,why did you have to go to the ER?
1522,Sorry I said I HAVEN'T been! I accredit it to my love of vegetables.
1522,I also love vegetables. My girlfriend is a vegetarian so we eat a lot of veggie meals. What does your diet consist of?
1522,I'm a vegan so I stay away from any animal products. It has caused a lot of conflict with my family.
1522,that is very admirable. I have tried to do that before but do not have the willpower
1522,Think of doing things gradually rather than having everything cut out. You can do anything you set your mind to.
1522,what is your favourite meal?
1522,My favorite meal is probably some Tofu Chicken Salad with almond nuts. How about you?
1522,i thought you were vegan? I enjoy indian food
1522,"I am vegan, it's faux 'chicken' made from tofu. They cook it a special way to give it a unique texture."
1522,ok. You should try the new beyond meat burger at A & W. its delicious
1523,i go there and ask why are you cutting down the trees?
1523,And what did they say?
1523,they say something like it disturbing me
1523,"Oh man, that's awful. I would've fought them like I used to fight my siblings."
1523,fighting with siblings will be happening in every home
1523,It's true. I had five siblings growing up. What about you?
1523,i have only 2 siblings
1523,Oh that's nice. Must have been way quieter than my house!
1523,yeah really
1523,Were you close with them? Or were you a little more distant?
1523,they are close to my heart
1523,That's great. It's always great to have your family close.
1524,Wow you are really lucky.I enjoy doing beadwork
1524,"I have never tried that before, but it sounds neat. I like to sing and hunt."
1524,Thats reaaly cool do you sing while go hunting or are more of shower singer?
1524,I actually sing at my church and kinda grew up singing as a hobby and stuff like that.

1524,I have been getting better over the years.Its a matter of discipline
1524,Have you ever considered doing it to make money? Even if it's as a second job or extra income?
1524,I have to think about.I do it really because I love it
1524,It is always good to have things we can do to enjoy. I definitely agree that not every hobby needs to be a job.
1525,me too like darjeeling tea
1525,"I love tea and all my teapots.  I have many, you?"
1525,i have only little
1525,"That's cool.  I collect them, so probably have too many. lol"

1526,"Good, remember to practice it all stages of life"
1527,"We cooked a nice, healthy meal together."
1527,"That sounds like a lot of fun. When I would get straight A's in school, we would all make homemade pizza together while listening to my favorite rapper, Yo Gotti."
1527,"Oh, I'm retired which means I have no idea who Yo Gotti is!"
1527,yo gotti is an american rapper so its a weird name for english
1527,Is he talented? The only rappers I know are The Beastie Boys!
1527,The Beastie Boys are AWESOME!! You should check out Yo Gotti sometime. He has some great stuff out there.
1527,I'll add it to the list of suggestions my grandkids have given me! Any other music recommendations?
1527,"He's really the only rapper I listen to. Other than that, I am into Texas Red Dirt music."
1527,I love me some country! Blake Shelton is one of my favorites.

1529,Thanks for lettig me know.Unfortunately I broke up with my girlfriend
1529,"I'm sorry to hear that. Being single can be really valuable, as well. We need to fall in love with ourselves before we can be good for anyone else."
1529,thats is so true.I agree with you on this one 100 %
1529,"This is my 6th response, but hang in there, and work on discovering and liking yourself in the meanwhile."

1534,A little bit of punk rock and a little bit of pop mixed with mainstream rock music.
1534,what is the meaning of punk rock?
1534,"Punk rock got big in the 70's, very fast and very abrasive with an anti-establishment message."
1534,oh ok ok
1534,I also like classic rock music. I was a fan of rap music when I was younger but not much anymore. What are you into?
1534,i like rap music
1534,Rap to me has changed so much over time. Back in the day it talked about real stuff. Today it sounds solely ego-driven to me.
1534,me too it creates a happiness
1534,I like rap that has satire. There are a bunch of dudes on the UTube that make funny rap videos.
1534,what are all the other things do you like

1535,That is very nice of you! 
1535,thank you
1535,What is your favorite color? Mine is yellow.
1536,What's your meat of choice on a pizza?
1536,I generally just like a simple pepperoni if I chose meat. The other fully loaded pizzas are a bit overloaded
1536,I completely agree. How do you feel about pineapple on pizza?
1536,I'm generally neutral. If you like pineapple on pizza then go get it. Do you have strong feelings on the matter?
1536,I firmly believe that Hawaiian pizza is one of the better pizzas. I think people disrespect it for fun.
1536,"I ate canadian bacon on english muffins this morning, I definitely see the merit in that toping. I also love olives."
1536,I can't do olives. Too weird of a flavor for me. I do like spinach on pizza though.
1536,I appreciate spinach (when well cooked) on my pizza. Pizza should be as free form as anyone wants it to be in my opinion
1536,Pizza is an art form really.
1536,"It's an art form that everyone can appreciate that, and I appreciate that fact in and of itself. Nothing brings people together like food"
1536,This is very true. You sound like a philosopher.
1536,"Ha, thanks. I guess I just like pizza enough, and I'm glad we share similar philosophies about it."
1537,I'm a professional food reviewer on youtube.
1537,That sounds cool. I bet you eat all sorts of food!
1537,"I try to experiment with many kinds , but hamburgers are definitely my favorite."
1537,I could use some burgers myself right now.
1537,Maybe I should have you guest review some sometime haha
1537,That'd be fine with me I'm always hungry.
1537,Whenever I get a full 8 hours sleep I wake up starving!
1537,"I also wake up starving, despite the midnight snack."
1537,Whenever I get a full 8 hours sleep I wake up starving!
1537,Go back to sleep!
1537,Nothing wrong with eating and enjoying food with a little exercise thrown in!
1537,Working out to make space for more food works great for me.
1538,They raise the prices of my subscriptions
1538,I cut cable a few years ago for this reason. I find what I need online most of the time.
1538,I also was on hold for more than 20 minutes and I have to hang u.I cannot be all day waiting on them for a  resolution to my problem
1538,I agree. Customer service can be terrible sometimes! I think that industry should have empathy training.
1538,They need to improve.If my fathers sees how they are keeping customer angry he will be mad after moving from India
1538,"I can imagine. It can be so frustrating. I'm a college student, but that doesn't mean I have time to waste. Always gotta study. Always gotta work."
1538,Time is money as the saying says.It never comes back and it cannot be bought
1538,"That is so true, but no matter how much things change, this stays the same: the customer has to be the focus or you lose everything."
1538,The customer is the real boss in any bussiness
1538,"Agreed. I had a boss who used to always say : ""Without customers, you don't have a business."""
1538,Agreed.Waht is your favorite color by the way.MIne is green
1538,"Pink -- like a dark, magenta shade."

1541,"I like jet fighters, F-16s and MiGs. I was a kid during the Cold War of the 80's, they were in a lot of movies."
1541,ohh..nicee
1541,I remember when the first stealth bomber was developed. That was a big deal.
1541,its really gud
1541,"Yes, the B-2 bomber is spectacular."

1543,"I have. He is really excited and a little nervous. But I still feel like i need to live up to him, even though he says I don't."
1543,Don't compare yourself to him. Always remember that success happens at different points in people's lives. 
1543,That's so true. What are some of the biggest successes you've had in your life?
1543,My biggest success would be winning a Nobel Piece Prize. What is something you are proud of ?
1543,That's great! I am proud of finally getting my college degree  and raising great kids.
1543,"Congratulations on graduating college, it takes persistence and I wish you the very best!"
1543,"Thanks a lot. It took ten years, but I am just glad I finally completed it!"
1543,Wow ten years! That is inspirational!!
1543,I think getting a Nobel Peace Prize is also massively inspriati
1543,Thank you!!
1543,Oh no... Typo. Sorry. *Inspirational.
1543,"It is okay , I understood haha. It happens to the best of us"
1544,"Throw in some black, and you've really got a party!!! Haha"
1544,"I created a meme series called ""Purple Potato, Rustled Jimmies"" it had crazy characters in it and mainly just made fun of Facebook."
1544,That sounds interesting. How successful was it?
1544,"I made about 40 memes starring Zuck, Rachel Madcow, Grimace for Mcd's, Barney the dinosaur, Pootie Tang, the dumbest thing ever created."
1544,"Interesting. Besides making memes, what do you do?"
1544,"I have two adopted kids, am a yoga instructor, and run a property management business. How about yourself?"
1544,"I recently opened a craft store, I am co-director of our EMS service, and I have 3 teenagers. It sounds like you are just as busy as I am!"
1544,"I stay busy, making dumb jokes that only I and a few other people get is one of my releases. I've recently written a stand-up routine."
1544,That is great! Do you think you will ever perform?
1544,"In this day and age it will be tough. It's stuff I wrote on Facebook before I was 30 banned for every post. It's completely anti-PC, but funny."
1544,"That stuff would be a hit, given the right crowd!"
1544,"I agree 100%, I have a Harambe bit, a Kennedy family bit, a bunch or personal stories, have lived a colorful life."
1544,I can tell! Good luck in your adventures!
1544,Thank you very much.
1545,you kow a lot about Ducatis
1545,"yes, I do"
1545,do you have any other hobbies?
1545,"yes, I do. what about you?"
1545,I love damcing in a group and I also love country muic
1545,cool. I love reading here. I am not good dancer
1545,reading is awesome.You learn a lot of things
1545,yes i do. I read mostly on technologies
1545,What interesting thing have you learn? 
1545,A lot. Do you about artificial intelligent
1545,I have heard somethign about it?do you you?
1545,yes i do. Really love the concept behind it
1546,Thank you. I hope I do as well. It was a Christmas present from my mom.
1546,ok then. do you still have it now
1546,"Yes, he is somewhere in the house"
1546,ok then. You sounding as if you don't like it
1546,"To be honest, I am not the biggest fan of hamsters. However, my mom didn't know that."
1547,I have not. I like to spend my time helping out at the soup kitchens and supporting the homeless.
1547,"That is a very noble thing to support. I'm in college, so I don't have much free time to spend volunteering. "
1547,I just keep thinking that it could happen to anyone at anytime. I would like to think that someone would be there for me.
1547,I'm sure they would be. Do you like to watch cartoons? I love them. 
1547,"I do! My favorite is Chowder. Have you ever been out of the country? I have not, but I hope to some day."
1547,"Yes, I have. The farthest places I have been are Australia and New Zealand. Where do you want to go?"
1547,I would love to see Italy some day.
1547,I would love to go to Italy. I have never been to Europe. 
1547,You said that you are in college. What are you studying?
1547,I am studying psychology. Did you go to college?
1547,"I did, but I did not finish. I moved a lot and my credits didn't transfer. I went for nursing and ended up in the EMS field instead. No regrets!"
1547,That's awesome. A great profession!
1547,I love it!
1548,He was very rude to me with no reason at all.
1548,"You said ""late again"".   Does he always make you late for work?"
1548,"No, That was another reason i late for work."
1548,I know being late is stressful.  Maybe make a second set of keys?
1548,Yes! It is very good idea!
1548,"I'm glad you think so.  That's what I had to do, also."
1548,Can you give me more advice about how can i stop to late work?
1548,Yes.  I used to help my younger brothers get to their after school jobs on time.
1548,Please! Give me some. I would be very grateful.
1548,I would get one of those electronic devices that will help you find your keys.
1548,What electronic devices? Will you be more specific?.
1549,You and me both...there's no laws when you're drinking them claws!
1549,"You know, Ive never been out of my home town, all the tailgaiting parties Ive been to happened here "
1549,"That's a shame, honestly. It's always such a pleasant experience getting to do some tailgaiting on foreign soil. Never know who's going to destroy a folding table."
1549,Right? I think there are also many fun tailgating parties here. Im just afraid to ride a plane.  
1549,"If that's your life ambition is to have the ultimate tailgating experience, then travel is a must. I recommend Baton Rouge, definitely. And Buffalo, apparently."
1549,"Those are some great reccomendations, Thanks !!! "
1549,Of course! Have you got any favorite towns to recommend?
1549,"I love Miami, FL and Orlando. Thats where Ive been. What do else do you like doing?"
1549,"I enjoy singing a great deal. Mostly in the shower, rarealy among others."
1549,"wow , that's really cool ! i do not even try to sing in the shower . . ."
1549,"It takes a great deal of courage, I have to admit!"
1549,Yeah haha. My favorite singer is Jo Stafford. Do you have a favorite?
1550,I'll have to check him out on youtube then! 
1550,What do you do for a living?
1550,I am a teacher
1550,Very cool. I'm in marketing. Do you teach a specific subject?
1550,"Marketing wow! What got you interested in Marketing? Also, I teach the Korean Language."
1550,"I love that marketing is the art of persuasion. It makes one feel powerful, in a sense."
1551,"Yes, maybe I can send another opportunity his way."
1551,would there be a way to reschedule the meeting?
1551,"That meeting is done.  However, the next meeting will be coming up soon and I will invite my coworker."
1551,"good deal, was there another opportunity as well?"
1551,"Yes.  We sell athletic equipment, so there are always more potential clients."
1551,nice! do you use any of your company's products?
1551,Yes.  I run every morning in the newest model of athletic shoes and lift weights after work.
1551,"that's a good perk, running shoes can be expensive... do you ever run with a partner?"
1551,There's another runner that I race sometimes.  I'm pretty fast so I usually win.
1551,i'm working on finishing up a contract painting but would be open to running with you sometime
1551,"OK, that sounds great.  i'll bring along a pair of our newest athletic shoes for you."
1551,that would be awesome! i'm a size 11 1/2
1552,"Did you know that they will hide almost anywhere...light fixtures, electrical outlets, and they're so small!"
1552,Yes! Snakes do the same thing. It's weird. I'm not scared of bugs but snakes terrify me!
1552,"Snakes....yikes! Wouldnt want to be caught dead within 100 miles of one, let alone a few feet. Hard pass!"
1552,"Yes! Even though my favorite color is red, there's no way I'd want a red tailed boa near me."
1552,"Hah! Everytime I think of ""boa"", I'm reminded of the flowery thing that the flapper-type women wore around their necks in the 1930's."
1552,Those feathered boas were so great though! I can remember playing dress up with one when I was younger.
1552,"They certainly had their heyday....and let's be honest, I would much rather those than an ACTUALY boa around my neck."
1552,Lol exactly! There's no way I'd want a snake even touching me!
1552,"The scales, the sliminess, the crawling....nope. Not having any of it! Even when I'm riding my bike, one crosses my path and I'm gone!"
1552,I don't even like to ride in a car and pass one by! I understand your feelings!
1552,"Perhaps they're a bit over the top and extreme, but it's nice to know that someone else shares my sentiments."
1552,Hahaha me too! I've always been afraid of them!
1553,"I do weightlifting. But, I actually prefer calisthenics. "
1553,I'm only 19 so I'm just getting into lifting weights.
1553,Do you have a favorite exercise?
1553,not really. Just a lot of benching for now. Do you have a favorite?
1553,Nice! I would say my favorite is Bur-pees. 
1553,Those are intense sometimes. What's the most you've lifted?
1553,300 is the most I have lifted. How about you?
1553,"man, that's awesome. I only weigh 150 so I'm only at 100. "
1553,"Thanks, I am training to be the hulk at this point lol. 100 is a lot as well. Keep up the good work!"
1553,Thanks. You into any sports? I'm a huge fan of baseball.
1553,"Cool, who is your favorite team? I'm actually a fan of tennis."
1553,I have my eyes on the Astros right now. They played a close game tonight.
1554,oh. i understood
1554,"Jason Mraz is not just a singer either, he is also a songwriter."
1554,so he is a very good artist 
1554,"Yes, he's also a good songwriter, choreographer, and producer too."
1554,he is a multi talented person
1554,That he is. Who is your favorite singer or artist?
1554,taylor swift and shawn mendes
1554,"Oh okay, nice. Im assuming you are female right?"
1554,yes. you are right
1554,"Well that makes since then. Do you like the book series ""Twilight""?"
1554,Yes! I like it very much I had read the book as well as watched the movie series also.
1554,I love the books. Very good. Do you have any questions for me?
1554,By the way what is your favourite movie?
1555,Drinking is great. I also love to bake cakes. It's my favorite pastime. 
1555,If I'm not drinking I start to think about drinking and thinking makes me uncomfortable.
1555,"That's funny. I don't like thinking much either. Luckily, I just started a new job at an advertising agency so I mostly just think about work stuff right now. "
1555,"When I think about advertising, I think about drinking and realize I'm not drinking and then I get uncomfortable."
1555,What do you like to drink the most?
1555,"I like drinking beer and bourbon, some Fireball sometimes, as long as it's booze and will keep me from thinking about not drinking."
1555,I tend to think about sad stuff when I drink a lot. Have you had that experience?
1555,"The key to proper drinking is not thinking, that's why I drink not to think."
1555,I suppose I haven't been doing it properly then. You must have been drinking a long time because you seem very experienced. 
1555,"Yes, and I love group meetings, because we all just want to drink, and we all just end up drinking again. Don't be depressed, just get loaded. "
1555,"Wow, those meetings sound so uplifting. "
1555,They never made sense to me. Why put someone trying to quit something around others with the same desires to use?
1556,"Oh, I suppose it'll be alright. I'm sure there's another lab out there somewhere who will hire me. Family seems to be taking it well, for now."
1556,"That's great to hear. You know, if you need to relax, you're welcome to go bird watching with me this weekend!"
1556,"I may just have to take you up on that. The last time we went, it was almost a surreal experience, I enjoyed it greatly!"
1556,"And if you're looking for something part time, the library is hiring! I'm the librarian now, so I can probably hook you up!"
1556,The library? I hadnt considered that possiblity. Are the hours okay? And I'm sure the atmosphere is akin to bird-watching....peaceful.
1556,It's very peaceful! I'm pretty calm with my job and my hobbies lol. Do you think it'll take long to find another job?
1556,"I sure hope not. I have enough savings for a month....maybe two. Then, I'm in trouble."
1556,I understand that completely. Saving money is hard! 
1556,"Very much so....especially with a family of 5. Every penny goes to the dinner table or the house note, so it seems."
1556,Every penny is taken somewhere here too!
1556,"It's nice to know that someone else understands my plight. Half the time, the money is gone before I ever get a chance to earn it."
1556,I've always said that my check is gone before it ever touches the bank lol. I definitely know the feeling!
1557,"Yes.  Actually, I did finally conceive and she just graduated from high school.  "
1557,that's amazing! how quickly time flies yeah?
1557,Yes.  I was really nervous when she started driving.  I've had two crashes and it scares me.
1557,"i hope you weren't hurt too badly, i too have had a couple of crashes... "
1557,"Well, I try to walk as much as possible anyway.  It helps me stay fit for softball."
1557,"i also like to walk, i'm not working at the moment so i have all day to do it - lol"
1557,Isn't it great in the morning to get out of the house and feel the sun and cool air?
1557,yes! and the quiet before everyone starts to hustle & bustle!!
1557,"My daughter joins me, since she plays softball also.  I'm so glad we didn't give up on having children."
1557,"i'd like to have kids one day, my wife and i are going through a bit of a rough patch though..."
1557,Hope it works out. Having kids is much easier with teamwork.
1557,thanks! it would be wonderful to share common hobbies with them and watch them grow
1558,"Either that,  or they just don't care."
1558, they think with money they have it all .
1558,I sometimes wonder what it would be like. Being rich with no cares in the world. Only worried about what shoes to wear that day....
1558,Right! It would be a dream come true to shop and not have to look at the price tag.
1558," I just wonder if that is why they are so cold, emotionally. Is it because they don't have to care about anything else?"
1558,"I think it's something that develops in their personality psychology, but can be for many reasons such as being lonely."
1558,"I suppose that money would fill a void. I think if I had to choose, I'd be comfortable, not wealthy."
1558,I would prefer that as well. Although I find money provides freedom generally and that makes happiness and healthiness easier.
1558,"That is absolutely true! I hate that money, fame, and material things change people. Stuff dictates the world."
1558,"Indeed. It's quite sad, but it's nice to see them pull themselves up and change the world!"
1558,"This is true. I just hate seeing some of them who have enough money to make a difference, but not the humanity to do it."
1558,"I SO agree!! They could literally pay it forward,but choose not to."
1559,ha ha. My daughter just entered college. Im right behind you.
1559,Thats awesome though.  I didn't graduate until I was 40 something
1559,Thats amazing. Its never to late you know.
1559,"so true, it's much easier when you're younger but like they always say it's better late than never!"
1559,I agree. I graduated when i was 28 so i know what you mean.
1559,What collage did you attend? I was at Duke University
1559,I went to UH. University of Houston.
1559,I love Texas! I actually did a triathlon in Houston 
1559,Oh thats cool. Really hot down here most of the time though. Where do you reside now?
1559,"I love in Norman, Oklahoma. What about you? "
1559,I still live in Texas. About an hour out of Houston. 
1559,"Like i said before, I love Texas. Such a great place"
1560,I'm actually looking to go there now that I've graduated college.
1560,I have connections if you're looking for a job! My brother in law runs a pretty big Hollywood Studio!
1560,"That would be nice, but I never considered moving there."
1560,"Ah, okay! Well, a visit would be nice. I'd like to show you the shop that I work out of. "
1560,Oh what kind of shop is it?
1560,We do custom aquariums. It's a pretty neat set up.
1560,Oh that's neat. How big do they get?
1560,"We've done them the size of a deck of cards, all the way up to mermaid tanks for huge theme parks. "
1560,Oh okay so they vary a lot.
1560,They do! What kind of degree did you graduate with?
1560,I graduated with a degree in computer science actually.
1560,That's great! Technology is a great field to get into.
1561,"I like rap but my mom won't let me listen to it, I'm only 8 yrs old"
1561,"oh sorry, yeah might be best to way a bit. there is some child-appropriate stuff out there but it might be hard to find"
1561,"I'm into comic books, I really love them. "
1561,"that's cool. i sometimes read web comics, i got a new keyboard that makes scrolling through them very comfortable "
1561,that's nice
1561,it's important to find a keyboard that works well without causing strain on your wrists
1561,"i see, don't want to hurt your wrists"
1561,you can really cause permanent damage. a good chair is important too if you don't want to hurt your back 
1561,ok so what other key points do you want to tell me? are you a big or small computer?
1562,Yes! In some circumstances They might do it.
1562,I guess that's what happens being a company man and all. I just fish and hunt.
1562,Nothing to do with this! I have to deal with this.
1562,"You just said they were allowed to do this. So what's your complaint, they breaking a contract?"
1562,I am not complaining! Just Saying and they are not breaking the contract.
1562,"So when you are a company man, the company's gonna tell you what you can and can't do on occasion. Either quit or pick a new vacation time."
1562,Yes! I understood. By the way what is your favourite colour?
1562,We huntin' and fishin' folk spell it color......and I like black and yellow. Red is good too.
1562,Nice choice!
1562,The dude locked in my closet is a fan of blue and green. That's why he's locked in the closet.
1562,Hahaha! Very funny!
1562,"Thank you sir, my previous statement was my best try at an attempt at cannibalism humor....which we also spell differently."
1563,"Yeah, I've been feeling lonely lately, but it has helped a lot."
1563,"I understand. I have been lonely for quite a bit here as of late. But, it's going to turn around here soon. That's my hope."
1563,"Sorry about that, I hope things get better for you. Do you have any plans for the next few days?"
1563,"Haven't got much in the way of plans yet. It's my day off, so sleeping in is a likely scenario."
1563,"That's cool. I was hoping to go job hunting, do you know if anyone is hiring right now?"
1563,"Not in my neck of the woods.  If I'd have researched the job market here, I may have decided to go to medical school instead!!"
1564,why are you taking the medicine again?
1564,i am having trouble sleeping
1564,Has something been bothering you lately?
1564,no not really i just get so restless to sleep at night
1564,"Well in that case, I am glad to hear the medicine is working."
1564,yeah but i don't want to be on it for to long
1564,"Which is understandable. Have you tried natural practices, like meditation?"
1564,yeah but it is not as effective as the drug
1564,"Right probably not. I've suffered from insomnia myself, so I can relate."
1565,I'm the same way! That's my favorite thing to do on summer break! I love summer concert time!
1565,I love attending country concerts the most. They are my favorite. What concerts are your favorite?
1565,Country! I don't get to go to many with the way college is. This newest internship is killing me!
1565,"Yeah, I know what you mean. My job doesn't allow me to spend much time with my family and friends. Wish I could see them more. "
1565,"Yeah, me too. I keep telling myself that it's all gonna be worth it when I finally walk across the stage with my doctorate!"
1565,It definitely will be worth it. Do you play any sports? I miss playing golf with my friends. Haven't played in awhile. 
1565,I do tennis on occasion. I haven't golfed in a long time! We need to catch up one day and play a couple holes together!
1565,That sounds great! I would love to play sometime. How is everything else going?
1565,"Ah, same old same old. I'm back on 16 hour rounds at the hospital. We'd been doing 12 on, 12 off, but this week it switched."
1565,"Wow, that sounds exhausting. I don't know how you do it. I don't do well with no sleep. "
1565,I've gotten used to basically sleeping while I'm standing up. How have you been?
1565,"I'm well mostly, but ready for Fall to come."
1565,Thanks for chatting with me :)
1566,I plan to see them in concert when they come to town.
1566,they are great live! living in chicago I have seen them many times
1566,Do they do a laser show or anything spectacular like that?
1566,"mostly just basic lighting, but they have so much energy in person that doesn't come through in their recordings"
1566,It helps me in my work to stay up on the underground groups.  I get a better grip on teen mindsets.
1566,that's cool - do you work closely with kids?
1566,I'm a school psychologist.  So I have to be aware of their outside influences.  
1566,"very true, i bet you get a chance to make a big difference in their lives - must be very rewarding!"
1566,"Yes, and stressful.  I play piano to relax.  I understand Rise Against has endorsed one of Vans shoes.  "
1567,Im an okay cook. Far from a professional though.
1567,it takes time to learn and lots of patience. a lot like learning how to play an instrument
1567,An instrument? Lol. I dont know how to play any instrument.
1567,my mom was a music teacher so i got to learn from a very young age. but it's never too late to start!
1567,True but i think im a pass on learning that lol.
1567,yeah it's not for everyone. do you like movies?
1567,"I do yes, you?"
1567,"yeah, i just saw Last of the Mohicans for the first time last weekend and i think it's my favorite movie"
1567,Ive een it too. It is a very good movie.
1567,what is your favorite movie?
1567,"A movie call ""Pay It Forward"". Have you seen it?"
1567,"yes i have, very inspirational"
1568,I never try this! Do you?
1568,It is fun to go target shooting
1568,Ooh!! Interesting!
1568,is she a hunter?
1569,"I miss the tacos, man they are dope"
1569,Those are really good. I am more of a burrito man myself.
1569,I can get down with burritos too bro
1569,"I prefer them the authentic way, wrapped in a corn tortilla."
1569,guac or no guac?
1569,Guac for sure
1569,you smoke weed?
1569,"No, I'm broke"
1569,hahaha broke people love weed i thought
1569,"haha, you got me there"
1569,you want a job ?
1569,"definitely, and hopefully I'll get one soon"
1570,well i know it takes time to find a hobby that interests you. I collect coins myself
1570,"I love coins too! I primarily do stamps now, but I still have my collection of mercury dimes!"
1570,nice. what else do you like to do for fun? I play baseball on a team and coach a local boys team.
1570,Aww that's great! I do a lot of weekend concerts! 
1570,thats cool. I love live music but don't usually have the time to go to as many concerts as I would like.
1570,I wish I could go to them all lol. I'll have to come to one of your games sometime! 
1570,that would be cool. we have a great group of guys this year. We are traveling to Las Vegas in a few weeks for a tourney.
1570,"Oh that sounds like fun! Are you going to get to explore much while you're there, or is it straight business only?"
1570,a bit of both - going to play to win of course but what fun is Vegas without some down time? 
1570,"Exactly! If you make a ton, remember me lol"
1570,ha! I'll try to do that. LOL
1570,Good luck on your tournament as well! I hope you guys do really well!
1571,I had to put quite a lot of work into studying. but it was worth it
1571,"Then it was worth it, even if it was arduous."
1571,I study better at night. I seem to have my most motivation and clear thinking thne
1571,What about day studying? how do you find that?
1571,I tend to become distracted during the day. Too many things happening. do you work better during the day?
1571,"Night for me,I agree daytime is likely to cause more distractions but I feel music helps to have in the backgrou\nd, you?"
1572,Yeah. What are some of your hobbies?
1572,"well i just did try-outs for baseball and i got selected for starting shortstop, pretty excited about that"
1572,Really? Wow. Thats great. What type of league is it?
1572,it's our community college team so not really a big deal lol. i'm only 19
1572,I see. Well i bet it will be fun anyways.
1572,are there model airplane competitions?
1572,Yes. Many of them. Some pay good money too if you win.
1572,"sounds interesting, i might look some up on youtube"
1572,"Yes, its much more interesting then it seems."
1572,"i've seen some of the drone races where people fly from the first-person view, very intense"
1572,Ive done that too. Its very fun and definitely a thrill.
1572,how many aircraft do you own?
1573,Thats really good. I would like country music to be played at my wedding
1573,What song ?
1573,"I'm not sure, i will have to ask my fiance, although i haven't proposed yet"
1573,Well I like reading and I'm pretty sure their is a book that has all the greatest love songs.
1573,sounds like a great book. I will have to have a look in the library
1573,"If nothing else you could always go with Dolly Parton's I will always love you, sorry... just really love country music! "
1573,"Thats a good choice, didnt Whitney Houston sing that too?"
1573,"She remade it yes...better than Dolly! I think her best remake is that new one, higher love. I think it's Peter Gabriel but could be wrong."
1573,"I remember that song, was a classic"
1573,Ahh no it was Steve Winwood...you must have grown up in the 80s too?
1573,ah yes i couldnt envisage who sang it
1573,it was on the tip of my tongue but I couldn't remember until I pressed send. Well anyway good luck with the proposal. How are you going to do it?
1574,"I like toppings on my pizza.......all kinds of toppings, except pineapple and anchovies which don't belong on pizza."
1574,"Doesn't matter what a meme tells you...anyone who likes pineapple on a pizza is not a normal human being, end of conversation! lol"
1574,"I am with you 100%, am a meme maker myself, made the dumbest meme series in the history of the modern world. It truly puzzled individuals."
1574,"That, in my opinion, is a successful meme. It doesn't have to be tangible, or even relatable....baffle and astound. That's where it's at!"
1574,"I did around 40 in my ""Purple Potato, Rustled Jimmies"" series, want to put them all on a poster so people can stare and WTF?"
1574,Andy Warhol your memes.....it would be truly impressive.
1574,"That's the idea, Facebook shut me down because my work focuses on clowning about them. I also spoke very loudly."
1574,"Speaking loudly or ""offensively"" on Facebook lands you in Facebook jail.....meals are terrible, climate control inoperative, and Bubba wants to give skiing lessons."
1574,"30 days on the reg......and I'm a male transitioned to female at the age of 17, yeah, not on social media any longer."
1574,"Understandably so. Live and let live, I say. The level of sensitivity that folks as a whole have devolved to nowadays is troubling at best, laughable at worst."
1574,"That's why I do comedy, love ya', You have to laugh at our society of hysterics. Don't Tread on Me because I ain't gonna tread on you. "
1574,"Multiple levels and varieties of outcasts in our society, all of them needlessly so. Folks missed the talk about inclusion in kindergarten, likely too busy eating the glue."
1575,yeah i feel very happy for that 
1575,what type of laptop did you get? I hope its a very nice one. 
1575,DELL
1575,thats cool. I have a Dell desktop and a Dell laptop. 
1575,DELL laptop its a nice laptop
1575,yeah I've been happy with mine. i think its time for me to upgrade though
1575,what type do you have 
1575,its a Dell too. but I just need something newer
1575,waoo that nice so when will you upgrade 
1575,Pretty soon. I need a new phone too. Thinking about a Samsung Galaxy.
1575,when did buy it
1575,I have an iPhone now but looking for something better. 
1576,I just got divorced
1576,How do you feel now
1576,like joining the theater!
1576,awesome haha
1576,Did your parents do anything crazy (like buying a dream car) after the divorce?
1576,Yea they did actually
1576,really?  I'd love to buy a corvette!
1576,you should go for it ! they are excellent cars
1576,Do you have one?
1576,"yes its a 2017 corvette , i love it ! what kind of car do you have"
1576,Jealous!  Nothing that nice yet...
1576,Well I hope one day you get what you want :)
1577,Maybe you left food in it. Have you tried leaving food on another part of the camp ground to distract them?
1577,"ha ! great tactic , i will try that ."
1577," If you can't get your tent back, you could stay with me and my family if you want. We have an RV."
1577,"An RV is great!  We don't have a lot of money to help out with, though.  Are you sure it would be ok?"
1577,"No, it's fine, I don't mind helping out. I have my young kids staying, would that be an issue for you?"
1577,"Of course not.  Thank you for the help, we appreciate it!  Does your family like yoga?"
1577,"My wife is into it, but I've never tried it before. I play a lot of basketball, do you think it would help me?"
1577,"Maybe.  If you're fit, it will definitely help.  Yoga helps us to stay in shape and relax."
1577,"Yeah, maybe I should try it. Who else do you have staying with you?"
1577,"Just my kids.  We don't have money for an RV, so we usually just have a tent.  We like to hike too.  Do you like to hike?"
1577,"Yeah! It's why we came here, too. It's pretty out of the way, but the nature here is great. It's too bad there are so many bears."
1577,I agree. I'm sad about our tent. We can't afford a new one.  Thanks for letting us stay with you.  Let's find a great trail!
1578,yeah i wonder if this vegan thing will ever catch on
1578,I think it's catching on pretty quickly! I see a lot more of it online!
1578,Even Mcdonalds now has a burger made of veggies
1578,I saw that! I think it was an ad online. I spend waaaay too much time online lol. 
1578,"you should get outside more, the real world is outside and the internet is a strange place"
1578,Oh I agree with you there! It's so crazy how I'd rather get a text now than a phone call. Fifteen years ago it was unheard of
1578,ever been in a fist fight?
1578,"When I was young and dumb, absolutely."
1578,i used to fight people in hockey all the time
1578,That's something I've never done! Hockey always looked too rough for me.
1578,yeah but now im a vegan
1578,That's great for you! I've heard the health benefits are so great.
1579,"i have a three-year old so no heated pools for now, maybe someday "
1579,Maybe someday for me too.  I need to learn how to swim first.
1579,"never too late to learn, how old are you?"
1579,I'm 22.  I'm busy with school and my band.  We're a rock band.
1579,got any gigs coming up?
1579,I guess.  We are kind of a house band for a local bar.  
1579,"good to have a reliable venue, gives you a chance to try out new things with a crowd you're familiar with"
1579,Yep.  That's true and ya don't have to load stuff up all the time.  What do you like musically?
1579,"well, i like a lot of rap but since i'm a first grade teacher with a three year old i have to be careful what i listen to "
1579,Hee.  I suppose that's true.  Do you play an instrument?
1579,yeah i play piano and some bass guitar
1579,Cool.  I bet your 3 year old keeps you busy.  I'm not there yet.
1580,I wasnt paying my rent and had to take out a loan
1580,Where you being reminded to pay your rent?
1580,"Ive got it covered now, but the landlord kept coming around asking to pay up"
1580,Thats good that you have it covered now. Removes a weight from your shoulders. Was the landlord understanding?
1580,He was once i told him i'd have the outstanding amount paid off in a few weeks!
1580,That's wonderful. It always feels good to pay off debt I think.
1580,Its going to feel amazing
1580,"It totally will, I can guarantee it. It will give you a feeling of freedom again. "
1580,"Exactly, and i'll be able to start getting back to my pottery"
1580,You enjoy pottery? im not very good with that kind of thing. Sport is more for me
1580,"Its enjoyable and relaxing, although i've only progressed to making ashtrays so far"
1580,You have to start somewhere. Some day you will be making magnificent pots. How long have you been doing it?
1581,"maybe after i get settled, i'm moving there in a couple of months"
1581,I'm glad you figured it out.  Do they have any activities you especially like?
1581,yes! being on the ocean there are all kinds ow water sports
1581,"And where there's salt water and youths, there are great fast food shops.  My favorite is pizza."
1581,there's nothing like a hot pizza right out of the oven! being close to Mexico they also have great tacos!!
1581,Does your boyfriend live on base or have an apartment?
1581,he lives on base
1581,I guess at least you will get to see him on his days off.
1581,yes! he's just south of downtown so going there is a breeze
1581,He must be thrilled you are moving out there.  Military life can be so lonely.
1581,"long distance relationships can be tough, but he has a good group of friends."
1581,That's great to hear.  Hope everything goes smoothly for you.  
1581,thanks!
1582,"I babysit for my next door neighbor, she loves yellow."
1582,i babysit for my neighbor
1582,We have that in common. Yellow and black are the best combination of colors.
1582,Like beige and brown?
1582,Beige and brown are too similar. Yellow and black just look good together.
1582,"I see,  Did you have different colors in your room as a kid?"
1582,"red, white and blue"
1582,like the american flag!
1582,"Exactly, I wear yellow and black and fly red, white and blue......the best combinations."
1582,You sound extremely artistic with a strong color palette  
1582,I just wear colors that represent what I stand for and they happen to stand for great things.
1582,Maybe its time to launch your art career full time.
1583,i typically don't have many vegetables in my house. No one eats them
1583,Do you eat them? I love vegetables! 
1583,well we are vegetarian but no one cooks - we eat out quite a bit. No sense buying food if its going to go bad right?
1583,"So true, what's a staple vegetarian meal for you then?"
1583,i love things like eggplant lasagna. 
1583,"Lasagne is great, could I try yours sometime?"
1583,sure. I normally don't cook but I can get some from the smoothie place I work at. Its a veg restaurant too
1584,it can definitely be bad to hold yourself to one standards without maintaining some flexibility
1584,This is true. But it can also be bad to hold yourself to no standards. Standards are important
1584,"yep. my daughter holds herself to a very high standard and just graduated top of her class, but i worry that she's too obsessive about grades"
1584,Thats great to hear. Its good to care about your grades. but caring to much can be a concern. Have you mentioned it to her?
1584,"yeah, she says that at university she is going to try some extracurricular stuff to try and branch out from just grades"
1584,"Cool, I hope she continues to be successful. It's good you are encouraging her!"
1584,"i met my wife through extracurricular activities and now we work together, so doing stuff outside of class can even be good for a career"
1584,I spend most of my time working. which leaves little time for other activities. 
1584,what kind of work do you do?
1584,I work in IT. And like to have everything done as it should be. kind of a perfectionist. How about you?
1584,we run an NGO that specializes in integration for refugees and asylum seekers
1584,Thats great. you must meet so many people doing that?
1585,"You know, my church missionary group mentioned that!"
1585,It's so fun! We have a group that goes out for pizza after salsa dancing.  Pizza is my favorite.
1585,"I do too! Frozen pizza seems to be pretty popular at the church food pantry, too! We give a lot of it away."
1585,Frozen pizza can also be delicious. It's really great that you are so active in the church.  You should have a salsa dance group!
1585,"Oh, I'm getting too old for that lol. With 2 of our kids gone on to Heaven, I mostly just stay at home. "
1585,I'm sorry to hear that.  Salsa dancing would be a great way to get out and have some fun.  I just bought new hoop earrings for next week!
1585,I might just take you up on that! What kind of hoops did you get? I love a rose gold earring.
1585,They are sliver.  They go great with my outfit for dancing.  I hope you join us!  You'd love it.
1585,Is it fast paced? I might need a beginner class.
1585,"It's just for fun.  We'll teach you how to salsa!  You don't need to be skilled, it's all about having a great time."
1585,"Oh, that's great! What time does the class start?"
1585,"Well, it's not a class.. just a group of us that go to a club.  We'll meet around 7pm this Friday.  "
1586,haha why do you like Taylor Swift so much? I always found her a bit annoying
1586,"I think that Taylor swift is actually amazing, she is my guilty pleasure."
1586,I'm more of a rock fan to be honest. I went to some great gigs in college. I've just graduated last week actually
1586,way more impressive ! Congrats! What did you major in?
1586,I studied veterinary sciences. I really like looking after animals. Do you have any pets? 
1586,Nice! I actually just adopted a Yorkie two weeks ago. Sweetest pup ever
1586,Aww cute. I’d love to get a dog but with the baby coming I don’t think it would be very safe. 
1586,Omg Double congrats! How far along are you?
1586,"My girlfriend is six months pregnant, so not long to go now. So excited and nervous!"
1586,How precious!!
1586,Yeah it’s our first child so it’ll be a rollercoaster of emotions. Have you got kids?
1586,"Oh for sure,but its all worth it:) and I have 5 (one on the way)and a dog haha"
1587,"Yes, there's a big ""awareness"" now about student loans."
1587,Yes! High School kids have no idea what they're getting in to.
1587,I'm not far from them.  I'm a full-time student in a major I'm not sure about.
1587,What major are you currently working on?
1587,Computer science but I don't want to end up like my mom working a deadend job intelco.
1587,Isn't there so many opportunities for computer stuff though?
1587,Yep. But I really want to play music.  Tough to make a living doing that. What do you do?
1587,I'm a waitress
1587,"May the tips be with you.  Sorry, that's corny.  I tip well if I can."
1587,"Haha!  That's nice of you!  not everyone tips well, or at all."
1587,That's not cool.  What kind of restaurant is it?
1587,Diner type.  Milkshakes and burgers.
1588,I have never ran into them where I'm from.
1588,Where abouts are you from?
1588,"Right now I live in Canada but was born in London, England."
1588,"Well you should be ok if you make sure you keep your distance, i have a pet skunk, and they only spray when they feel threatened"
1588,"I will try to keep that in mind if I ever run into one again, thanks for the tip!"
1588,You're more than welcome! What made you move to canada?
1588,Well.. unfortunately my parents passed away in a car accident not too long ago so I decided to get a new start.
1588,Ah im sorry to hear that. Canada is a beautiful palce to get a new start!
1588,Thank you and it has been quite nice so far. I'm scared of how cold the winter might be 
1588,"Just make sure you wear something warm when you go out, it should be fine. I much prefer being cold that warm, i would love to move there someday!"
1588,Wear something warm OR hide inside where it's nice and toasty! Maybe you should give it a try some day!
1588,"See thats also an option! I would try it, but i'd have to see if i can get my skunk through customs!"
1588,Tell them its a therapy skunk!
1589,"No, but I will.  I love spending a good deal of money on fun activities."
1589,me too! i go to festivals quite often.
1589,My favorite thing is taking lots of pictures.
1589,nice! do you own a high end camera?
1589,Yes.  I have all the extras also.  So I have to keep my credit in good standing.
1589,"yeah, those lenses can get pricey!"
1589,I also spend a lot of time and money on water sports.
1589,what kind of water sports?
1589,"Surfing, skiing, hang gliding, you name it."
1589,awesome! i'm going body surfing tomorrow!
1589,I have to be sure to set calendar alerts so I can pay on time from now on.
1589,"that is a good thing to do. my bank has an online setting that sends out a statement email, helps a lot!"
1590,"Really a fast food place that sells alcohol this seems like my kind of city, did they tell you about any of the local hot spots."
1590,"No, i think some of the big casinos are where its at. Paris Casino is meant to be impressive"
1590,"Oh ok cool, I'm going down there to meet my birth mother and my siblings i don't know and I just wanted to know some fun place to go."
1590,vegas is fun to visit but not to live there - i think it would be too much
1590,"Yea I don't know why she choose there, but I'm excited nonetheless seems like it's the city that never sleeps."
1590,Well it seems like a place everyone should check out!
1590,"Yea I'm pretty excited, I even wanna go to that pawn shop, that's on the show Pawn Stars and meet the dad and his son."
1590,"You can go out at any time and get food, drink or entertainment. Each casino is like a different world"
1590,"Yea I heard, but I don't wanna gamble to much I'm so scared to lose all of my money and look silly."
1590,"Yeah and to gamble you need consideration but then there is risk, you rely on chance and the last thing you hope for of course is the prize."
1590,Yea well it was great chatting with you and wish me luck at the casinos 
1590,"Haha thank you, and have fun if you do!"
1591,gaming laptop?
1591,"I have two, actually. One is a gaming laptop and the other I use for school."
1591,"i might buy a dedicated gaming laptop someday, right now i mostly use mine for work-related stuff"
1591,"Same here. When my grandparents passed, they left me their laptop that they used. I use it mostly for work and school."
1591,"it's good to get second-hand consumer electronics, saves money and it's a good way to avoid waste"
1591,Yes! I have a habit of picking up seemingly broken electronics and fixing them to resell! A lot of times the fix is simple!
1591,"great way of helping the environment, i try to do what i can in that regard. fortunately i live close enough to my work that i can walk there"
1591,"That's a great thing! Not only does it save on carbon emissions, it saves on money!"
1591,"yep, no car means no insurance payments which means maybe i'll be able to buy a gaming laptop soon "
1591,What model or brand of laptop were you considering?
1591,i'm probably gonna ask a friend to give me some recommendations since i'm pretty ignorant of the details
1591,"I have a Lenovo and an Acer. Both are great. As far as gaming goes, I prefer the Acer. "
1592,What kind of meat? I love steak in my burrito!
1592,Burritos are my favorite.
1592,What do you like as a side dish with your burrito?
1592,I love it with a naan
1592,What do you enjoy as a side dish with your burrito?
1592,i get a bean burrito
1592,Sounds delicious! I eat them whilst I go out fishing.
1592,fishing is quite fun. do you frequently do fishing?
1592,Yes all the time. Especially when the weather is nice. You should try it!
1592,where do you fish in mexico?
1592,I fish in a river near my house. What about you?
1592,"i do it on whitewater rivers mostly,not done sea fishing though"
1593,Wow there's more to football than I ever realized!
1593,It looks easy but can get very complicated.
1593,It's fascinated to learn about! 
1593,Do you play any sports?
1593,"No not really haha, unless going to festivals or partying counts!"
1593,I love sports.  I also play baseball in the off season.
1593,Baseball looks soo hard. I would be worried I'd get hit trying to catch a ball lol
1593,"That does happen!  As a linebacker, I take a lot of hits, but the baseball hurts worse."
1593,"I'll stay where it's safe, haha. What's your favorite band?"
1593,Lately I've been listening to 80s and 90s.  I'd have to say Nickelback.
1593,Nickelback! They're pretty good I like them too. I'm really diggin The Story at the moment.
1593,I like the videos that they do.  I like to play their music in the locker room.
1593,Does it help you to get pumped up for the game?
1594,I do a little of that.  I'm into the news.  I was even on the news once.
1594,That's cool! I do a blog with my opinion and book reviews etc. The Wall Street Journal picks it up sometimes.
1594,Wow.  That's a major publication.  My brush with news was a local channel and not for a crime. :)
1594,That's always a good thing lol. How have you been?
1594,Good. Thanks.  I'm planning a trip to CA.  Never been there.  How are you?
1594,"Oh, I'm great! I love California! Where are you planning on visiting while you're there?"
1594,"My buddy lives in Huntington Beach, so, LA. Not sure about details.  Would like to see the tar pits."
1594,"That would be nice. Just to relax on the beach, catch a few waves."
1594,Yep.  That sounds like a great way to prepare for winter.  What do you do for fun in NY?
1594,"Freeze lol. No, there's a ton to do. We do a lot of driving upstate to go to apple orchards, visiting small towns. "
1594,Cool. Sound like what people do in Boston.  Fall is cool there.
1594,I love Boston. The Celtics are my team. I went to college at Boston U. I abandoned the Knicks for the Celts
1594,"Yeah ditto on all of that, except I went to GA Tech.  ATL is OK.  Nice chat."
1594,"likewise , hopefully we will do this again . good night"
1595,I planned to go for vacation with my family
1595,That sounds really nice. Where are you travelling?
1595,Australia
1595,"I'm so jealous! I'll be working, probably. Which part of Australia are you visiting?"
1595,Sydney 
1595,"I hear it's really nice this time of year, I hope you have fun. Were you thinking of going to the gym before leaving?"
1596,"lol, if only food that tasted good was also good for you!"
1596,"I've given up trying substitutes! There's just no hope for me when it comes to eating and being happy, haha"
1596,too true! fresh pasta and crispy garlic bread loaded with melted butter... yum!
1596,"that sounds pretty good, I'll have to try that later!"
1596,"it's the best combo, you get to soak up all that extra sauce."
1596,I love most sauces. I think i am the world best sauce critic. Love tomato sauce/ketchup the best
1596,"me too, though a good pesto helps to mix it up every once and a while"
1596,"agreed ! sometimes a home cooked meal could not be beaten, especially with homemade sauce!"
1596,"too true, i'd be in a bad state if my wife ever chose to leave me..."
1596,I think we all feel you on that one!
1596,she looks at me weird sometimes when I have pink playing in the background
1596,"Why so, is she not a fan?"
1596,pink is usually not the go to for most guys
1596,"yea my girlfriend does as well , but i do not care what she thinks ."
1596,lol
1596,Haha! That is so cute!
1597,"Although it does irritate me, I feel deeply sorry for their troubles"
1597,Yeah modern society helps them out a lot in some places  but in others it's still lacking.
1597,"Yes, there is still a lot we should be doing for our fellow citizens."
1598,That's a cute name!  We like to take Ike to the beach when we surf.  We live in California.  Does your cat like to go outside?
1598,"My cat goes out rarely, because I am always busy working online"
1598,That's too bad.  What do you like to do for fun when you aren't working? Do you live near the beach?
1598,I love going out with friends to the park
1598,"That sounds great!  In California, we have a lot of great parks.  Where do you live?"
1598,I just moved to Florida. I used to work as box maker in LA and I lived there
1598,"Did you ever go surfing while you were in California?  And tell me about box making, that sounds interesting."
1598,Box making is actually quite boring. We just fold cartons. 
1598,Is that why you moved to Florida?  What do you do now?
1598,Nowadays I do online work. It is much more rewarding and interesting
1598,Nice!  I hope I can find the same kind of work in California.  More time to go surfing lol.
1598,You must really love surfing. Do you go the beach much?
1599,what things would you eat ?
1599,"meatballs,burgers,pizza...etc"
1599,not going to be very healthy 
1599,hmm we gain lot of weight should prefer fibre food
1599,i suppose you can burn off after
1599,i  wanna quit that profession
1599,what would you do instead?
1599,may be software engineer...what is your job...?
1599,i work in IT 
1599,testing or developer?
1599,developer mostly
1599,what should we do to get into that profession?
1600,My teacher does not have any hair. The sun shines off his head sometimes but its not too bad. 
1600,I hope my head doesn't shine too vigorously.
1600,You could always wear a hat if it did. My dad has lots of hats. His favourite one is his New York Yankees hat. 
1600,That's a great idea.
1600,Do you own any hats? You could go shopping. I hate shopping though. My mum and dad drag me to the mall sometimes.
1600,"Not at the minute, I should go buy some! Same here, it's so annoying. Don't you think?"
1600,Yeah its so boring. I would rather go play hockey but I'm not allowed out on my own. Do you play at sports?
1600,"Yeah, I play football at the weekends. When I'm not working as a chef. Do you like football?"
1600,I love football. I don't get to play much though as there are no teams by my house. What restaurant do you work at?
1600,I work at a local Italian restaurant. It's great fun!
1600,I love Italian food. My favourite dish is spaghetti bolognese. Do you serve that?
1600,"Yes, it's really popular! My personal favourite is Pizza."
1601,yes.. i work hard thats why i am leading a happy life
1601,hard work is important but some people work hard and never attain financial success or even stability 
1601,at starting stage in my career i do know how to tackle problems and now i am enough strong and enjoying my job
1601,if you enjoy your work that makes things much smoother
1601,yeah feels good
1601,"you know what else feels good? buying a sweater that fits properly, which i apparently failed to do yesterday"
1601,i enjoy shopping
1601,"me too, i swear this sweater fit when i tried it in the store but now i get home and it's huge "
1601,wear the sweater at trial room itself whether fit or not
1601,yeah i did that but maybe the lighting was weird or something because it definitely doesn't fit now
1601,return the item
1601,yep i'm gonna take it back to the store tomorrow and be really careful trying on the next one
1602,It was with the baltimore orioles. I've just been accepted on to their reserve roster
1602,"Wow that's amazing, you skipped the minor league system and earned a spot on the main roster... that is impressive"
1602,Thanks! I've been playing baseball for years so its great to be finally rewarded. What is it you do? 
1602,"Myself, I'm just a humble librarian who spends too much time reading to my cats."
1602,That's cool! I used to love going to the library at college. I went to Miami University. Did you go to college?
1602,"Yes, I went to Oxford University before being hired to oversee some of the operations if its library"
1602,"Oxford University? Wow you must be a clever clogs! I wish I was smart, but luckily I have my baseball career to fall back on. "
1602,"I used to be a professional athlete like you, but then I took an arrow to the knee"
1602,Oh no that sounds awful. Were you living in Skyrim at the time? I hear that's a dangerous place.
1602,"Long ago, near the beginning of time itself, but in this age it has become known as London, England"
1602,London? An even more dangerous place. I heard once a man pushed into the front of a queue and was never heard of again
1603,"lately not really, i'm currently a student at michigan state and i get feelings of imposter syndrome quite often"
1603,well you are socially conscious and many would say that's better.
1603,yeah it's good to have awareness of your limitations. i like watching Dancing with the Stars because it inspires me to try things outside of my comfort zone
1603,I'm not familiar with Dancing with the Stars but it seems like a good watch given that it has inspired to do more. What are your learnings?
1603,i'm studying economics and the math part makes me feel very insecure sometimes
1603,Well I'm done with studying and now I worry about everything else. I think it's my harsh inner critic.
1603,does it keep you from trying things that you would try if not for your inner critic?
1603,"Yes, I guess so. Although not always negative, it helps me maintain boundaries and see situations very clearly."
1603,"it's a fine line, i think a person who thinks they know than they do is more of a liability than a person who questions themselves"
1603,I think we are all our own best critics but we can be too hard on ourselves that sometimes it hinders us to do more.
1603,"it's true, plus being critical pushes us to be constantly improving "
1603,"Yeah, for sure, it always helps to give us a little boost. I'm not sure how to stop myself from being too critical though haha."
1604,my oartner do you like facebook
1604,"Yeah, i like facebook and how one gets to interact with other users. You do you like it?"
1604,yes and i use every time in the day i speak with my family
1604,great way to connect. Any other social media sites you use?
1604,yes i use very much instgram
1604,"I like Instagram too, a nice way store you picture memories"

1604,"Me too, I like twitter too"
1604,great this is very fair
1604,"yeah, looking at trending topics and knowing what happens in the world"
1604,"yes very true, do you like speking with the other people"
1604,"I do,one learns more and how people view different situations"

1606,yeah . i hate the dentist
1606,being a dentist is a nice career. 
1606,I don't think anyone enjoys going to the dentist.
1606,yes you are right lol
1606,"In China, dentistry was originally done by barbers."
1606,dentistry is a profession in my country different from barbers.
1606,Well they were originally called the 
1607,She's a writer and a really good one.I love to read her stuff and about anything else. :)
1607,"That's awesome, I also like reading. What sort of things does she write?"
1607,"When she's not misleading me, she writes Victorian novel in a modern setting."
1607,I like that idea! What do you mean by misleading you though?
1607,She kind of lied to me and didn't invite me out.  She was only home part of the time. What to you read?
1607,"That's awful, I'm sorry! Well I just started taking beauty classes so I've been reading a lot of fiction to de-stress from that."
1607,I get that.  I like to read in both English and French. French is a different view.  What fiction do you read?
1607,"Cool, I don't know any french. Mostly I read classics, I just finished Dracula."
1607,Cool.  Do you like Dickens?  
1607,"I do, I haven't had the chance to read many of them though. Do you like him?"
1607,"Yes, a good way to expand ones vocabulary.  Have you read any of Douglas Adam's stuff?"
1607,"I've read the hitchhikers guide series, it's one of my favourites! "
1608,my favorite place is the beach
1608,"I love the beach too.  The white sand and beautiful blue sea, in fact blue is my fav colour."
1608,yes is the most beautiful moment who like in my ife
1608,"I agree.  It takes all your worries away, especially if the sun is shining."
1608,yes do you like using the social media
1608,sometimes.  It helps to pass the time and helps me keep in touch with friends.  Which social media do you use?
1608,i like so much Instagram 
1608,"i actually dont use instagram, just facebook and snapchat.  Do you think instagram is better?"
1608,because i love to see the life of other people
1608,i understand that.  Well do you have any nice plans for today?
1608,reading any books and go to the mall
1608,sounds nice.  Unfortunately I have to do my cleaning.  I hate it so much! It is my least favourite household chore.
1609,is zoning a factor?
1609,Yes. I'd rather bake cakes than do more on Real Estate but we gotta hustle haha.
1609,the firm i work for has a number of lawyers that all seem miserable
1609,and how has the firm worked out for you?
1609,"they treat me well, I also got an issue with my roof dealt with rather quickly after buying my home once they lerned who i worked for :)"
1609,Good for you! Congrats also on your new home purchase. Hope you didn't get any real estate concerns to close that out :)
1609,"thanks! everything went well, except all the signing and initialing required, i was worried the pen would run out of ink!"
1609,"Hahaha, well it definitely seems worth it! What do you do for fun?"
1609,i like to read and travel. does your work have you traveling often?
1609,"Yes, been to a lot of places for tripping, travel is mostly for work though. I do tap dance and baking for fun."
1609,"tap dancing seems to be a lost art, i love watching old movies with tap dance numbers"
1609,"Yeah I agree, I love watching old movies with tap dance numbers as well. Though between broadway and jazz tap, I love broadway more."

1613,Really?what sort of cooking do you like to do?
1613,i like cooking the pies with nutella i love it

1613,do you like to eat healthy?
1614,When was the last time you performed yoga?
1614,It has been a while and I try to perform yoga once a week
1614,awesome! I think once a week is perfect for an activity like yoga. Do you have dogs?
1614,"I have no dogs, I am not a fan of pets. how about you?"
1614,I have two chiuahuahs that I practice yoga with. They are always getting in my way!
1614,"So sweet. I love to kayak when I am not working, I enjoy the activity so much. Do you like any sport?"
1614,"I have kayak'd before, flat water or rapids? I like to play tennis and golf. "
1614,"That is interesting, do you own one?"

1614,"Wow, do you have a stage name?"
1615,"sounds good, i see south korean stuff on netflix every once in a while, maybe we'll watch one during our next pizza night"
1615,Netflix is amazing!  Another show I love that just came back to Netflix in 2017 is Mystery Science Theater 3000.  Have you seen that?
1615,haven't seen the new one but i enjoyed the original. very funny lol 
1615,"yes , that is a good one ! do you like old comedies ?"
1615,"sometimes, a lot of the ones i used to like haven't aged very well though "
1615,I agree buy=t the younger generation sometimes does not appreciate the older classics.
1615,"it's important to understand the roots, none of the things they like today would exist without the classics"
1615,i agree and sometimes they're taken for granted .
1615,"sometimes it seems like there is too much media out there, can be overwhelming. a lot of the time i end up watching dog videos on youtube instead"
1615,Yeah it can be overwhealming.  I remember when cable first came to my house.  We thought it was great to have 30 channels to choose from.
1615,"haha yeah, much simpler times "
1615,Yes definitely simpler times. You went to the movie theater to catch a disney film and the arcade to play viceo game.
1616,well the negative can be that perfectionism makes you try to achive something unattainable.
1616,Perfectionism is annoying.  I like to work out but you’ll never get the perfect workout.  I don’t even try that.
1616,i want to move
1616,Where?  My parents live in Kentucky and that's pretty nice?
1616,i move to America
1616,Where are you know?  Where in America?
1616,every one knows that place
1616,I don't understand.  Where are you now?
1616,i am from United Kingdom
1616,I see.  Why to you want to leave the UK?
1616,my project is shifted
1616,"OK,  Work can do that.  What kind of work do you do?"
1617,yes.what about we will discuss?
1617,What are your hobbies?
1617,my hobbies are playing cricket and play music in piano..
1617,"I love the guitar, your favorite music?"
1617,nice to hear..usually i play keyboard in our church only
1617,"Wow,I think I should learn the piano. What do you do during your spare time?"
1617,"Hearing songs, watching and roaming in the facebook"
1617,"So you like social media, I love instagram"
1617,yes i like social media..but i dont want adict to any thing
1617,interesting... why so?
1617,Its  may lead to avoid the conversation with family members..
1617,"True, but you can always spare time for family. I prefer face to face conversations with family"
1618,Yeah i've been really upset lately thinking about my dad and how much I miss him
1618,"i'm sorry, not having loved ones in your day to day life is tough"
1618,Yeah it is. My job is really stressful at the moment to. Loads of clients are on my back
1618,"yuk, when it rains it pours eh? I went through a similar time when I went back to school"
1618,What happened at school? Sounds like you had a tough time.
1618,the studies in addition to work had me miss quite a few important life events
1618,"oh no, what did you miss? I missed the birth of my first child because I was working. It was horrible"
1618,"yeah, being stretched like that is no fun - birthdays, anniversaries, weddings I'll never be able to share memories with the ones I hold dear, "
1618,that's really sad to hear. Have you thought about a career change so you can spend more time with your loved ones?
1618,it was my career that led me to go back to school... but since getting my masters it opened me up to the position I have now :)
1618,That's maybe a bit more promising then. My job at the brewery is stressful but I love being surrounded by beer. Its important to follow a passion.
1618,indeed it is! do you have a favorite type of beer? I like pilsners!!
1619,Im sure it will turn up.  I am going to head to my local starbucks for my favourite coffee to try to relax a bit.
1619,That's a good idea.  Are there a lot of Starbucks where you live?
1619, I am lucky to have one just around the corner so it has become my local.  Do you have any?
1619,Oh yeah Texas is full of those things now.  I freakin love em!
1619,haha we definitely agree there!! Well what do you do to relax?
1619,"I like to camp and find peace.  I don't get to do it often, but finding quiet is important to me."
1619,"that sounds perfect. Just getting away from it all for a while. i love to swim, infact I was in my college team."
1619,"Do you find pools to swin in, or od you live near the ocean?"
1619,"both actually, I live about half an hour from the ocean but also have a great local pool i use in colder weather."
1619,"That's great.  We have a decent beach in my area, and I'd love to go swimming there, but Im afraid of the Rip currents"
1619,They are concerning.  Does your beach have life guards? My one has great ones that always advise us.
1619,"No not where I'm at.  There's some at a few of the larger beaches, but I hate large beaches.  Too many people."
1620,that is very interesting to know
1620,"yeah, it has become one of the most recognized sport around the world"
1620,I love to watch basketball on TV. 
1620,"Me too,did you watch the 2018 season finals"
1620,"Yes I did, Golden State Warriors were the winners."
1620,Do you have any other sport you watch?
1620,"Yes, I love to watch Football. My favorite team is the New York Jets"
1620,I love Miami Dolphins....I also love soccer
1620,Miami Dolphins are my biggest rival. Soccer is fun to watch too.
1620,Yeah.... I closely watch and follow the EPL nice teams and great talent
1620,there is alot of talent on the field.
1620,True..... what team do you watch most
1621,I trust god will protect me.
1621,God is good to people.  He is always there for you.
1621,Have you seen that show empire?
1621,No I have not but since it is on SyFy I bet I would like it.
1621,You should watch it! its my favorite show right now.
1622,"Nope.  Do you like TV?  I have a show that I like called Rick and Morty, it's hilarious."
1622,"i have not heard of that show, what is it about?"
1622,Just these two guys that get into all sorts of crazy situations.  The cab in Barcelona would almost be something that they would experience.
1622,"everyone needs a good comedy now and again, i sure miss seinfield!"
1622,Me too.  Loved that show.  I watch re-runs now and then. Do you like to read?
1622,"i'm more of a writer than a reader - though I did do a lot when I was younger, mysteries and whatnot"
1622,"Cool, I'm trying to write a novel now.  A fiction about a boy who helps protect the world from a alien invasion."
1622,"I always wanted to write a book, though short regular work with the local paper is where I wound up."
1623,indeed.  So what do you work as?
1623,I specialize in health and property with some investment on the side.
1623,"wow that sounds very impressive, i just work at my local sweet shop but I am studying to become a social worker."
1623,Wow that will surely be a rewarding career. I am impressed that you want to help others.
1623,I have always wanted to but I need to work to get through uni so my candy store helps pay the bills. 
1623,"I understand, you've got to do what you've got to do to keep the bills paid. :)"
1623,"that is true.  Your work sounds very stressful, what do you do to relax?"
1623,I usually unwind by listening to music or reading a good book.
1623,"I love to read aswell, every night I curl up with a good book.  I also find exercise relaxes me, every morning I do my two mile run."
1623,"That's really cool, I like to run as well but I don't normally run two miles unless the weather is good. Do you have any pets?"
1623,"yes I have a wee dog, a schnauzer called Milo who is 1.  What about you?"
1623,I have a Husky and a maltese Shiz Tzu. They are my little babies!
1624,That works.  I am currently working on my masters online for teaching.  
1624,Online classes takes some dedication versus going to class. Good for you!
1624,"Yeah I know.  I dis not want to pursue the career of working in a bank like my father,"
1624,sometimes you got to go with the career that you are happy the most.
1624,That is true.  I think he was disappointed though.  
1624,does not matter what your family thinks. you got to look at a career that makes you the most happy.
1624,That is true/  It my life not theirs.
1624,agreed.
1624,WHat are you studying??
1624,"Mine is education, what is yours?"
1624,I Have my B.S. In biology and education.  My masters will be in Biology.
1624,Oh that's cool. Where do you study?
1625,They are all different breeds.  They were rescued from shelters.
1625,"I actually adopted mine! I was surprised to find one in a shelter, and I got to save a tiny life!"
1625,I believe the dogs in shelters turn out to be the best animals.  Do you have any other pets?
1625,"No, just one. His name is Allie and he is truly my best friend.  "
1625,What are your hobbies?
1625,Love to cook and travel. How about you?
1625,That's basically my hobbies too.  I like to watch hockey and I like to watch my grandchildren play soccer.
1625,You have grandchildren? How many?
1625,3 grandsons and we will have another one in March.  Not sure yet if it is a boy or a girl.  They are our world!
1625,Oh my! That is a big family. I bet they are crazy for chocolate milk shakes.  I am.
1625,"Their parents don't allow them to have a lot of chocolate.  But when we go visit, we always take them sweets!!"
1625,I have the same rules for my kids.
1626,"Good, i was worried i was near my limit."
1626,That is cool that you like learning languages.  Do you travel?
1626,"Yes, i find it the best way to learn a language is to be surrounded by it."
1626,Agreed.  I have been to 7 different countries in Europe and 3 in Asia.  I love seeing new cultures.
1626,When my parents died i went to mexico to learn where they came from and i've been obsessed with traveling ever since.
1626,I'm sorry for your loss.  One thing I also enjoy is going to casino's on the weekends.  Just a little gambling.
1626,"Oh, you must have money. I make most my money translating, not to brag but i know close to 300 languages."
1626,"Not a lot, just a hobby to watch people.  Wow, that is a lot of languages.  I only know 4."
1627,that
1627,I know it sounds childish but Scooby doo is officially my favourite cartoon! Watching it relaxes me.  Do you watch any cartoons?
1627,"yeah of course i do watch lot of cartoons and i've a major in geology at alabama uni, do you like it"
1627,"Do you work in geology then? I work on the door at my local club, it a punk rock place.  It helps pay the bills while I finish studying."
1627,"no i'm not working anywhere now, I just got graduated from alabama, how about you"
1627,I am studying to become a nurse.  What would you like to do for a job?
1627,"study hard and always have patience, that will definitely help one day. where do you live"
1627,Im originally from canada but i am studying in pitsburgh.  i miss home but i do enjoy my course.
1627,"how old are you, i've a girl friend for the past 7 years, do have any"

1627,"yes of course, we're planning to do it on next year, would you like to come, and what is your name"
1627,"haha I dont know if your girlfriend would like you to invite people you have only just met, im sure you have plenty of family and friends to invite!"
1628,She is homeschooled.  
1628,no wonder i didnt know her
1628,What grade are you in?

1628,"Oh my, you're just getting started!! What is your favorite color?"
1628,I like black
1628,Black is my favorite color.  Halloween is coming up and I plan to wear a black witch's costume.
1628,thats awesome my sister wears black and shes in a band

1628,hey i talk to you later my mom just made me a ham and cheese sandwich
1628,Ok.
1629,It seems as if it is becoming more popular by the day. 
1629,it is. Alot of people like to go to clubs to listen to various kinds of music.
1629,The music is great but everything else club related is just not appealing to me. I have been listening so much thought it is interfering with my study time.
1629,Well luckily there are clubs that specialize in all kinds of music!
1629,I meant though not thought...The music really speaks to me but if I'm not careful it will be speaking on my way out of school. 
1629,the music is good to listen too. it makes you want to dance when you go to the clubs.
1629,I can dance to it wherever I am. 
1629,thats the fun part about listening and going to those type of clubs.
1629,You will have to go for both of us. I am staying away from them.
1629,why would you change the subject and say that your staying away from clubs. If you like the music?
1629,I didn't change the subject. I already said that I don't like the club scene but I love the music.

1630,We have a black lab that loves to run beside me when I go bike riding.
1630,Sandy (our dog) is not a very good guard dog because he is too friendly with everyone.  He is deathly scared of storms and lightening.
1630,That is a trait of most hunting breeds.  They are usually very friendly and good with kids.  
1630,We have 21 horses also so Sandy gets in the fields with them but never chases them.
1630,Thats great.  I live in a rural area so horses are out of the question you have to have 5 acres to keep one.
1630,"Fortunately, we have 31 acres and most everyone in our area has horses or other livestock."
1630,Yeah I would love to be able to keep other aniamls but only have 3 acres which is a lot in my area.
1630,"I love the acreage, but it is a little difficult to keep up considering I have a full time job elsewhere."
1630,Yeah I can understand that.

1634,I'm looking forward to hunting. My favorite season is duck hunting season.
1634,"Oh, nice. I never really got into hunting. I tried it as a bit as a kid, but it's not my thing."

1634,"I'm from New England, so it's gotta be the Patriots."
1634,Good choice!  Mine is the Redskins even though they aren't exactly the greatest.
1634,"Nothing wrong with that. They don't have any play-related controversy surrounding them, which is good."
1634,That's true. So what else do you like to do for fun? Got any plans for the upcoming holidays?
1634,"Travel to Florida around Christmas, probably, to visit my brother and dad and other assorted family. Yourself?"
1634,"It'll be a warm Christmas for you. Haha. That's cool, I'll be visiting my family in Virginia around Thanksgiving."
1634,Very nice. I've never been to Virginia.
1634,"Oh wow, you should visit Virginia sometime then. Washington D.C. has a lot of monuments, museums, and tourist attractions to explore and check out."
1635,No! An actual stick.  It was supposed to be a joke! I really didn't find it funny.
1635,uh? that joke does not make any sense at all.
1635,"They took me out for fast food later, so that made up for it.  I really like fast food."
1635,oh ! it would have been better to be a simple joke for others to understand .
1635,"It was supposed to be a hockey stick, but they have a weird sense of humor. "

1655,Adorable. How old are they?
1655,My dog is 4 and my cat is 8
1655,My dog is named Whisky. haha. Is that a surprise?
1656,"I'm gonna have to go with Knock Me Down, but it's sooooooo hard to pick just one. they are my life"
1656,Californication is probably the one that comes to mind for me as well.
1656,any other bands you've been listening to recently?
1656,I love the song that is California Love!
1656,been listening to a lot of Beatles lately. the weird thing is my bulldog prefers them over the Chili Peppers
1656,Oh I like them too. I like that song I think it is called 
1656,Strawberry Fields surely
1656,Yes. That song was released in 1997 by the way
1656,....I really don't think so. pretty sure that was in 67 haha
1656,Teenage Dream was her Third album
1656,oh was Katy Perry a member of the Beatles at one point? I would've thought she'd be a groupie
1656,Teenage Dream is my favorite Katie Perry album
1657,I prefer cookies to birthday cakes!
1657,I can relate. What is your favorite type of cookie?
1657,I love white chocolate chip cookies! The ones that are soft in the middle.
1657,"I will have to try that!  I love cookies that have chocolate chips in them, too."
1657,So what do you do as a job?
1657,"I work as an analyst, headquartered in Bentonville."
1657,"Woah, that's a good job!"
1657,Thanks. So what do you do for work?
1657,I am a Computer Science student and I work in a bar.
1657,"Very cool, I'm currently majoring in computer software engineering. :)"
1657,I am going down more of the artificial intelligence and agent based systems route.
1657,Sounds pretty interesting. I hope everything goes well for you.
1657,You also!
1658,I think patriotism is not always easily definned. It is individual to us personally
1658,Yeah that's true. I think just general support for society and the community is good.
1658,"It is-- Like, community values. Loving my dog and my wife and family is just as patriotic as the next thing."
1658,Exactly! And it's so easy to love dogs no matter what.
1658,Right!  LOL
1658,What kind of dog do you have?
1658,He is a blue nosed pitbull named Benjamin 
1658,That's a great breed. I'm currently trying to convince my girlfriend to get a dog instead of a cat.
1658,"There is a time and a place for everything. I am way past my ""cat"" time. Plus, dogs are way cooler! "
1658,"I agree, I love dogs. Cats can be good, it's either hit or miss with them though LOL."
1658,"I am just not a fan of their nails, mostly.  But I do love them a lot"
1658,"I'm allergic to them too, maybe we will get a hairless one!"
1658,Good luck with it all! Have a great day. Gotta go to work 
1658,"Thank you, have a good one!"
1659,I would love to try and learn more about These places so i could do some tours for people 
1659,Definitely!  My grandmother is from Denmark. She can give you a tour!
1659,That sounds great. Denmark seems such a nice place. it would make a change of giving tours of the same old places. 
1659,We should definitely go!  They have a restaurant with great meat loaf there too.
1659,Ive only tried meatloaf from the store i work in. Is meatloaf big in Denmark?
1659,"It is! It's actually a traditional German, Scandinavian, and Belgian dish!"
1659,I love to learn new facts like this. Do you spend much time there?
1659,Not as much as I would like to.
1659,You should definitely go and stay with your Grandmother more. And see The place more 
1659,I am definitely planning too! I try to visit her once a year. It's just very expensive to fly!
1659,Do you stay for a long period of time? Where is the best place to stay in Denmark?
1659,I try to stay for about a month. 
1660,"That's great, I like to run long distances."
1660,Yeah I do mostly endurance running.  It is mostly flat where I live in Cape Hatteras NC.
1660,"I've only recently started endurance running, though I need to improve my diet for more energy."
1660,that is wise . i try to stay active but i have had to work on stamina.
1660,That makes sense.  Do you have any advice for someone just starting out?
1660,Start slowly and stick with it.  Do just a few more steps each day.
1660,"Excellent, thank you.  My first goal is to eventually run a half-marathon, then go from there."
1660,Sounds like a goal to me. Good luck!
1660,"Thank you, I like to set stretch goals for myself.  Here's hoping I'm able to stick with it!"
1660,The important to reach a goal it to have a plan and commit to it.
1660,"Absolutely, do you have any longer term or stretch goals you're working towards?"
1660,Yeah I am trying to loose 50 lbs
1661,oh yeah they didn't damage it at all. I just told them to leave it by my door
1661,Glad to hear! What kind of car do you have if you don't mind me asking?
1661,no car actually! I just take the bus to work and my classes. even to pick up my kid from daycare
1661,okay! why did you make that choice?
1661,cars are expensive and my child and school already cost enough!
1661,"If we had a better public transportation system where I live, I'd probably choose that over cars."
1661,yeah it's actually pretty convenient. but hopefully when I'm a doctor someday I'll be able to afford my own car
1662,"I am glad I get to stay at home, but sometimes I miss working."
1662,what do you miss about it?
1662,The interaction with other adults and just getting time away from the home.
1662,"I understand about adult company, but I'm kind of a homebody myself"
1662,"I love that I get this time with my kids.  Everyone says, You'll miss this time! and I agree."
1662,"You will, can't believe my adult girls were once tiny babies and toddlers. Loved those times"
1662,I do get to help my husband with his business.  He owns an auto repair shop and I help him with the paperwork.  
1662,"Very important! Hope business is good, life is very expensive these days"
1662,He does pretty good.  I live in Michigan and the economy here hasn't been great.
1662,"I have 2 jobs to make ends meet, teach during the week, tend bar on the weekends"
1662,It seems like a lot of people are having to take on two jobs just to make it these days.
1662,"yep kind of sad, AND I live in a tiny house to cut down on expenses"
1663,Yeah I watch the tv show whenever I have a chance
1663,I love Pokemon.
1663,That's great do you play the computer game or the card game?
1663,I play Pokemon GO on my mobile device. It's very fun especially when you have a crowd of friends to play with you too. You?
1663,I've never played but it does look interesting. I look to cook so it takes up a lot of my time.
1663,Do you enjoy cooking for others or for the event you are taking it to?
1663,Yes for sure! I like trying new dishes and having my friends and family be my test tasters.
1663,"Where do you have your meals? The standard is usually at home or restaurants but really, one can have meals anywhere!"
1663,"At home mostly, I'm tryingto save for house so I don't really eat out much. How about you, do you eat out a lot?"
1663,Yes I do. I love the combination of breakfast and lunch. How about you?
1663,"I rarley eat lunch since my mornings are normally very busy for me. But I love food in general, I could ate all day if I couldn't gain weight."
1663,Food is the gateway to life.
1664,i have a dog named percy i love him very miuc.
1664,Wow. What a change of subject. Does your dog fart when he eats as well?
1664,wow yes it was i thought i had to talk first sorry.

1664,yes he do. lol
1664,"Thats great. I play music for my dog, I'm practicing to be in a band someday...."
1664,how cute to see that wow. i love my dog percy.
1664,Thats a great name for a dog.
1664,yes it is what your dog name?
1664,Knox. Like Fort Knox.
1664,wow how cute why that name?
1664,My dog is a Rottweiler. Strong and tough.
1665,"Yes me too, Italian food is heavenly"
1665,Yes i do love Italian as well. Past is my favorite dish. What is your favorite?
1665,"Good old spaghetti, can't be beat!"
1665,Do you like to cook?
1665,"I do if I have time, but I am very busy these days"
1665,"I hear you! Life is SO busy, never enough hours in the day!"
1665,"so true, I am almost always on the road in my car "
1665,"Do you travel a lot for work? At the moment I'm on a break, so I have some more time for my  strange hobbies. "
1665,Yes in sales. Had to get a new Chevy the other week because the old car died. What hobbies do you have?
1665,"I'm working on restoration of a vintage furniture, helps me relax. Put some old Beetles album go with a flow. You? "
1665,That sounds really cool. Me I like writing music
1665,Wow! That's so cool!! What kind of music do you write?
1666,"That's interesting! I am a cyclist myself, so maybe I need some tips on how to stay fit from a fellow athlete!"
1666,"the gym is a great place to start , make new friends and get fit"
1666,Great tips thanks. So do they play for the Buffalo Bills or is that a rival team in the league?
1666,"They are the hometown team, been a big fan since I was 8"
1666, Nice to have stuck with a team that long! I've been a Cowboys fan from birth myself. I've been close to switching teams. Ha!
1666,Ha! My whole family are Bills fans. The Cowboys look decent after the last game.
1666,"Yes, this year I'm hoping for great things from my team. Do you have a favorite player?"
1667,"are is nice. music especially. if you can listen to good quality, anyway :\"
1667,I listen to the same things I listened to in high school and that was 15 years agi
1667,Do you use airpods or something like that? I'm trying to decide what my next pair of headphones should be. My current ones just broke.
1667,I do use headphones quite frequently actually.  I personally use Bose.  What is your favorite food?  Mine is pizza.a
1667,"Hehe, pizza is definitely up there. But for my money, yeah definitely a good lasagna. Like good old garfieldy boy."
1668,"I like shrimp, but cannot eat them unfortunately.  My fingers are long and I have a hard time peeling them."
1668,"I love shrimp, especially fried shrimp. Have you been on a shrimp boat?"
1668,I actually never have been.  I've seen them on Forest Gump though.
1668,"Oh yes, that movie is great! My favorite movie is Mt. Everest, what about you?"
1668,I am not familiar with that movie.  What is it about?  My favorite movie is Good Fellas.
1668,"It's a movie about climbing Mount Everest, which I would love to do some time! That movie is a classic as well, do you have any hobbies?"
1668,"I like to oil paint, but don't have much time for it.  I'm usually driving my kids around to their activities.  How about you?"
1668,"I understand that completely with the kids and I am a terrible artist. I usually just spend some extra time in the garden, do you have one? "
1668,"I do.  We grow tomatoes mostly, but mix in some herbs as well.  My long fingers do not impede me with gardening."
1668,"That is fantastic, we also grow tomatoes, among many other things! Why are your fingers long?"
1668,Not sure.  I guess I was just born this way.
1668,"That is quite interesting but unique as well, that is great you have no issues with them. Is it raining at your place now?"
1669,"I've always thought of adopting. Kind of skips the ""hard"" years of parenting!"
1669,I plan to give it a few more years untill i am in my mid 20's. thats true. have you looked into it much?
1669,"Not too much, just a thought that I have. My best friend down the street has adopted and they're wonderful."
1669,"Wow, thats awesome. did they have any issues? im a bit worried with a few issues that might come with it. "
1669,"No, not really. What issues are you concerned with?"
1669,One major thing is whether I'm going to be a good enough parent and have good parenting skills.  I'm also worried about affording it all.
1669,"Well, those are things you'd face with having your own children too! Just make sure you're prepared."
1669,Thats what everyone says. I just want the best for them. And some children deserve that chance!
1669,"Of course, that's one reason to adopt. To help those kids have that chance."
1669,Absolutely!  Its nice to know others have the same perspective. I plan to prepare for a few more years untill i am 100% ready
1669,"Good luck with that, but for now definitely concentrate on school/career!"
1669,"Yeah, i think trying to keep up with school and work is hard enough atm. Thanks for the great advice"
1670,It really is! I plan to surprise my sister with some new plants for her garden with the money!
1670,oh yeah? what sorts of things does she grow?
1670,She grows roses and any type of flowers that you can think of!
1670,"you know, when I was visiting Germany they had some absolutely amazing cornflowers there. you should consider giving her one!"
1670,"Oh, that is a great idea!  I have never heard of cornflowers!"
1670,well look em up! they're actually the color I dye my hair :)
1670,Oh that's cool!  What color is your hair?
1670,the color of sunflowers :)
1670,That's so beautiful!
1670,thank you! i did not mean to show off. haha
1670,That is fine!  I'll have to go visit them sometimes and see them in person.
1670,have any hobbies of your own? besides gifting wonderful flowers!
1671,Chocolate is my favorite flavor too but yes to gelato. I eat way too much of it when I am sad.
1671,"Emotional eating is real, I sometimes do it too!"
1671,Since my best friend moved to Japan it seems like I do this more often than not. I need to get over it.
1671,"A rainbow of flavor possibilities, you must miss your friend."
1672,Is that northern or southern california?
1672,"yes , southern california right on the median border"
1672,I have ridden my motorcycle through california a lot.  Lots of great bands in SoCal
1672,That's true! Any particular bands you're a fan of?
1672,More into Radiohead and the like . I also like 80's punk and new wave  
1672,Punk from any era is great! Haven't listened to Radiohead but I've heard plenty of good things about them.
1672,"Yeah they've changed a lot over the years, but they're super involved in thins I care about.  Politically and socially"
1672,"Political music is great when done right, I'm a fan of it."
1672,Nice! 
1672,"I listen to a good amount of political rap, and there's a lot to say in that genre."
1672,"Absolutely.  I'm from Detroit and have listened to a fair amount of rap thorugh the years.  That genre has changed quite a bit, as well."
1672,"The change has been good and bad, haha. Lot of trash out there, but there's still a lot of good tracks out there."
1673,"Cool, you must be old like me...haha"
1673,i grew up in the nineties but listen to the seventies and eighties
1673,How did you get into these type of music?
1673,I prefer to listen to all time good songs oldest as well as latest album if they are good
1673,You must have good taste in music. I listen to investing podcasts.
1673,Other than music what else you like to do  to relax
1673,I like to watch tv and surf the net while drinking a glass of wine.  You?
1673,I do surf in net but without wine and cooking  trying different dishes
1673,"Nice, what is your favorite dish?"
1673,"I cant say specifically one dish, dishes which made with chicken and those taste good"
1673,Do you make healthy dishes?
1673,Always wanted to make but sometimes i cook and  have junk foods too for the taste
1674,I bet that is a fun time. I miss spending time with my family at times. We haven't spoken in years.
1674,why don't you speak with them anymore?
1674,After my parents passed we all just kind of drifted away and our doing our own things.
1674,Sorry to hear that. how long ago did they pass?
1674,My father passed away 10 years ago and my mother was around 5 years ago. 
1674,what was your favorite family vacation growing up?
1674,My favorite would have to have been going camping. Every summer we would got to different state parks and camp for a week. I loved it.
1674,That sounds like a fun trip. I love camping.
1674," It was fun, I haven't been camping since. I always see post from my 4,000 friends on Facebook camping and I think I should go. "
1674,You should do it.
1674,I may now that the weather is getting cooler.
1674,i bet my dogs would love the cooler weather .
1675,They gave me a half pound of chicken instead of turkey. I didn't realize till I got home.
1675,oops i wished i had a piece of chicken would be nice .
1675,Yeah i thought about taking it back but it was rotisserie chicken so it was really good. Turkey next time. 
1675,i really love rotisserie chicken. it's so delicious when it's roasted in an oven
1675,It sure it. What other foods do you like?
1675,Everything to me lol!  Sweet and sour chicken is the BEST i also love kfc
1675,sweet and sour chicken is delicious. i just had Chinese food yesterday. 
1675,i have been eating sweet and sour chicken since then . love it !
1675,my favorite thing to get when i order chinese is crab rangoons. so good.
1675,"i see, what is your name? and what would u like to be?"
1675,oh. my name is todd. i used to be a computer programmer but am since retired.
1675,"todd, what a great name! i want to be a music teacher"
1676,I like when people put aquatic plants in the aquarium with the creatures.
1676,I had a tank with both fish and plants. It is probably my most viewed aquarium. It is a lot of work though.
1676,"I have lots of houseplants, but none in an aquarium. i can imagine its a lot of work."
1676,The algae creates such a mess. It's a hobby that involves lots of cleaning. URGH! What are your hobbies?
1676,"Supporting my children, horseback riding as well."
1676,Oh fun. I've only gone horseback riding one time. Do your children enjoy it?
1676,Yes. It's been wonderful watching them get comfortable around and on horses from a young age.
1676,That must be tons of fun. I don't have children...I guess the fish are my babies. LOL. How many children do you have?
1676,"Two boys. Can be a hand full sometimes, actually often. LOL"
1676,LOL. My sister has boys - my brother has girls. Boys are a lot more everything but you gotta love em! 
1676,"Raising children is always a challenging. Rewarding though, at least thats what I tell myself."
1676,I have trouble keeping up with myself. I can't imagine managing children too.
1677,Maybe he just went into massive debt for it.
1677,"eh, I'm smelling something a little more fishy than that. what do you think he's up to?"
1677,"Well, he does seem to have some late night trips at 3AM lol."
1677,"oh boy. the only thing that's awake around here at 3AM is my cat! haha, suspicious...."
1677,Maybe I'll do what he's doing! I only make 30k a year and could use a new car.
1677,yeah I honestly don't need much to live a good life. going to folk music festivals isn't that expensive
1677,Folk music festivals? Sounds fun! I've only been to a few metal concerts.
1677,oh boy I think those would be too loud for me. I'm rather shy. did you have a good time?
1677,"I'm shy too! Yes I did, it's very loud but the music and shows are always great."
1677,I did use to listen to a little Marilyn Manson in my youth....
1677,Marilyn Manson is really catchy! His interviews are pretty funny and witty too.
1677,yeah he's always seemed like a really thoughtful guy
1678,I fear some kind of horrible accident. I paint houses for a living so I am always high up on ladders. 
1678,That is scary maybe you should find a different way to make a living? Is that possible
1678,"Possibly. I mean I like my job and it's a good living, I just constantly have this nagging fear. Maybe just paranoia. "
1678,"Maybe, but that could also be a warning to you, I dont know I am only 15 so I dont have a job yet"
1678,What kind of job do you want to get when you do get a job. A part time job can be a lot of fun!
1678,"Well I live in the US in Florida so ultimately I want to work at Disneyworld, but really who doesnt?"
1678,"Oh wow, that sounds like a lot of fun. What character would you want to be if you could wear any costume? "
1678,"Gosh I dont know any of them would be great, possibly a more interesting character like Stitch"
1678,Stitch would be a fun one. I would want to be one of the old ones like Donald Duck. Those costumes would be hot though!
1678,"With the heat and humidity, I can not imagine being in a costume all day"
1678,Maybe they have little air conditioner units inside. I know some college mascot costumes do. 
1678,oh I wonder if they do too that would be great
1679,"I love reading, I recently finished The Goldfinch."
1679,How was Goldfinch? I've seen it at the store. 
1679,It was long but so well written.
1679,I may use my discount card and get it. Reading makes my bus commute so much better.
1679,"Since you enjoy Art, the Goldfinch theme of art may really be your thing!"
1679,You are the second person to say that. Makes me really want it.
1679,"I learned a lot by reading it, the author works in info about Rembrandt and many others."
1679,I tell my nieces and nephews - - the more you read the more you know. Reading is relaxing and educational.
1679,I so agree!  I recently joined a book club which encourages me to read outside my normal zone.
1679,I wish I had time for a bookclub. Sometimes at work I will sneak off and get some reading in.
1679,"Ditto, I also read when I feel overwhelmed, it helps me relax."
1679,Do you ever feel like you need more hours in the day just to read? I sure do.
1679,I do wish I had more time to indulge/read.
1679,Do you ever read more than one book at a time? I tried it and didn't enjoy either book as much I thought.
1679,"I do that all the time.  Yes, it does spread diminish the experience a little for each."
1680,"Wow, you do know your stats!"
1680,Yeah. I'm a big sports fan. Love football and basketball.
1680,"I didn't really like sports growing up, but in my early adulthood I really got into Football. It was very social!"
1680,Very social. We love having people over for sport events - gives me a chance to make my famous brownies.
1680,"LOL_ I was just there for the food at first, then I learned to love the game. Got fat too!"
1680,haha...That is the truth. I work out like crazy all summer long just to pick the weight back up in the winter. Crazy cycle.
1680,"Right! Well, my husband and I just bought a camper and we're headed south, so I have no excuse not to exercise!"
1680,I'm learning everything in moderation. 
1680,"That's true, but I have cut out a lot of bread and sweets!"
1680,"I wish I could cut the sweets, I wouldn't have to work out so hard. My brownie recipe calls for so much sugar. "
1680,"It's tough, but we are also going to live in the camper over the winter and there is really no storage, so I don't have junk food around me."
1680,What part of south are you going? Living in a camper is different. I like that idea.
1681,yikes! which species specifically are you talking about?
1681,A lot of snakes have that. They can be pretty scary!
1681,yeah I honestly have no idea how I stomach owning 2 myself...my friend passed them off on me!
1681,"You own 2 of them!? Jeesh, do you have to feed them mice?"
1681,"no no, I spring for the best organic snake food money can buy. the same stuff I eat basically"
1681,Those snakes sound spoiled. They're probably eating healthier than the junk I eat.
1681,oh well there's always time to change! what's your favorite junk food?
1681,Definitely noodles. Usually cheap ramen. I love it for some reason.
1681,"oh well I'll be honest, sometimes when I'm at my asian market buying healthy stuff I'll grab a packet of the deluxe ramen...."
1681,I usually find that the really cheap ones taste the best. My taste buds must be broken.
1681,my try to make your own ramen someday! there are some really good recipes online
1681,Sounds good! And then you can feed it to your pet snakes lol.
1682,Is dancing is your profession for passion
1682,"Yes, I love dancing and performing for others. I also like teaching dance in my free time."
1682,Is dancing is your profession
1682,"Not my main one, but it's a good side gig."
1682,oh...what is your dance style...
1682,"We mostly do ecstatic dance, as I've talked about before."
1682,"Sorry  I forgot,other than dancing what else you like to do the most"
1682,I like to work out at the gym quite often.
1682,So everything is towards  fitness
1682,"Yes, that's what keeps me in tip top shape."
1682,Hmm..how much time you spend everyday for these.
1682,A couple hours here and there!
1683,yes they are grown up. i make 50k a year most of the expenses are for them
1683,Are you OK with that? I'm sure once they become full adults and earn their on money things will get easier!
1683,"yeh im ok with that, i spend most of my time making clothes. i like to make clothes specially for them"
1683,Wow that's so cool. Have you been doing that for a long time?
1683,yeh its been like almost 8 years now
1683,Do you have your on page where you sell those stuff?
1683,right now i don't have any pages but i will make one so i can get more customers
1683,"That would be great, some people can earn a lot of money on that."
1683,yap! its a pleasure to meet you
1683,You too! Thanks!
1683,have a wonderful time.
1683,You too!
1684,I think it would be pretty cool to be your own boss. That way you could manage your own schedule.
1684,"Yes, I feel like my boss thinks he owns me and can just rent me out whenever he feels like it."
1684,"Yeah, same. And you could schedule your time off whenever you like. I like to travel so that would be a huge bonus."
1684,What kind of destinations do you like to travel to?
1684,I live in the northern part of NY (near Syracuse) so I like going into Canada for weekend hiking trips. It's really pretty up there.
1684,I wish I lived in Canada. I bet the weather is great compared to where I live.
1684,"Oh yeah, where is that? "
1684, I live in Alabama and it's hot about half the time. NY is a great state. You're lucky.
1684,I've not really spent much time in the South. I like to run so not sure how well I'd do in the heat.
1684,"Lots of people do it, but they are stronger than me. Do you like Syracuse?"
1684,Very much. Though we can get a lot of snow in the winter which can be just as bad as too much heat I'd suspect.
1684,"I used to love snow, I guess because I saw it so rarely. These days, not so much."
1685,"I agree, but I work two jobs so it's hard to find free time sometimes."
1685,"I completely understand that.  I've always wanted to go skydiving, but I'm too afraid I might go splat."
1685,I would never do that. I'm afraid of heights.  I would just stay on the ground and look at the sky.
1685,"Oh, me too! I would love the feeling of being weightless though.  "
1685,"That might be pretty cool to experience.  You can try and I'll watch.  My favorite color is blue, so maybe you wear a blue diving suit."
1685,"Blue is a lovely color.  Green is my favorite, like those cacti in the desert.  That's where I want to live. "
1685,Maybe Arizona or New Mexico would be a good choice.  Lots of dessert and hot weather there.
1685,"How about Black Rock Desert? It's north of Reno, Nevada. It's super cool - made up of lava flats and playa."
1685,That sounds really neat.  I visited Red Rock Canyon once and thought that was beautiful.
1685,The Grand Canyon would be amazing too!  The coolest place I've ever visited was the Outer Banks of North Carolina. I love the ocean.
1685,"Our family went there with some friends last summer.  We stayed in Corolla, and loved it!"
1685,Did you get to visit Kitty Hawk?  The first flight took place there.  Historical sites are so interesting.
1686,Oh I see. Did you play any sports in high school?
1686,"No, I didn't play sports, however, i was in several extracurricular activities in High School"
1686,What types of extracurriculars? I did cheerleading and had a great time with it.
1686,"I was in Beta Club, FFA, FCCLA, Students for Christ, National socieities"
1686,"That sounds like a fun bunch of activities. I also enjoy shopping, do you?"
1686,I do enjoy shopping. Most of my shopping is for my 5  years old niece who I am raising. 
1686,I really like going to the mall. What is your niece into?
1686,"she just started kindergarten, so she loves learning, and gets upset when she doesn't have homework. She is a cheerleader, & had her 1st field trip yesterday"
1686,That sounds exciting! Kids are so fun.
1686,"they are. I love kids. I love working with kids, I majored in psychology with a emphasis on Child and family "
1686,it was nice chatting with you. have a great day!
1686,You as well. Have a great day.
1687,She might have troubled a lot and it's quite sad.
1687,I heard she was a bit of a recluse and didn't really interact socially. So it could have been difficult holding down a profession.
1687,"Yes, sometimes it looks everything's fine, but you don't realize what all pain one's going through."
1687,It just goes to show how fragile life is. Makes you appreciate what you have. It did create an amazing talent within her though.
1688,It can be but i have my cats to keep me company
1688,"Cats are very fun, sometimes"
1689, my favorite purse is a deep shade of red 
1689,Really that is an interesting choice! I feel like it would make a pretty color for table cloth linens.
1689,"I have never thought about that, it would be really pretty!"
1689,It might also be a good color for drapes. What do you think?
1689,I think it would be great for that or accent pillows!
1689,"I always wanted to study interior design, but I decided on Geology instead"
1689,Geology? that sounds interesting what does it entail?
1689,It's basically the study and collecting of rocks and mineral specimens for fun.
1689,"o ok neat, have you found anything rare or valuable?"
1689,mostly remains of past civilizations .
1689,wow! thats amazing. 
1689,History is one my favorites as well!
1690,"What does your husband do exactly, seems like you have a lot of money?"
1690,He works hard so I can stay home with our child.
1690,Do you have a horse?
1690,More like the horse has us
1690,"hahahaha, how long does it take?"
1690,Horses are from free to expensive to get.  not so cheap to have
1690,What breed do you have?
1690,One of the wild horse adoption animals kinda of a mustang
1690,i find them so cool and powerful. I want one for myself
1690,their is a reason they are free!  getting it saddlebroken was expensive
1690,How much is saddle?
1690,Depends on the saddle and what you want it for
1691,"I'm just chatting here, but I'm keeping my eye on that ugly spider in the corner."
1691,whoa how big is it
1691,It's pretty big.  To me it looks as big as that airplane I fly on the weekends. 
1691,that's an odd comparison to make. although I'm very familiar with giant spiders since they're in the comic book I'm currently drawing
1691,I don't know how you do that.  I am so scared of those things.
1691,well it's just ink on the page. nothing as scary as the real punks who try to cause trouble a the club I bounce in the evenings
1691,"I bet you have lots of scary, ugly spiders in that club too!"
1691,"oh yeah, very strange, heavy set, drunk 2 legged spiders"
1691,That's so funny! Thanks for giving me a laugh.  I just hope I never see a spider when I'm flying my plane.
1691,when did you learn to fly? how long did it take?
1691,"About 15 years ago, and it took me about 5 years to become certified to fly anything."
1691,do you use it to get around or just for fun?
1692,"Well, parenting is a learning curve. Some parents improve with time. "
1692,Parents are not always right!
1692,"No they are not! I'm the baby of the family, youngest of four, and I was spoiled. "
1692,"I was the youngest, too!  Everyone said I was spoiled."
1692,"I became a school psychologist, maybe so I could figure out some of these things! What do you do?"
1692,"I have essentially retired, I used to work in University Advancement."
1692,Oh that sounds interesting. I mostly work with children and sometimes their parents. 
1692,What grade level are the children?
1692,"They are grades 1 through 6, so quite little. "
1692,I imagine you deal with the parents quite regularly.
1692,"Yes, I often do. The children are the easiest part of the job!"
1692,"Parents, both helicopter and snow plow types can be difficult!"
1693,I loved To Kill a Mockingbird. It inspired a lot of the art I made a few years ago.
1693,Really? What kind of art was it?
1693,I have paintings and I've made a few ceramic figurines.
1693,Oh that's cool. Another book I really love is The Picture of Dorian Gray.
1693,I haven't read that. I need some new inspirations-I'll check it out. 
1693,"It's great, Oscar Wilde is a great author if you ever have the time to read his stuff."
1693,"Sadly, or maybe not, reading and creating art make me ravenous for sushi and pizza. The bloat after:("
1693,I absolutely love pizza and sushi. The bloat is worth it!
1693,Those are my absolute favorites. I could eat one or the other every day!
1693,There's a sushi and a pizza place at the bottom of my apartment complex! Lucky me.
1693,Yes. Lucky you. I love in the suburbs and have to drive 40 minutes to get either. Good thing Grub Hub exists huh?
1693,"Grub hub is great, I usually use all the food delivery services because they all have sign up bonuses and free deliveries."
1694,I am from Kentucky 
1694,How long you have been living there?
1694,"My whole life, 32 years. Where are you from/ "
1694,"I am from Adelaide, love this place a lot."
1694,"Where is Adelaide, never heard of it? "
1694,Oh! It's in Australia. One of the state capitals.
1694,Oh that is awesome. i would love to go to Australia. My sister wants to become a missionary there. 
1694,That's great! I am sure that she'll enjoy her stay.
1695,I didn't use a lawyer for my last divorce and kind of got taken to the cleaners. That was a big lesson.
1695,"Yes, it can get very sticky quickly. Those divorce papers are like books and it's better if a lawyer reads it to you!"
1695,You are right. I am learning that my last name makes it easy for me to get married but hard to get divorced.
1695,"Haha, very true indeed. How many divorces have you been through already?"
1695,I've been through 3 divorces - this will be my fourth. You'd think I would have learned by now.
1695,"Oh wow, yes and sorry for the bad luck! Keep pushing the right person is there. Maybe on the beach waiting?"
1695,That's my problem. Beach bunnies:) The right one will come...I guess.
1695,"Ha, yes indeed the good ole beach bunnies. I love going to the beach and enjoying the ocean, where is your favorite?"
1695,I love Jamaica and Hawaii. Locally I love Nantucket and the Outer Banks.
1695,"No kidding on the Jamaica and Hawaii, a dream place! The local beaches sound nice, I go to Panama City."
1695,I've been to Panama City once. Great area. Maybe I'll try the slopes for wife #5.
1695,"Lol, great idea on changing up the style! Some snowboarders usually love taking risks and are adventurous."
1696,Me too. I keep trying to get him to volunteer with me - I think it would help him be more empathetic.
1696,That sounds like a good plan. Where do you volunteer?
1696,I volunteer at the Red Cross on the weekends. It makes me feel really good and helpful.
1696,That's really cool of you. I spend most of my weekends rollerblading at the park. I try to be very active.
1696,Oh that's wonderful! Do you enjoy it?
1696,Very much. Several of my friends and I meet up to do it. Do you have any active hobbies.
1696,I do yoga pretty frequently. It's made my back stop hurting almost entirely!
1696,"I love yoga, but I'm not great at it. Very inflexible. I've been trying to do the healthy thing, you know eating right, exercise..."
1696,"It's great once you get started, but it takes a while to touch your nose to your knees. What's your favorite food?"
1696,That's a tough one. I love food! Probably have to say any kind of breakfast foods. Especially anything with eggs and avocado. You?
1696,"I second the eggs. I've got a flock of chickens, so the eggs are always fresh! I can't live without potatoes though."
1696,That is so cool that you have chickens! Though my cat would probably terrorize them. She's a beast. Do you have other animals?
1697,They seem to be doing  OK. I keep busy volunteering at the Red Cross. It keeps my mind off things.
1697,oh that's great to hear! i work as an English teacher.
1697,"OH, I'm a teacher too! I sub on the high School level."
1697,"Oh that's fun, teachers are some of the most underpaid people in the world."
1697,Don't we know it-lol!
1697,i love my job i enjoy story telling
1697,What grade do you teach?
1697,"third grade , so all of them . how about you ?"
1697,Mostly High School AP classes. I actually have my PhD.
1697,oh wow! thats great! it was really nice to chat with a teacher 
1697,Thank-you. I'm thinking about applying for a full time position.
1697,You go for it!
1698,She came back home with a boyfriend!
1698,Oh! that is pretty nice to come home too.
1698,She's excited.  We're going out for sushi tonight to get to know him.  Sushi is my favorite
1698,Me too! I love sushi and that seafood in common in some of their dishes.
1698,There are so many variations!  The best I've had was in England when I went to visit my brother
1698,Are there any other types of seafood you like?
1698,"I have yet to try a seafood I don't like, honestly.  As long as it's not super fishy I love it all"
1698,"That's pretty neat, what other kind of food do you like? I love pizza because with red sauce, because I love red!"
1698,Pizza is always a good choice.  I really love a good salad with lots of different vegetables in it
1698,i really like salads but lately i'm finding it hard to find good ones .
1698,I make a lot at home so I can have more variety in them.  It's hard to find good ones in restaurants
1698,"Well, I think that the best way to go actually. Trying to find good ones in restaurants or the market can be really difficult."
1699,"Yes, I can't wait!  When is the last time you went to the beach?"
1699,Last week. I love plaingy video games
1699,"Woo nice, do you live near the beach?"
1699,"No, I live near the coast.  I am ready for anything that happens though."
1699,What kind video games do you play?
1699,mario kart . I play while at work. i work at a hotel.
1699,Fun! I played it with my coworkers last week.  What is your favorite food?
1699,big mac for sure . i wish i was on the beach though
1699,big mac mmm...I love anything with beef!
1699,Yes I love McDonalds for sure 
1699,Do you have any pets?
1699,Nope I want a dog.
1700,I've been busy shopping today. What are you doing?
1700,I was out with some friends when gang members pointed a gun at us.  Not fun at all.
1700,Oh dear! How awful! Was anyone hurt?
1700,"Nobody was hurt luckily.  I love my wife and kids, so am really happy that nothing happened."
1700,Were you robbed? 
1700,"No, they just left like nothing happened.  I normally work from home doing various jobs on the internet, and was just taking a break."
1700,I'm glad you all are okay. Last night I heard police sirens for 2 hours straight & there was nothing on the news to say what it was.
1700,That's strange.  Sometimes there are community pages on Facebook that you can join which can provide insight into topics such as those.
1700,I turned a police scanner app. They were chasing an armed robber who was on foot around where I live. It was scary. Not as scary as yours tho.
1700,It's a real shame that people can't just behave themselves.  Seems like no place is safe anymore.
1700,My dogs got pretty excited by everything and it got a little noisy in my house for a while. I let them bark in case the robber was nearby.
1700,Probably a good idea.  Robbers often times just pass by houses with dogs.
1701,I think he was just crazy for money. they were giving him $5000 to do it
1701,I would like that much money! That's the only way you could get me to do that!
1701,"so you'd eat a sandwich full of spiders for $5000? I'd have to really think about that, I usually eat pretty healthy...."
1701,"It really depends on the kind of spiders and how big they were. But for $5000, I think I'd consider it!"
1701,"yeah it's my job to help people travel around the world, so maybe I could send you to a country with tiny spiders to help you stomach it"
1701,I wouldn't hate that too much. Maybe I would learn to like the taste! What do you do for a living? 
1701,been working as a travel agent for a few years now. honestly it's getting me down...hard to see people travel so much when I never do!
1701,"I can totally relate. I dont even have a car right now, so I never even get out of town. Do you get travel discounts? "
1701,"I do! right now it's a 3% discount, but in 2 years it'll be upgraded to 5%!"
1701,Awesome. Where would you go when you do get a chance to travel? 
1701,oh I'm thinking Kentucky
1701,I've never been there. Where would you want to visit there? 
1702,"yeah, I am really shy but I love to sing so I decided to give it a try"
1702,Sometimes I find that practicing in front of friends helps with the shyness.
1702,"wow thats a great idea, I have never thought of doing that,  thanks! So what do you like to do?"
1702,I like to read and go hiking.  What about you?
1702,"Oh I love hiking! I like to sing, mostly to myself and dogs, and spend time at the beach"
1702,The beach is a great place to relax as long as the weather is nice.
1702,"yes very true, its my favorite time of year to visit the beach since the weather isn't hot but isn't cold either, what is y0ur favorite beach?"
1702,"Cape Canaveral, you get to see the Rocket launches and the cruise ships leave."
1702,"cool, I have never been there, in fact I have never been on a cruise either"
1702,"I have been on a few, you would love them.  They cater to you but sometimes are crowded."
1702,well i do love to travel so maybe next time i will try a cruise
1702,Maybe a cruise to nowhere would be good for you.  They are less expensive and only last 2-3 nights.  Could be fun.
1702,a cruise to nowehere? sounds exciting!
1703,Do you work in Art museum
1703,"I wish I did! Sadly not, I only visit them."
1703,then what is your other interest
1703,"I love to watch television, mainly ""The Voice"". I catch it every night it's on."
1703,"I dont have a idea about The Voice,what is that "
1703,It's this reality show that's kinda like American Idol. People sing and there's judges that rate them.
1703,"In which Tv channel,if i find time i will try to watch"
1703,It's on NBC!
1703,Do they really pic talented people through the program
1703,"They do! A lot of the people auditioning aren't that great, but they always nominate the best ones."
1703,Is it like for dance or what ever talent they have can be performed
1703,"It's for singing, although some contestants dance as well."
1704,I like Steven Tyler.
1704,I like some of his songs.
1704,Which ones?
1704,"I can't remember the name, but it's a slow love song."
1704,"The one from the movie.... Armageddon.  ""I dont' wanna miss a thing""?"
1704,That's the one! It's great!
1704,"Yes. What about ""Dude looks like a lady""? It was on the Mrs. Doubtfire soundtrack. LOL"
1704,I love that movie.
1704,"me too, its hilarious. I like Robin Williams movies typically."
1704,"Agreed, he was a great Canadian-American actor."
1704,I don't think he is Canadian?
1704,I don't know either to be honest.
1705,How many years difference for each kid
1705,About 2 years or more
1705,Then it will be very difficult to take care of them 
1705,"It definitely is, but I always try my hardest to raise them right."
1706,Not really.  I'm not a fan of having a job.
1706,well what do you do for money then?
1707,"yes, i head the same "
1707,have you tried it?
1707,"ye, I am feeling very well"
1707,"That's good, have you been having trouble since then?"
1707,No. It is very important for me to do exercise
1707,oh awesome! exercise is really good for your mental heath
1707,Exercises and interacting with other people help me feel better
1707,me too
1707, how do you feel?
1708,yeah my discount theater is showing Pain and Gain. I'm a bodybuilder so I really love that movie!
1708,I am not familiar with that one probably because im an old man lol
1708,yeah it's just about weightlifters committing a crime haha. what movies do you like?
1708,I like action and drama movies for the most
1708,"what about superheroes? my favorite is the Flash, I hope he gets a movie soon!"
1708,Isnt he the star of a new tv show?
1708,yep but I demand movies in addition to the TV show!
1708,Lol what about The joker have you seen it?
1708,"I did actually. I thought it was pretty good, but I liked King of Comedy better (which it was heavily inspired by)"
1708,"I didnt know that, i will have to look into it"
1708,yeah if you liked Joker you'll love it
1708,Thats great i love learning about new movies
1709,Yes. I love plays. Local theatre is a pleasure to watch.
1709,Any favorite actors?
1709,I don't usually remember the names to be honest. Or do you mean Hollywood actors?
1709,Whichever is your favorites.
1709,I like movies as well.  I like Robin Williams. I am goign to watch Mrs. Doubtfire today.
1709,I love that movie.
1709,Its very funny.  I also really enjoyed him in the Birdcage.
1709,I never saw that one.
1709,You should watch it!  
1709,i might have to .
1709,my favourite character is the one played by Hank Azaria.
1709,What makes him your favorite?
1709,"He plays a character named Agador and he has some very comical moments, hes a loveable character"
1710,"Even so I managed to spend the day without problems, I think I'm great with children haha"
1710,Not always easy to get along with a person who has left the relationship.
1710,"It's true, it's really complicated to deal with that conflict."
1710,Funny how it once was wine and roses and then it is gone.
1710,"I guess everything has a stage, even the stage of loving oneself as innocent teenagers .."
1710,You are right. Funny how your partner straying from the relationship makes it your problem.
1710,"well that's the deal when accepting a relationship. ""Your problems are mine now"" but also the joys, you may see the good stage if you manage to endure this."
1710,"Sometimes it just does not make sense, but it could be a fun ride until then."
1710,"Of course it can be, everything depends on oneself to some degree. Maybe creating a hobby between the two would be great. For example, I love drawing with my partner."
1710,I think you are on the right track. Something to keep the interest. Good for you.
1710,"Thank you, everything is a work in progress. Better to enjoy between times haha. I hope you can clarify your ideas friend"
1710,I hope so too. Nice chatting with you today. Good luck.
1710,"A pleasure, see you later."
1711,That exactly how I feel. I build computers for a living and I always try to do it through the eyes of what my kids would like. 
1711,Do you also do the building configuring an hardware as well?
1711,I used to e a mechanic. It's a lot easier than doing that for 6 years. 
1711,I can believe that. I just like simple things like staying in and watching horror movies
1711,That's one of my favorite things also. What other hobbies do you have. 
1711,I do a lot of hiking and rock climbing in my spare time on pretty days
1711,I don't think I could be a rock climber but I do love hiking. 
1711,Rock climbing is actually not scary unless you're afraid of heights of course.
1711,That's exactly why I can't do it. 
1711,"My sister is the opposite of you. She has a head for heights - she could dance along a cliff edge, it wouldn't bother her a bit."
1711,She is definitely braver than I am. I would faint and fall over the edge. 
1711,It's worth it for the views in my opinion.  What do you do in your spare time?
1712,Captain is a really jolly guy in movies lol.
1712,"Yes, I agree! Have you seen The Avengers Infinity War movie?"
1712,"Yes, I kind of liked it.  Was not that impressed."
1712,What's your favorite Avenger movie?
1712,I really liked Iron man 1 and Captain Marvel
1712,Those movies are awesome. I'm definitely a big Iron Man fan. 
1712,Robert Downey Jr is a great actor.  Did you like any of the DC movies.  I only liked Aquaman.
1712,I like the Justice League and Batman v. Superman was pretty good too.
1712,Everyone hates on Ben Affleck but I do not think he was that bad as Batman
1712,"Hahaha yea, I agree. He was decent. "
1712,I loathe Christian Bale.  Any movie he is in.
1712,"Really? What do you think of the new Spiderman, Tom Holland?"
1713,"not too many right now, where it is getting colder, they have all migrated south for the winter"
1713,What species of birds are they?
1713,just wild ones. I love seeing the cardinals. I have always heard if you see a cardinal it means someone from heaven is visiting you. I always see 2
1713,It's amazing!! I've never seen that and I wish to see that.
1713,okay. thanks for the reminder. How is the weather where you are from? 
1713,"It's getting hotter day by day here in Adelaide,Australia and wishing if spring could stay longer."
1713,"It's fall here, so winter will be here before we know it. I wish it was still summer. I love the heat, not humidity thought, kills my asthma"
1713,"I enjoy winter more, as temperature doesn't drop significantly here. By the way, where are you from?  "
1713,I am from Kentucky. So we get all the seasons. It can be 90 degrees one day and 50 the next. 
1713,How frequently it rains there? 
1713,"depends. we just went through a 40 day no rain spell, completely sunny, and 90...all grass was dead, i love that part no mowing/weedeating"
1713,I love rain but not a day to lay on the grass. 
1713,"I love listening to the rain, but hate the smell haha"
1714,I will look around and see if my public library has them
1714,I just read the whole series again myself. They are definitely worth checking out!
1714,I kinda remember reading something in high school about a ring  and hobbits.
1714,"The books definitely get a lot more involved than that. There are movies based on them too, which could give you a feel for the characters."
1714,I hardly ever watch movies based on books not close for the most part
1714,I agree. The books are almost always better.
1714,"I just finished reading a Terry Pratchett book ""men at arms"""
1714,"That sounds interesting, I'll have to check it out. My mom was a teacher so she instilled in me a great love of reading."
1714,almost all of the Terry Pratchett books are very good great characters and stories
1714,"I've read Good Omens, I appreciated that."
1714,I started reading Lords and Ladies who knew the truth about horseshoes!!
1714,What's the truth about horseshoes?
1715,I agree. That is so sad. We adopted our cat from a shelter. Do you have any pets?
1715,I have two dogs that were rescues. All my animals have always been rescues. I don't believe in breeding pets at all.
1715,"Me neither. We keep our cat strictly indoors to keep her safe, warm and dry. I may like being out in the rain, but no way she does, lol."
1715,"My dogs are sisters. One doesn't mind the rain, but the other will hold it till her eyes cross if it's raining outside. It's funny."
1715,Silly dog! So what kind of things do you enjoy doing? I love watching old movies from like the 30s and 40s.
1715,I like tv that was made in the 90s. Lots of good plots and great acting. None of that reality garbage that's everywhere now.
1715,"Yeah, reality TV really is trash I think. Entertainment seems to have gone downhill. Give me the classics. I love anything black and white, esp with Rita Hayworth"
1715,She was gorgeous. She did a lot of tragic stories if I remember correctly.
1715,"Oh yes, Cover Girl Gilda, Affair in Trinidad. Classics. What 90s shows did you like? Friends?"
1715,Right now I'm binge watching NYPD Blue. It was such a great show. All time favorite was the X Files tho.
1715,I loved X Files. Esp episodes with the Lone Gunmen. I love that Netflix lets us go back and revisit all those shows. What else do you do for fun?
1715,"I even liked that Lone Gunmen spinoff they did, but sadly it didn't make it on its own. I like to read, paint, write & play games. You?"
1716,I love coffee I need it 24/7
1716,"I rarely drink it although I do drink power drinks, I am never out of the gym and always playing raquetball so i need the energy"
1716,I try to go to the gym but I work with computers for a living so you would say i'm a bit of a techie
1716,That must be intersting. But as you say its a sit down job.  Do you listen to music while you work?
1716,I love music what about yourself?  I also like tall woman that's my second favorite thing
1716,I listen to most music excepy country and jazz. I like tall women too!
1716,I like a lot of Rock and Metal but will listen to other genres except for country and jazz as well
1716,"I like rock as well, although I can listen to classical just as much! Do you play any instruments?"
1716,"no I tried guitar when I was younger but I was awful at it, what about you?"
1716,"No, I have no talent in that direction at all! My mother is a fantastic pianist though. I guess the gene missed me."
1717,Who is your favourite tennis player?
1717,Definitely Federer for me. You've probably watch him a bunch since he wont eights times at Wimbledon.
1717,I like Serena Williams. It was a wild ride to watch her last match leading to her retirement.
1717,Yes. Serena is an all time great. She has been #1 for 319 weeks.
1717,"Well she was, yes."
1717,Lot's of players are trying to live up to her records I think.
1717,Bianca Andreescu pulled off a big win against Williams. I think it was an upset for alot of people.
1717,Probably because she has so many fans.
1717,I think its nice to see new talent make their way up the ranks.
1717,I agree. They can push records even further than their predecessors.
1717,"Yes, its very interesting how the bar keeps getting higher and higer."
1717,Definitely. Hopefully the next World Cup will surprise just as much.
1717,Very exciting stuff going on in the world of tennis. Golf oto
1718,oh that's cool.
1718,"Is that true the license plates carry the state motto, "
1718,I don't think so. have you seen any?
1718,"not when i was there , but i've heard there are many"
1718,I have not seen any so far.
1718,I have seen them
1718,"Ok, do you like it?"
1718,"A lot, I love it"
1718,sounds cool.
1718,It definitely reflects the history of the United States
1718,I think you are right.
1718,have you ever been here ?
1718,I have never been there.
1719,What's even more surpising is I have crashed my CAR 2 times as well.
1719,That is terrible at least you are alive and well. 
1719,Yes!  I don't know what I would do if I couldn't play my sports and get out for some air.
1719, Yea I love playing sports but I also really love to read. Do you like to read?
1719,I don't really read much.  Which do you prefer? Sports or reading?
1719,I like to do both. The best book I have read is ender s game. Have you heard of it?
1719,I've never heard of it. What is it about?
1719,I don't want to give away the story. I recommend you pick up a copy and read it. 
1719,I will do that if I can ever get time away from my outdoor sports.
1719,Thats awesome. What is your favorite sport?
1719,Football.  I love American Football.
1719,I'm more of a football fan I love the Cowboys
1720,My dad who is a doctor gave me his friends restored Mustang.
1720,you have a great dad
1720,Thanks he's the best.
1720,I hope to be a doctor someday- I'm currently taking some classes online.
1720,Wow that's awesome. Is it hard?
1720,"it is difficult but i do enjoy it , just takes a lot of studying"
1720,Cool. Do you have any hobbies
1720,"Yes, I love to garden. Roses are my favorite!"
1720,Really me to. I have a lot of veggies and flowers.
1720,"I am going to start my veggie garden next spring. I live in Florida, so I have to start and end early."
1720,Lol yeah Texas is the same. It was nice talking to you.
1720,Nice talking to you too and bet of luck with your garden!
1720,Thanks you too. bye
1721,o yes now i know who he is
1721,Hawking was the first person in history to put into the world a theory of cosmology
1721,Did he ever speak in vegas? I want to move there
1721,I'm not sure.  What draws you to Vegas?
1721,The fact that it is lively 24 hours a day
1721,Well it seems like a place everyone should check out!
1721,"Thats true, if you could choose anywhere to live where would it be"
1721,I would choose the mountains of North Carolina or Tennessee
1721,those sound like nice secluded places
1721,That's exactly what I want!  To be surrounded by nature
1721,sounds great I am tired of being surrounded by neighbors lol
1721,It will be a while before I can move because I just started college
1722,"it was pretty difficult, I am a little anxious"
1722,I get that with tests. I test anxiety.
1722,so how was your day?
1722,"My day was great, Its so busy and all with fixing cars which is rewarding because it also pays well."
1722,"oh that sounds great, so you are pretty handy with cars?"
1722,"i try . it is a work in progress , but i am confident !  I love listening to music while I work"
1722,what sort of music do you like listening to?
1722,I like all sorts of music but mostly alternative rock - Creed is my favorite band.  How about yoU?
1722," I am the same, my playlist is very eclectic with a bit of everything really! Even some Creed i think! My all time favorite band is Foo Fighters"
1722,I love Foo Fighters.  Although the name is not great.  What are you studying?
1722,"Marketing and Comms. I kind of fell into it and I wouldn't say it's my passion, but we will see where it takes me..."
1722,Oh that's cool. Where do you study?  It's important to get a degree
1723,What is that about?
1723,"It is about the people's struggle with never ending war, constant government surveillance, and public manipulation."
1723,"Oh wow, that sounds fascinating. And relevant to today's time."
1723,I have read some history books about the american civil war its amazing how long this has been going on
1723,Definitely. I worry that there will be another massive war like that in the future.
1723,What both sides did was incredible.  Lincoln had people thrown in jail for disagreeing with the war much like FDR put japanes americans in camps
1723,It's terrible that powerful people jail others just for disagreeing. My son is very outspoken about politics and it makes me concerned for him.
1723,the founding fathers put everything on the line for this country a little bit of free speech is not dangerous
1723,"I agree. I enjoy reading all different types of books for that reason, to get many perspectives."
1723,Live and let live was a uniquely american idea seems to have been put aside its all conflict and drama all the time
1723,I agree. I hope we can see a more peaceful world in the future.
1723,Man has a ways to go before we put aside our tendencies to fight
1724,I mostly like to stay inside and browse the internet. I love going outside in the winter though.
1724,I browse the internet a good amount as well. I'm more of a Summer person myself though.
1724,That's cool. What do you like doing in the summer?
1724,I love just going outdoors for walks with my dog. He's loves the heat and suntanning.
1724,The apartment complex I'm in doesn't allow dogs! A dog would help me get out more.
1724,"They're definitely good for that, haha! Mine wants to go outside so often."
1724,What kind of dog is it?
1724,A Jack Russel. He's adorable but can definitely be a bit feisty at times.
1724,"They are adorable. My parents only ever bought Boston Terriers, so I grew up around them."
1724,"I've grown up with quite a few dogs over the years, haha. "
1724,Lucky you! I've been stuck with the same old breed and now I cant even't get one.
1724,"My mother lived in an apartment complex and wasn't supposed to have a new dog, but she snuck one in anyway and they turned the other cheek, haha."
1725,I love pancakes with syrup!   I enjoy organic maple syrup!
1725,Organic is the best.  That makes it healthy in a way.
1725,"I have to eat certain things, mostly all healthy to maintain my physical shape"
1725,that's good . being physically fit is healthy to the mind too .
1725,Yes!   I have been doing yoga in the morning to clear my mind before practice
1725,That's a good idea.  Have you been doing it long?
1725,I started Yoga when I took a vacation to Bali a few years ago after the season was over.
1725,"Oh, Bali! I love Bali, there are over 4 million people there and it is home to most of Indonesia's Hindu minority!"
1725,I would one day love to retire to Bali!    Every person there is so grounded and peaceful
1725,That sounds like a great idea!  A beautiful place and wonderful people would be very relaxing.
1725,Yes!   Have you been often?
1725,No i have never been but i hope i am able to one day.
1725,Everyone should have the opportunity to go at least one time!
1726,"yes, most of the time."
1726,"I always try to improve my abilities, to make myself a better person within myself"
1726,That is good but i can not say the same for myself.
1726,"It is a struggle, with all the obstacles life throws at us daily. I just focus on one thing at a time, that I want to improve. "
1726,"I really want to be like that, can you share me some tips?"
1726,"Pray about it. Ask yourself what do you want to improve on. I want to improve my self worth, so I focus on what I am good at ."
1726,"That is a good suggestions, i really appreciate it."
1726,"You're welcome. Stay true to yourself, if there is something that you need to change to become a better you, own it, and work from there"
1726,Understand.
1726,"i've had to look in the in the mirror and okay Lord what do i need to work on, point it out to me "
1726,It is a good idea to lookup to God in time of crisis.
1726,"yea, although I do fail more often than i admit, but admitting our faults is the first step into changing ourselves"
1727,That's cool! I like playing football and reading.
1727,Reading is great.  I am a children's librarian.  
1727,Nice! what's your favourite book?
1727,"The Hobbit, what is yours?"
1727,Would have to be Noam Chomsky's Manafacturing consent
1727,"you know , i think we may have a book like that at my library ."
1727,You should have a read. I love him.
1727,I will look him up.  Are you married?
1727,"No I'm only 20, are you?"
1727,I just got divorced.  I am ok with it though.
1727,Better off without the excess baggage ey. I'm sure you can do much better anyway.
1727,"yes , i guess so . i need to think that way ."
1728,yes i love to drink tea with my wife of eight years
1728,"I would rather have tea than coffee, but that's not usual in the US, at least among the people I know."
1728,i see do you have any kids?
1728,I don't have any kids. Do you?
1728,yes 3 and i am 32 years old
1728,So they're still fairly young then? I bet you all look forward to the holidays.
1728,of course we have lots of fun as a family
1728,Do you go trick or treating?
1728,yup every year one of my favorite holidays
1728,Saw a picture of a guy in a group of Halloween witches wearing a Manwich costume. It was hilarious.
1728,sounds funny i was a pumpkin last year
1728,That's great. I went as Princess Leia because I already had the wig. What are you doing this year?
1729,"Yes, and I also have four grandchildren. "
1729,"neat! How old are they? I have a dog, I like their unique interaction with human behavior."
1729,"The youngest is seven, then 10, 14, and 30. :) What is your dog's name? "
1729,My dog's name is Doodles. Do you grandkids live close by? 
1729,"That is a cute name! Yes, they are close by. My youngest grandchild reads to our dog and he seems to enjoy it. We both love books. "
1729,It's always nice to get lost in a good book.  One of my favorite hobbies.
1729,Me too! Have you taught Doodles any tricks? My dog Wiggles can sit and stay. 
1729,He can do roll over as well as sit and stay. He is very smart!
1729,"Yes, he must be! That's impressive."
1729,"yes it is, it took a lot of work . so what else do you like?"
1729,I like to volunteer at the library. What do you enjoy in your free time? 
1729,"I do read occasionally, do you?"
1729,"Yes, often. "
1730,It just went fine. Never expected much out of that.
1730,"Yeah, I get that. Sometimes you can meet new people and learn new stuff though. At least, hopefully. "
1730,"Sometimes, you learn great deal. However, you should never keep unrealistic expectations. I always follow that.. "
1730,"Yeah, and shouldn't necessarily trust something someone tells you without verifying it. "
1730,"That's 100 percent true, validate every bit of it, never trust blindly. it may put one in trouble."
1730,"I find that true of everything I read online, but maybe Im just paranoid lol, who knows. "
1730,"I agree, almost every other information is from unverifiable source, who knows, who's frustrated mind you're read to. "
1730,I think most people dont even realize when they are reading and repeating bad information. They just accept it as fact. 
1730,"I always try to consider original resources, which are reviewed thoroughly. I always suggest others to do the same. "
1730,That really sounds like a great way to do it. I try to figure out what a writer's bias and agenda is when considering new information. 
1730,Yeah! and another aspect to that is writer's credibility and previous publications. 
1730,Precisely. I try to find a small number of sources I think I can trust and go to those. 
1730,Great way to save precious time!
1731,I try to ignore the unhealthy side and just enjoy the taste
1731,sometime you can get both my doctor took away most sugars i feel better than ever
1731,Really? I always thought cutting out sugar wouldn't make a big difference.
1731,Yes it does.  She also explained how to eat during certain times of the day to help your pancreas stay healthy
1731,"Oh wow, unfortunately I don't think I have enough self control to change my diet."
1731,Getting rid of temptation in the kitchen helps ALOT.  no sodas no cookies no ice cream that is not sugar free
1731,But how do I get rid of the temptation at the grocery store?
1731,Buy the basic ingredients and make it yourself.  all the prepackaged foods have sugar or corn syrup somewhere in them
1731,"Well, I did just start that food delivery service. Where they deliver you healthy food to cook."
1731,Thats a good start
1731,"Yeah, I had a discount. It seems a little expensive to keep ordering food online though."
1731,Maybe you can get the ingredients at the local market and make your own
1732,What are some of your favorite ingredients? 
1732,It has to be lentils! I absolutely love lentils!
1732,I like them as well. They are delicious in Indian dishes. 
1732,Aso great on their own! Add some garlic and chicken stock and voila!
1732,That does sound good. I will try that and take it to the hospital with me for lunch.
1732,Really simple and easy. Are you vegetarian? 
1732,"No, not completely. I still eat meat but only a few times a week."
1732,"Best of both worlds, I guess. "
1732,I feel it is better for my long term health to avoid it. What about you?
1732,"Yeah, I agree. I'm a vegetarian, have been for about 6 months. "
1732,Was the change for health reasons or something else? 
1732,Mainly because I don't agree with large industrial corporate farming. 
1733,Yes! it's really cool i really like to play slackware
1733,Its an interesting game most people like playing.
1733,"Most of all because of the plot of the game, it is very entertaining!"
1733,Do you know the different forms of the game?
1733,And it is! and you?
1733,I read about it but i haven't touched it. 
1733,"But you played, right?"
1733,"Yes, you?"
1733,"Of course, yes, how not to play it if it is my favorite!"
1733,what other game do you like?
1733,Some of the ones I like not as much as slackware is runescape
1733,oh that's cool.
1734,"He's 2, it's been a long time since I managed to go out by myself."
1734,its a shame you can't go out. i love walking
1734,"I do too. I went for a long walk around my neighborhood, had coffee with a friend, got a book from the library, and got some McDonald's french fries."
1734,did your son go with you?
1734,"No, that was when he was with the babysitter. I wanted some time just for myself and friends."
1734,you should take him on a walk too. he'll like it
1734,"Oh, we go for walks often. But it's nice to not have to worry about him for a couple hours."
1734,thats good. do you sing to him?
1734,"I do, my family is from Japan so I sing him traditional Japanese lullabies."
1734,great. i love singing and its good for babies
1734,"He seems to enjoy it, he often smiles and giggles."
1734,just dont give him mcdonalds till he's older
1735,He is a Congress man that was accused of making sexual comments. I'm a female and I hate him
1735,Oh that's disgusting. Is he in a position of power?
1735,Yes he is. Its about time for breakfast. What did you eat?
1735,"I had a toasted hokkaido milk bread, top with some cream cheese spread and I sprinkle it also sesame seasoning. It's scrumptious!"
1735,That sounds great. I love omelets as long as they don'y have tomatoes.  
1735,"I actually do not like tomatoes even though I will eat ketchup and spaghetti sauce. I think a tomato has a weird flavor by itself, LOL"
1735,Me too. I don't like tomatoes at all.
1736,I was so emotional.  Do you have any children?
1736,No i do not. But i wish someday after getting married i will have my own. Do you like kids?
1736,"Yes, I have always dreamed of having many.  So far just one."
1736,I would like to but right now I just live by myself
1736,Maybe someday you will be ready for it.  Do you like video games?
1736,"I do, I used to play growing up."
1736,I am a big fan of Mortal Kombat.  I even love the corny movies they put out.  With Chris Lambert.
1736,i agee. i used to loooove playing mortal kombat.
1736,did you have a favorite character?
1736,My favorite Mortal Kombat character is Mileena.
1736,OMG that is my favorite character too!!!
1736,Do you like instruments?  I play the guitar myself
1737,"I enjoy rock music too, but my marriage and children take up a lot of my free time."
1737,do you have a favorite band ? i love metallica .
1737,I would say my favorite is Kiss.
1737,Oh I like them too. I like that song I think it is called 
1737,Mine is Nowhere to Run which is fitting since I despise running.
1737,that is mine as well i really like the acustics on that song
1737,My kids hate it when I blare my 45s of Kiss.
1737,hahaha I bet they do!
1737,My husband walks around on Saturdays with earplugs in his ears.  
1737,That's where earmuffs or plugs come in handy my friend
1737,He had to learn that the hard way.  LOL
1737,haha well they do learn along the way
1738,That sounds really cool! Maybe when I grow up I can be a swimmer!
1738,I believe the sooner you start the better it is ! It also depends upon your passion for the sport.
1738,What do you like to do?
1738,"I like watching olympic swimming, I enjoyed watching Michael Phelps swim the most I think."
1738,Michael Phels is one of my heroes! Did you know he broke a world record for swimming at 15!
1738,"Yes, he is amazing!  But he's retired  now I think but he's the most decorated Olympian of all time!"
1739,What are your favorite genres in particular?
1739,"I like rock and pop usually, but I really will listen to anything. "
1739,What would you say is the weirdest thing you listened to?
1739,Probably the music my little ones listen to. I have five kids and their music is really bad.
1739,"Haha, what kind of music do they listen to?"
1739,It is the basic learning music made for kids. Lots of it has other children singing.
1740,Tell me about you.
1740,I love hiking and spending time outdoors. I feel best when I'm in nature. My mom teaches at the college I'm attending. 
1740,"Wow, thats really interesting. My favorite food is friend chiken. How about you?"
1740,Fried chicken is one of my favorites too! I also like pizza and Thai food. Do you have a favorite dessert? 
1740,I like eating ice-cream with my sister Jessica. We are really close. How is your family?
1740,My family is doing well. Are you older or younger than your sister? 
1740,We are twins! Although she is technicaly older then me.
1740,"That is so cool! I'm an only child and always wished for a sister, but it must be challenging sometimes too. "
1740,"We get along quiet well, its nice."
1740,Do you enjoy spending time outdoors? I'm going on a nature walk later today. The weather is nice here. 
1740,"Yes i do, mostly bikes but also enjoy riding horses"
1740,Do you have horses of your own? I've only been horseback riding once and it was a lot of fun. 
1741,Channing Tatum is a wonderful actor and so nice to watch.  
1741,"He was good in Magic Mike, that's a real fun movie."
1741,I saw both Magic Mike and Magic Mike the sequel. Those were great.
1741,Do you go to the movies often?
1741,No I normally wait for them to come out on Netflix or Prime and watch them at home.  
1741,I live in a big city with lots of different movie places showing all sorts of films so I go a lot
1741,"I'm really not a movie theater person.  I like to be in my home, comfortable and watch without others bothering me."
1741,I watch netflix as well but I like the huge screen and sound quality.
1741,"I agree that the big screen and sound quality is better at the movies, but I hate the noise from the other people.  "
1741,That's true - other people can be really annoying... and not just in the theatre!
1741,Did you know that Channing Tatum put himself through college with the job of male stripper.
1741,"I didn't. Hey, good for him if it got him where he is today!"
1742,Yes! Now I have a bunch of flashlights also
1742,"I used to use a nightlight when I was a kid.  I was afraid of the dark, but now that I'm older I don't need it."
1742,When I have to go and check the greenhouse at night I really like a big bright flashlight
1742,"MY dad was a cop, so there was always a bunch of flashlights in our house!"
1742,Best lights are cop lights.  The local raccoons like my tomatoes a bit too much have caught them stealing at night
1742,"OH-LOL Those raccoons can be pesky. I live in Florida where there are a lot of gators. I water ski, so they scare me!"
1742,Anything that can chomp on a small dog in one bite would scare me too!
1742,"Yeah, I pretty much grew up in the water when gators were endangered. Now, they are everywhere!"
1742,Can you eat them?
1742,Some people do. I don't care for the taste myself.
1742,Probably taste just like chicken as the joke goes
1742,Sort of. People fry the meat like chicken nuggets!
1743,Really don't know what to do in those situations. Any advice? 
1743,no nothing i try seems to help
1743,Sometimes ignoring is the best solution.
1743,My mom says I should be more patient.  Maybe you should try that.
1743,I will try that. Thanks for the advice. What' s the weather like this days?
1743,Super hot and sunny. How about the weather where you are?
1743,Foggy and cold. Not a big fan of days like this.
1743,I get it.  One of my things is race cars.  You don't get to see much racing in weather like that.
1743,O really? That's cool. 
1743,Do you ever watch racing on the tv?
1743,Nope
1743,You really should. I've done some research on the different types of cars. It's amazing what all goes into them!
1744,so how you we can solve it
1744,"Maybe get an assessment done at a psychiatric hospital by a psychiatrist, psychologist and/or a clnical social worker. There are tests that can be done, or simple observation and questioning."
1744,"When something terrible happens to a friend or loved one, it can be situations, the following list may help you find a better response"
1744,I am not sure what you mean by situations.  But it is never good when something happens to a friend or loved one.
1745,Do you like music? I love singing.
1745,"Yeah, music is great. But what I really love is to ride horses. Such magnificent animals."
1745,That's really cool. I would love to go horseback riding with my boyfriend.
1745,Just do it. what is holding you back?
1745,I've never done it before! Is it hard?
1745,It takes some learning. So what music do you like?
1745,I love pop music and musicals. What about you?
1745,I listen to contemporary Christian music most of the time. What do you do? What is your profession?
1745,"I'm a secretary at a big corporation, so I just like to sing in my spare time. What do you do for work?"
1745,I am an accountant but my husband is a teacher and my mother was a teacher too before she retired.
1745,Accounting is a really great profession. You must be really good with numbers?
1745,I am but someday I wonder if I should teach too. It is so gratifying to reach kids and touch their lives.
1746,I study business administration. I go to college part time
1746,Oh that's cool. Where do you study?
1746,at one of the most prestigious university in Boston. I will be graduating this year with honors
1746,i just finished my studying . i attend boston university .
1746,"Oh, wow! We're attending the same university, LOL. What did you study? Where did you hang out around the campus?"
1746,"yea small world, i studied business administration"
1746,What class are you? How come I never meet you?
1746,"i graduated in 2015 buddy, do you like the red sox?"
1746,"Yes, absolutely. I almost always wear a T-shirt with their logo and old jeans "
1746,"cool, they are my favorite, my best friend growing up got me into them"
1746,who is your favorite player?
1746,"it is tough to have a favorite player , but i've a team ! do you ?"
1747,Actually what I was going to carry was very heavy
1747,You're a good friend for helping him!  I always have my two kids help me move stuff
1747,Sure! You always have to help others
1747,It always makes me feel good to help other people.  I also have 2 dogs who I love to spoil which also helps to feel good
1747,Great! What breed are your dogs?
1747,Both are rescue shepherd mutts.  Do you have any pets?
1747,"If I have a dog, German Shepherd"
1747,"Nice I love German Shephards! They are cute when puppies and monsters when they grow up, my kind of dog"
1747,"Yes! Like me, besides being beautiful, they are excellent pets, and good friends to make company"
1747,They are so loving and protective of their pack
1747,"Well yes, and tell me you like rock?"
1747,"I like classic rock, but not the new hard rock"
1748,Yes they are!  It's so much fun watching those races with my dog because he watches them too.
1748,That has to be funny. 
1748,Yes it is actually!  Do you have a favorite driver?
1748,My favorite driver is Kevin Harvick. 
1748,"I like him too, but my favorite is Denny Hamlin"
1748,I used to watch him with my dad! 
1748,One year I went to a race with my Dad and i had to leave the dog home for a little bit while we were at the race.
1748,"I am sure you dog was sad about that. Hey, what's your favorite kind of music?"
1748,"Yeah, but they were very happy when i got home!  I like Rock"
1748,"I like rock too, but my favorite is pop, it's easier to dance too. lol"
1748,hahaaaa... i do not Dance :-p
1748,"What?! Everybody dances. I don't dance good, but I still do it."
1748,ok... maybe a little! LOL
1748,See! It's a good stress reliever. 
1748,yeah... it's more to be sill though
1748,Yes! I love being silly. It makes me feel young again.
1748,ah yes... youth... where did you go! LOL
1749,"Fresh beats as in music, I want to make a living playing in front of an audience."
1749,Awesome!  Do you sing? Play an instrument?  
1749,Play the piano. Taught myself. How 'bout you? Do you play?
1749,No.  But my youngest daughter does.  So do you play at any places around town?
1749,"No, I have not. I am actually really shy!"
1749,Well I'd love to hear you play one day.  Do you enjoy walking in the park? I take my 3 dogs there almost every day.
1749,That I do! I take my kids weekly. They love running around and playing. 
1749,I've been looking for a woman with red hair that I met a few weeks back.  She left her book on a bench and I wanted to return it.
1749,That's like throwing a rock into a lake and hoping it hits something on the way down other then water! I'll keep my eyes open.
1749,Very true!  That park gets a lot of people passing through. 
1749,Lets go off of the book. Are there any determinable characteristics about it? Such as a library branch?
1749,Nope. I checked.  It's a classic - Adventures of Tom Sawyer. 
1750,"I am still looking at my otions but the current front runner is a Jeep Grand Cherokee, black!"
1750,NIce choice I like all Jeep products
1750,What car do you drive?
1750,"I have a Audi Q7 right now, I just bought a new mansion and keep it in the garage "
1750,"oh nice, does your chauffeur drive it or do you?"
1750,lol no I am not that rich
1750,haha i'm just kidding. do you have a big family?
1750,I'm only kidding lol
1750,I live by myself so no mansion for me hahahaha
1750,oh okay haha well that still cool
1750,yeah i love being independent. Can get a little lonely at times though. Do you live with anyone?
1750,"No one, just my cat ha"
1751,but would you say Chevrolet is a brand worth buying?
1751,"Chevy is a division of General Motors, so it's a very good brand. They have been around for a while."
1751,"yeah, anyways it is complicated to know if it is the ideal brand or not. I don't want to make a bad expense since I will soon open a business."
1751,"Whichever brand, I have to have something that will carry the 2 children I gave birth to.  What business?"
1751,The mini van is always the winning option in your case right? hahaha I have my options reduced to a fruit market or restaurant.
1751,Either of those choices sounds good. Enjoy the fruits of your labor!
1751,"Thanks, I will do my best. And how are you doing with your wife's pregnancy?"
1751,"Well, I'm actually the wife in the marriage, and I've already had the two children I'm planning to have."
1751,"oh ups, I thought you used an analogy when expressing yourself. But how does the experience feel? I still have no plans to have them."
1751,It's amazing bringing life!
1751,I'm glad to notice the happiness I bring you.
1751,"yes , life is wonderful and we need to be grateful ."
1751,"It is certainly like that, well I have to leave a pleasure talking to you."
1752,"I know, they are stunning. i snorkled in the Great Barrier Reef in Australia about 10 years ago."
1752,"That's so cool! Did you visit many of its islands? It has 6,852 of them!"
1752,"I don't remember much, we stayed in Port Douglas and took a boat out to the reef. Have you ever been there?"
1752,I haven't! One of my favorite things about the shore is the ice cream and french fires though. They taste better for some reason!
1752,"oh yeah, nothing beats that in the dead of summer! something about the freshness of the ocean i think"
1752,"Yes, and right now the leaves are changing colors and dropping all along the shore. It's beautiful!"
1752,yes i love this time of year! although it gets very chilly there in the winter. i prefer being south for the colder months!
1752,I don't like the cold but I love to snorkel in the summers. Have you ever snorkeld?
1752,"yes, i have snorkeled on many trips, the Great Barrier Reef was the most impressive though. How about you?"
1752,I haven't been to the Great Barrier Reef but it's on my bucket list! I snorkel every summer since I was 14!
1752,nice!! do you play any musical intruments?
1752,"No I don't have much luck when it comes to playing music, do you?"
1753,"Wow, I didn't know it was that much! I love to read, so I could go through a few books a week!"
1753,"its amazing! you can browse, buy and download books right to it! you can also read newspapers, magazines and other digital media via wireless networking to the kindle store"
1753,"I'm so grateful for technology. I have anxiety and i'm afraid to go out. So, it keeps me connected."
1753,I completely understand that.  With technology you can even shop from home so you don't really have to go out.
1753,Yep! I even get my therapy on line-LOL!
1753,I have never tried one of those. Is it as good as going in person?
1753,"Well, maybe. I'll have to see. I do feel like I'm making progresss."
1753,That's great to hear!  I'm impressed and glad that technology helps you so much.  
1753,"Yes, it's better than taking medication. Also, I use social media quite a bit to keep in touch with others."
1753,In a way its safer to keep convos about and with other people on internet vs in person !
1753,"Ye, there are always security risks. I got my identity stolen a few years back."
1753,"wow , that is crazy ! that never happened to me before !"
1754,I agreed.  It also comes in so many different shades
1754,I would like to try and color my hair purple once. 
1754,I think it would be fun.  I saw someone just yesterday who had their hair purple.  
1754,I don't think that I could do it with my job at the real estate office though. I do not think it is professional enough.
1754,You could try putting just a few streaks in your hair.  That way if you pull it up no one would see it
1754,"That is a great idea, but I am too scared to lose my job over it. "
1754,"Just check with your boss about it, or better yet do it the month of breast cancer awareness."
1754,Is purple associated with beast cancer awareness? 
1754,"Well pink is, but its close enough you could get away with saying you were doing it for breast cancer"
1754,What do you do for a living?
1754,I stay at home and manage my household and everyone in it.  It's more work than I ever did at my last job
1754,I agree. Taking care of the house is a full time job.
1755,"Ah, any particular reason you're moving to London?"
1755,Its cooler than TX and its green plus so much history right there and across the channel
1755,"I see, I see. A change of pace is never really a bad thing. I could use a vacation, might travel up there some day."
1755,You should it really different than the states the food is not that good but france is right there
1755,"Ahhh, a restaurant in the heart of France sounds good right now."
1755,I know!  real FRENCH toast
1755,"Never thought of that, haha! Could go for a crepe myself, mmm."
1755,any of the regional dishes would be awesome!
1755,That's so true. Anything you're looking forward to eating often in London?
1755,The beer is different and the chips and fish are better than anything here.  England is not known for its cuisine poor blokes
1755,I'd love to sip some brew while snacking on Fish n Chips at a pub.
1755,The dark beers are really good full bodied brews lamb is everywhere compared to here I want to try some out in the country
1756,Interesting. I didn't know that. I guess I can see the connection since they both deal in the unseen. 
1756,I'm not sure it's mysticism. Its just a pseudoscientific alternative where people use crystals for medicine.
1756,What are the crystals supposed to do? Why do they use them? 
1756,"they have healing powers, i'm more into crystals"
1756,Do they provide physical or mental healing. Or both? 
1756,"both, do u like nature? are u a nature lover?"
1756,"I like being outside. I play a lot of sports and things, so I like the outdoors, but I dont know if I consider myself a nature lover necessarily. "
1756,"Well, I hope you have a lot of fun in contact with nature"
1756,I should really go on hikes more. Do you get out into nature a lot?
1756,i plan on growing my own herbs and vegetables at the moment so not out of nature
1756,Have you gardened for a long time? Is it a hobby of yours?
1756,yeh i always wanted to plant my own vegetables and herbs.
1757,"Id rather not talk about it, but i do like books. Recently ive been reading Harry Potter. What are your hobbies?"
1757,"I spedn as much time as I can at the archery centre and I ride a motorcycle to get there, its not a Harley but I love it."
1757,Thats really cool. My husband wants a motorcycle but im too scared he will get injured. Is it dangerous?
1757,Not if you know what you are doing and don't ride it like an idiot! You also must wear the proper gear. Do you think he will get one?
1757,"Maybe. I think I might buy him a book about it, that way he can educate himself. What else do you enjoy doing?"
1757,I like reading as well - all sorts of stuff from classics to thrillers.
1757,"Thats really cool, are you reading anything at the moment?"
1757,I'm actually reading a non fiction book about Charles Manson. What do your read other than Harry Potter?
1757,To Kill A Mockingbird is another favorite. Its really interesting but also eye opening.
1757,Yes that is a great book. Of mice and men is another fine classic.
1757,Have any favorite foods? Im a killer for pizza and also tacos. How about you?
1757,Chinese and KFC for me! Though I mainly try to eat healthy.
1758,it means ha ha :) ..its a Spanish word
1758,That's interesting. I love to travel the world and know a little bit of Spanish. Where are you from? 
1758,Right now I live in Miami. I sell paper products in downtown. Where are you from and what do you do?
1758,I'm in California and am retired. I spend most of my time gardening. How's the weather in Miami?  
1758,Humid and hot as always. Wow Gardening sounds so much fun. Its on my list but don't know much about it.
1758,It is a very relaxing hobby. I started with indoor cacti that are easy to care for. What sort of paper products do you sell? 
1758," Recycled ones. boxes, bags etc. Cacti sound interesting. I want to learn to grow vegetables."
1758,I use recycled products when I can. I'm growing tomatoes in biodegradable pots. :)  What vegetables would you like to grow? 
1758,"All vegetables possible! Organic tomatoes, peppers etc. But i need to learn first. Is it a good weather in California to grow vegetables?"
1758,"Yes, it's good weather for pumpkins right now. Peppers are very easy to grow in pots. You should try! "
1758,Thanks for the advice . I will start with peppers. 
1758,Do you like to cook? 
1759,okay do you play fantasy football?
1759,"I'm not really into fantasy football, I prefer video games."
1759,i like video games too what type do you play
1759,I like racing games and adventure games. I like to get into the story.
1759,oh i am into sports like 2k and madden
1759,What's Madden like?
1759,its great almost like being in the nfl
1759,"Oh ok, you seem to love sports a lot."
1759,yes i do and i am from Georgia we love football
1759,"I could never get into it, I like to read comic books and watch anime."
1759,cool thats nice do you draw as well
1759,"I like to draw , but I am not very good at it."
1760,"hi, i try to stay warm."
1760,"You should visit Texas, where I'm from.  It's warm a LOT!"
1760,"I bet it is , not sure I want to come there in the summer."
1760,It does get pretty hot but there's so much to do! I grew up riding horses here.
1760,"That sounds nice, what else is there to do down there? "
1760,"There's football of course, San Antonio has a lot of amazing things - RiverWalk, Alamo. "
1760,"Is that where you are, San Antonio?"
1760,"Actually, I'm from Dallas. But San Antonio is only a couple hours away.  Austin, our capital is a great place too!"
1760,"Oh ok, so is your favorite football team the Dallas Cowboys?"
1760,Of course!  We just went to the game last Sunday.  Great game against the Eagles.
1760,"Who won that game, let me guess. The Cowboys! "
1760,Yep!  They sure did!  
1760,Congratulations!
1761,he is just 1.5 years old
1761,That's wonderful. 
1761,yes he is look very cute 
1761,definitely. 
1761,when you look him you take him in your hand 
1761,I felt exactly the way you're feeling now when my son took his first steps years ago.
1762,"No, I took Spanish in high school, but I've forgotten it all now"
1762,I took French in school! I can't say a word in it though. I do speak Spanish. 
1762,What's your favorite sport?
1762,I like football and baseball. Mostly Football
1762,I like football but my favorite sport is baseball. What is your favorite team?
1762,"In football-the Cowboys, in Baseball- the Yankees! What about you?"
1762,"I like the Nationals and the Redskins. I live in Virginia, so they're the closest teams. "
1762,"Well if I like the team associated with my state, I would like a horrible team... The Dolphins lol"
1762,The Dolphins are pretty bad. Do you like to play sports as well?
1762,"Not to much, I like to play kickball. "
1762,That's cool. I used to play soccer sometimes but now I'm old and my knees hurt a lot. 
1762,Me tooo!!! I hate being old. Where did the time go.
1763,Hellow
1763,"It is very intense color, it represents danger, power and strength"
1763,yes; green represents earth 
1763,Thats nice I like green it makes me very happy
1763,green makes you think about natur
1763,"yeah I would agree with that, I like to read about nature especially on sunny days"
1763,yes because natur is our origin
1763,Indeed. Nature is very interesting and complex to interpret. Survival is the only mechanism that drive us to have certain physical features
1763,yes that s the theory of evolution
1763,sure is its all very interesting
1763,its an important topic to study
1763,i completely agree its very interesting learning new things .
1764,That's terrible your oldest son losing your headphone but it was yourself wow lol
1764,"No more than I speak with my brother, I thought at first it was him that lost them on purpose."
1764,i always try to retace my steps to make sure i didn't leave it somehwhere before i go blaming
1764,"True, but it's a long story with my brother. And being so poor, it's difficult to replace things like that."
1764,I agree man it hurt's badly i had that issue before i'll lose something and go off blaming others
1764,I don't like blaming others.
1764,Yeah we all do it sometimes in our life.
1764,True.  I think it's just part of being human.
1764,Yeah we can't control that part of ourself we all flawed in our own way.
1764,We tend to be harsh critics of ourselves and in the end it hurts us.
1764,Yep but you can't fault the human kind beside the ones that wanna kill others for no reason at all
1764,Ones that want to kill others for no reason at all are the worst.
1765,"Can't believe halloween is coming up, pretty weird since holidays aren't celebrated because of my religion."
1765,"My mother-in-law hates it, but we have always let our child do Halloween, we think it's pretty harmless."
1765,Have you ever seen a ghost before?
1765,No I have not but I am quite facinated with ghosts. I know that some people would worship their ancestors too.
1765,I think they're real. I only seen two before.
1765,What was that like?
1765,It was unreal kind of unexplainable.
1765,"Oh okay, well what I find interesting is that ghosts are described so differently. Some people say they're an invisible presence but others say they're translucent and wispy."
1765,It happened so quickly I but i still believe.
1765,I can understand that. Where did it happen?
1765,I know it sounds cliche but once in the basement and another time in the attic.
1765,that's pretty wild . are you religious ?
1766,"Really thats so cool, I love taylor swift shes my idol"
1766,She just did a concert here in the big city. I missed it though.
1766,"I wanted to go too, but I was at work as a beer distributor "
1766,"I see, how bad. I had to miss, for a family outing. What beer do you distribute?"
1766,"budlight, its a cool factory, what do you like about taylor"
1766,"I hope beer is like the factory then, since I've never tried that brand. I would say that I love how he expresses his emotions in such a right way."
1766,"Same my favorite songs by her are the old country ones, like back to December "
1766,I do actually quite a few mainly old country songs like daddys hands is a big one super oldie! 
1766,"yes lol, and you belong with me is kind of pop but still good ol country "
1766,well what would you consider her music ? and you are right
1766," I think you cant put artists in a genre of music anymore, they continue to grow and develop into different people "
1766,"That may be true, there are so many different styles and all music is different"
1767,I do work. And taking the bus does not seem fun. How is it?
1767,Actually it's way too quiet and boring.
1767,I can see that. What do you do for work?
1767,I work in a library.
1767,I love the library! Nothing like going in and seeing and feeling actual books
1767,"Yes, reading a book is one of the things I enjoy most in life. "
1767,I enjoy fantasy fiction. you?
1767,"Yes, I love fantasy. What is your favorite fantasy book?"
1768,Did you become vegan because you love animals? I did.
1768,"Yea I love animals with all my heart, so I decided to stop eating them."
1768,That's really cool. What's your favourite animal?
1768,I absolutely love dogs
1768,Oh reall? I have a dog at home named Robbie. Do you have any pets?
1768,Yeah I have one my dog is named Apollo.
1768,Cool. What kind of dog is Apollo?
1768,Hes a shitzu what type of dog is yours
1768,He's a border collie. I also have a cat named Buttons.
1768,that is awesome and cute . well i have to go was nice meeting you
1768,Nice meeting you too!
1768,It was nice talking to you!
1769,But I want to still be me. I just want the money. 
1769,Oh definitely. I enjoy myself too much to try to be anyone else.
1769,That's awesome! I would love to just have the money. The way this economy is is not right. 
1769,I agree. It's unfair that the rich have just about everything while most people are struggling.

1781,"Oh that sounds amazing, the next cup will wake you up. Do you have any ideas on a new book title I should write?"
1781,What genre?
1781,I was thinking a Fiction maybe a sci-fi since all of the new generations are into tech and all!
1781,Science fiction is hard to write. You have to know enough science to get the fiction part right. It bet it would be fun tho.
1782,"It's been 10 years now, but it feels like even longer. In a good way."
1782,That's great! I have been married for seven years and we have two kids.

1784,I'm actually a vegetarian for the most part. I only eat meat once in a while. 
1784,oh! that's fine.
1784,I wouldn't mind a burger right now though. 
1785,"No, she never learned. I have recommended she join a local YMCA to take swimming classes. "

1785,"No, it is one of those standard orange ones with the black straps. Do you know how to swim?"
1785,"Yes I do, my parents taught me when I was young so that I could hold my breath and swim a bit"
1785,That's awesome! I learned as a child too. I took classes at the boys and girls club in my hometown.
1786,I'm getting a music industry degree. What do you do?
1786,Nothing in music! I have no musical talent at all. Only person I know who was told to quit piano lessons!
1786,LOL! You should have taken up the tuba for spite.
1786,"I envy you. I grew up in Nashville, Music City. How did you get into music?"
1786,I had a musical family. Everybody played an instrument so it just came naturally. What's Nashville like?
1786,It's way too big now. It's lost a lot of it's charm. Where are you from?
1786,"Alabama believe it or not, but I haven't been there in a while. I like it up north."
1786,"I love Alabama. It still has that slow, southern feel to it."
1786,No doubt. I think people are slow there because of that awful heat. Hottest place next to Texas I've ever been.
1786,That's about right! I have family in Houston. It's miserable!
1786,You won't catch me denying climate change! I don't like big cities either. It's too hard to live there.
1786,I moved to a small town in Florida. I like the slow pace. I kind of miss the seasons though.
1787,How long have you been together?
1787,Im proposing tonight
1787,Do you have it all planned out?  Where and how?
1787,"yes, Im gonna go to her moms house and wait for her to come there"

1787,"oh cool, youre married is it hard sometimes"
1787,It is... never thought I'd have to get a family car like a honda Civic!
1787,cool car easy to maintain?
1787,It is. And good gas milege
1787,good
1788,"I'm not a big fan of rap, I prefer rock music."
1788,"I know what you mean, I'm a big fan of Drake but I also enjoy some rock bands. Which bands your favorite?"
1788,I'm a big fan of Led Zeppelin. What about you?
1788,"I enjoy all sorts, ACDC, Guns n Roses, Imagine Dragons. "
1788,I like older bands mainly. But I like Believer by Imagine Dragons.
1788,I went out to eat last night to a pretty fancy restraunt and they had Believer playing. Imagine Dragons has something for everyone.
1788,"I love food, what did you have?"
1788,"It was an indian restraunt, had some sort of spicy lamb, was my first time going. It was terrific."
1788,"That sounds really good, do you like Indian food?"
1788,"Yes surprisingly, didn't think I would! Where do you like to eat at?"
1788,"I like all sorts of food, I'm a big fan of sushi but there's no sushi restaurants near me."
1788,"I've never had Sushi! I had squid though, tasted like a hotdog. Don't think I'll try it again."
1789,I'm so excited! I can barely contain my excitement.
1789,That's awesome! What laptop are you getting?
1789,I'll probably get a new macbook.
1789,I've never had any apple products. Do you like them?
1789,"There not too bad, I have a iphone and a ipad."
1789,I've been thinking of getting an Iphone. Do you have the newest one?
1789,Yes I have the newest iphone. I like it alot.
1789,"I've always had Samsung Galaxies, but I've only ever heard good things about iPhones. Maybe i'll make the switch this year!"
1789,Probably your year to switch phones.
1789,I think so! Thanks for the help!
1789,I got this new laptop for school. I'm actually on the baseball team. This is my second year.
1789,That's so cool! Do you play any other sports?
1790,"I saw one when I was 8, but haven't seen one since. I'd like to get the chance again."
1790,Awesome! Was it a total eclipse when the disc of the sun was completely covered by the moon?
1790,"It was just a partial eclipse I think, but still very exciting."
1790,Oh cool. What kind of things do you like to do for fun?
1790,I really just like going for walks. Sometimes just walk in the woods or around town and look at things.
1790,That sounds like great exercise. 
1790,"It definitely is, it's a workout sometimes. I live on a hill."
1790,I try to exercise as much as possible but I work long hours at my job. 
1790,"That's tough, for sure. What do you do for work?"
1790,I work in finance with investments. 
1790,That sounds like a difficult job.
1790,It's definitely complicated but I actually like it a lot. What do you do for work?
1791,For sure.  I actually don't have a dog though.  I have two snakes.  They're awesome.
1791,How do you have them?  in an enclosure?
1791,"Yes, they're in glass cages, but I take them out and handle them all the time.  They're friendly!"
1791,what species?
1791,They're both pythons.  They eat rats I breed.  We're an all-organic family.
1791,Cool!  I imagine the rats get the food waste from your kitchen
1791,"Yes, rats will each just about anything.  Unfortunately for them some things eat rats, too."
1791,Yeah thats the way it is low rat on the totem pole of life
1791,Indeed!  So tell me about your hobbies or interests.
1791,I ride a bike and read.  Joe boring is my name
1791,"That's not so boring!  I love reading and riding my bike as well.  Too cold for biking right now, but perfect for reading!"
1791,Not cold where I am at but I have an elliptical for that time.  I have a lot of books so its ok in winter

1792,I say Tom Brady again no one can come close
1792,I totally agree with you. He's great! Hopefully he can get another ring this year
1793,I used to eat dry watercolors back in Kindergarten.
1793,Wow. What color was your feces? I only ate the paste. 
1793,"Usually blue. That was my favorite ""flavor""."
1793,HA! Who can judge art? That's awesome!
1793,Did you have a preferred brand of paste?
1793,It was the little white bottle that the teacher would leave in the middle of the table. She had a spoon in it. 
1793,I was known to eat a dab of Elmers every now and then. Also ate reams and reams of paper.
1793,Oh my! My grandfather worked at a paper mill. They would pour feces from sewage into the mix to create the paper!
1793,"That sewage is what ""brings all the boys to the yard"", as they say..."
1793,HAHA! Hell no. I couldn't think about eating it once I was told that. I never found out if he was lying or not either. 
1793,"I cant image that it was true. 85% of kids in school will eat at least one sheet of paper this week. They cant contaminate it, can they?"
1793,With today's filters I actually believe they do use recycled sewage to create paper. I do know that it's just a large sludge mess they dry.
1794,Yep! I start every morning with a cup of french vanilla. Do you like coffee?
1794,"Yeah, I like coffee too. I am drinking some right now. "
1794,Oh cool! what kind?
1795,"Yes, it's great, do you buy with coupons?"
1795,"I do buy with coupons, but I don't buy just because I have coupons"
1795,It's fun to save a little with coupons
1795,I agree.   I have a great coupon for a sale at the mall
1795,Great! Barba de tres dias?
1795,"No, I'm going to Kohls.    They have 50% off shoes"
1795,"Fantastic, but what brands of shoes?"
1795,I prefer Adidas.    I hope that when I go in the sales people leave me alone though
1795,"Hehehe, I like adidas shoes too"
1795,"Adidas has so many different styles, that I can generally wear them with anything"
1795,"You are right, it is a brand that has a lot to give with respect to shoes, it has a lot of variety"
1795,I wear them because I'm sure that I look great in them when I go hiking!
1796,I wish I can do it but maybe I have to try another sport. 
1796,You should definitely try. You'll get addicted!
1796,I know I won't do surfing because I hate the beach.
1796,why is it the sand lol
1796,The sand and it is either too hot or too cold at the beach. What sport do you like?
1796,"volley ball, but everytime I meet someone they ask if i play basketball because im 6 4 it gets annoying"
1796,Oh I wish I am as tall as you. I think being tall is better than short.
1796,"honestly they both have ups n downs, taller people can die sooner and have more back problems in the future"
1796,Oh really? I hope you won't have those issues and stay healthy.
1796,"ye same here, im vegan so I dont really have to worry that much about health, but staying fit is hard im not really that knowlegable on exercise yet"
1796,Keep doing the volleyball. I think the best exercise is the one you enjoy.
1796,"yes true, I only play every once in a while, ill need to find something else too"
1797,"How did you realize that you were having mental health issues? I feel stressed and ""off"" sometimes but I don't know if everyone just feels that way"
1797,I couldn't focus and felt anxious much of the time.
1797,Doesn't everyone feel that way though?
1797,Not as far as I know. I felt very much alone in these feelings and found it difficult to talk about.
1797,What finally made you decide to talk about it?
1797,"There seemed to be less of a stigma around mental health, people were encouraging discussions about mental health publicly."
1797, I think I need to build up the confidence to just do it.Who did you tell?
1797,"I tend to tell my best friend everything, so I started with her. Her acceptance and support led me to have the confidence to talk to my family and professionals."
1797,"I have a basketball coach, do you think that would be a good choice?"
1797,Absolutely! Coaches care about the mental state of their players.
1797,Maybe I will try that 
1797,"I encourage you to, and I wish you the best of luck."
1798,I have a little girl named Lucy.
1798,what do you like to eat for dessert usually?
1798,I'm a big fan of all kinds of pies. Pumpkin is my favorite.
1798,i just love cheese cake! 
1798,Oh me too. I actually wrote a story about cheese cake once.
1798,oh thats awesome!  i drive 300 miles not everyday but for a week.
1798,I used to do that when I worked as a photographer. Now I work from home as a writer. 
1798,It is stressful but having a cheese cake after that is just a relief!
1798,Oh definitely. Food is a great reward.
1798,yeh! it was nice to chat with you
1798,"It was, I liked talking about cake."
1798,haha i just love cakes specially cheese cake!
1799,Maybe. I will have to see if they are worth any money. 
1799,"Yep, you could get rich! I would do it, as I currently don't have a job."
1799,That's too bad. I was unemployed recently and it was very hard. 
1799,"Yeah, I just sit around on the coach all day and i'm getting fat."
1799,Do you have any hobbies?
1799,"Not really. I am trying to eat in a healthy manner and not eat too much, so I'm sort of into nutrition now."
1799,That's good. It's good to look after your health. 
1799,"Yeah, I might even start a garden soon. How about you?"
1799,I enjoy horseback riding. It's fun and it gets me outdoors. 
1799,"i used to ride horses , but i have not in a while !"
1799,I also own several vintage cars that I like to fix up in my spare time. 
1799,"MY real car is so old, I think it IS vintage-lol!"
1800,"I don't know it just appeared, and it seemed poisonous"
1800,"it was running around the mall , i thought it was a huge rat ."
1800,Do you know that there is an island that is infected with snakes?
1801,"A little, I never eat much during the day as I eat a big meal of eggs and bacon for breakfast. WHat do you like?"
1801,I love Italian food. I am on sabbatical so this gives me time to explore a variety of dishes.
1801,"What is yout favourite italian dish? I go out weekends with friends and we each choose a place to eat at, you could suggest an italian dish?"
1801,I love chicken tetrazzini. I think it is the combo of mushrooms and chicken I love. You?
1801,"Traditional Lasagne is great but it has to be a very good one. The one you mention sounds great, I like chicken and mushrooms as well"
1801,Restaurant food is great but cooking at home is better. Do you cook often?
1801,"No, its only me at home so it feels more trouble than it is worth. DO you cook for your family?"
1801,"I do a big meal on Sundays, especially on summer vacation. We love to swim and then reheat a meal I made the day before."
1801,Sounds idylic! I can't rmemeber the last time I had a big Sunday dinner.
1801,You should try it. There is nothing wrong cooking just for yourself every once in a while.
1801,True. I might just go for it this weekend and plate up the spare and freeze it. More economical probably as well.
1801,True. It saves a lot of money. Especially when you make the more advanced dishes at home.
1802,"How expensive is the delivery though. It's great convenience, but I would hate to pay that much. "
1802,"Well, sometimes their fee is pretty affordable and it is great service. Do you rather go out?"
1802,"Yeah, I prefer going out and eating and maybe spending time with friends while I eat. Although that's definitely expensive too!"
1802,"Oh for sure, I would like to go out more but I am pretty overweight and I do not think I can change that soon..."
1802,"Yeah, that can be tough. Although ordering in from Uber probably can't help too much either :/ "
1802," I know, it is mainly my fault. I drink too much soda and eat a lot of junkie food..."
1802,"Yeah, it can be really hard not to do. I eat out way too much. "
1802,"It is the cheapest choice, going healthy is way too expensive."
1802,"Yeah, anytime I try to buy from the healthfood section at the store, I blow through my budget so quickly. "
1802,"Yeah, there should be ways to make healthy more affordable or a program to help people try to initiate a fit plan"
1802,I completely agree. It would be nice if fast food places had a cheap healthy option on their menus in addition to the trash. 
1802,"Well, for the moment we only can wait for something like that or try to suggest it. That can't hurt."
1803,"I work at the museum,its a great place to work you know?"
1803,I think that would be fun. Were you an art major?
1803,"No, but art is a big part of life, i cherish it so much, it's like i'm stuck in a wheelchair with it."
1803,That's an interesting perspective. What type of art do you like?
1803,"You know when something gets you speechless always, you are always in awe of all it's part,that's art for me"
1803,"So you see art in every day things. Like, when you look at a sunset over a mountain, you see that as art?"
1803,Is that not beautiful? God is master of art and that's just a fraction of what he does
1803,"I agree. If you really look, you can see art everywhere. Have you ever tried painting or sculpting?"
1803,"Yeah, sometimes, a little secret, don't tell anyone, i'm a horrible at it"
1803,Maybe you just need more practice. As long as you're having fun at it.
1803,"Yeah, and you should try them too. It's fun"
1803,"Maybe I will. My husband likes to paint, but I've never tried."
1803,You should try too 
1804,i like dairy products very much and very healthy too.
1804,"Yes, but I will say soy and almond milks are pretty good.  Just different."
1804,"okay, which dairy product you like?"
1804,I like Almond Milk as a brand.  But Private Selection is a good one too
1804,"i like milk halwa my favorite dish, did you know about that? "
1804,I don't!  What is that?
1804,"it is very delicious dish from india, if possible means order from online and taste it then it will be your favorite one."
1804,I'll have to try it sometime.  Hope it's not too expensive.  Not a lot of extra money at the moment. One day I'll be a millionaire!
1804,"yeah its very low around ten dolor only, and try milk-gova too , really very delicious one."
1804,I'll look into that!  Thanks for the ideas!
1804,yeah actually you belongs to which country?
1804,"I""m from USA - Texas specifically."
1804,oh okay nice to chat with you and try my suggestion .
1805,Working there has been great
1805,Having the ability to be able to treat peoples diseases and injury's is a blessing.
1805,that's how you find meaning in your life
1805,"Yes, you can say that. With rising inequality in american society, I want to help people from all walks of life."
1805,"It is important to help, but it is also important for people to work hard for themselves."
1805,"That's true. I made myself what I am today through hard work and dedication! It would be nice to see my family more, though."
1805,"It is always important to balance life, thinking about work in oneself and family"
1805,True. Do you see your sister much? I mostly see mine when I host holiday dinners at my home.
1805,"Unfortunately my family does not live in this country so I do not see them, I only speak with them by video conference"
1805,"That sounds difficult! I hope you can see them again soon. Technology has really helped to bring people together, hasn't it?"
1805,"Yes, definitely"
1805,"I have a brother on the other side of the country, and we use video chat often as well. It's hard, though, with the long hours at the hospital."
1805,It was nice to meet you
1806,Reading is fun but I spend most of my time working out. I gotta keep up with the game.
1806,I get that! Have you played basketball your whole life?
1806,Since High school. It just comes naturally to me.
1806,I bet it does. What position do you play?
1806,Center. Have you ever played?
1806,Very cool! I have played but I'm not any good! I'm more of a hockey guy.
1806,I've gone to a few games when I was in high school. I've seen the boston bruins live twice.
1806,Awesome! Did you grow up in Boston?
1806,Close to. About 50 minutes away. 
1806,"Nice, I'm from the D.C. area so I always see the Capitals play!"
1806,Very nice. DC is too crowded for me though. 
1806,"It is a lot, but i like the hussle bussle of it all! Keeps you on your toes."
1806,understood. 
1807,I am a bit concerned about leaving my painting business for that amount of time though...
1807,Maybe you should hire someone to take care of it.
1807,You just cant find anyone reliable these days though
1807,Whats wrong with leaving your painting business?
1807,"I dont want to miss out on the income while I'm away.  Oh well, It will be worth it to get away from my kids lol"
1807,"Do you paint, or do you just sell them?"
1807,"I'm actively a painter, what is your profession?"
1807,I'm an actuary for an insurance company.
1807,Oh brutal.  Must have been pretty awesome at math as a youth then
1807,"Yes, I finished Calc 2 before leaving high school. Do you enjoy painting or have any hobbies?"
1807,"I mostly do submission grappling on lunch breaks, and other than that I just hang around with my kids.  And you?"
1807, During lunch breaks? I play competitive video games like COD and Gran Turismo. I love racing. I also enjoy watching old movies and tv shows like Knight Rider.
1808,"Well, they were really slow"
1808,Perhaps they were just having a bad day?
1808,I suppose so. But they also spelled my name wrong twice!
1808,Was your name something easy to misspell?
1808,Not really. It's a pretty common name.
1808,That's a shame. Maybe it was their first day on the job and they were nervous.
1808,That's a really good point. I should try to be more understanding.
1808,"It's a great characteristic to have. So, what else do you do with your life?"
1808,"I really love to go fishing, especially fly fishing. How about you?"
1808,"I'm a bit elderly, so I naturally picked up fishing myself. It's only tradition, haha."
1808,That is what's great about fishing. People of all ages can enjoy it.
1808,"Yeah, that's one main thing about fishing that I love. The peace and quiet as you cast out your line trying to catch a fish is nice as well!"
1809,I didn't even try. I feel ok setting my own pace and beating my own goals.
1809,Do you ever run in organized races?
1809,"I haven't yet, but I'd like to try. How about you?"
1809,"No, mostly I just like to run out in the countryside where I live. "
1809,"That sounds nice. I live in the country too, with my cat."
1809,I love cats.
1809,Me too. Mine is named Seven of Nine.
1809,That's cool. What else do you like to do for fun?
1809,I like to go to Broadway shows. I love singing show tunes!
1809,Do you go to see shows often?
1809,"Only once or twice a year, but the songs get stuck in my head constantly."
1809,I like to visit the city sometimes. Maybe I should go see a show next time I'm there. 
1810,I have some sketchy neighbors that I don't like walking past. 
1810,Well there are some good safety apps for your phone that a friend can monitor you as you walk home. Maybe you want to try one of those.
1810,That's a good idea! 
1810,pretty cleaver technology. that way you'll have the comfort of a friend in sketchy times and security to know they can call for help 
1810,Yes that's true. I've seen where it alerts your contact if you drop your phone which is good when you can't react quick enough
1810,right! i personally carry bear mace
1810,Yeah that's not a bad idea. I would carry if I could right now. there's just too many unknowns.
1810,unknowns?
1810,Just too many people with bad intentions i mean!
1810,"oh right, I am terrified about human trafficking. I never go anywhere by myself at night."
1810,I really thought that whole thing was a myth a few years ago but it's really becoming so apparent now. Especially with kids.
1810,you can never be too careful theses days. staying safe and being alret is a must. but still need to enjoy life.
1811,Have you ever heard of steelers?
1811,I have heard of them but I don't keep up with football. 
1811,"I am a huge fan of them, you should give football a try."
1811,I like college football better. Have you heard of the Georgia Bulldogs?
1811,"I have, they just won their final recently , right?"
1811,Yeah I think they beat South Carolina but I can't remember. Have you ever been to a college football game? 
1811,"no i have not, i just became a football fan. I missed much. I enjoy rock music more than sport"
1811,I love going to live shows. What bands do you like?
1811,"my favorite would be avett brother, you know them?"
1811,Yeah I have listened to them before. Do you like Fleet Foxes?
1811,yes ofcourse!  tiger mountain song is one of my fav song of all time 
1811,That is a great song. Their albums sound really good through a pair of high-quality headphones.
1811,"I will definitely listen to it with high qulaity headphones. You should also attend the avett brother concert, they are on tour this week in the south coast. "
1812,I wonder why they did that?  Do they play in Winter?  That's my favorite season
1812,I'm not sure about that by I can tell you that the sport has been around since1968 and was developed by high school students
1812,Wow! What sport is this?
1812,Rugby. It's from England
1812,That's somewhat similar to football (American) right?
1812,yeah basically! The rules were modified so much that it just became different forms of rugby
1812,That's interesting.  Do you play?
1812,"oh no , i'm horrible at it . i prefer to watch rather than play"
1812,I'd love to go watch a game sometime.  I've never seen it
1812,You should go watch it live. It is much better live.
1812,Do they have games played in America?
1812,No I do not belive so. They have Football here.
1813,Sure. Mac and cheese makes a great addition! Is that what you like?
1813,yes. enchiladas for the win!
1813,Absolutely! Its great to have a nice meal and then settle down with a book for the evening.
1813,"Of course, what kind of books do you like?"
1813,My favorites tend to be thrillers. I'm reading Ancestor by Scott Sigler right now - for the 3rd time lol
1813,I love thrillers. I watched Killing Eve.
1813,What's that about?
1813,It's about a lady who is in the afterlife by mistake and realized all the good of her righteous life.
1813,Oooo that sounds very interesting! Have you seen American Horror Story?
1813,Yes! it's one of my favorite series
1813,Excellent! It amazes me how I always feel so bad for the most horrible people.
1813,I recently saw the remake of 
1814,When are you going?
1814,2 weeks from now. I wish it was sooner.
1814,I'm sure you are just counting down the minutes! How long are you staying?
1814,We are staying for 2 weeks. We want to make sure we get the full experience.
1814,"That will be amazing! I am actually from Tokyo, and just moved to L.A."
1814,Oh nice! LA is like a vacation in itself. 
1814,It still feels like that! It tough to focus when everything is so different
1814,Where did you move from?
1814,I lived in downtown Tokyo before this!
1814,That is a big difference for sure then! Culture shock for you.
1814,Yeah but I had spent extended time in the U.S. before. Still very different though!
1814,My daughters really want to travel to Japan so hopefully they get the chance to when they are a little older.
1815,That's so cool. How did you get into football? I am obsessed but my girlfriend doesn't get it.
1815,"nice , i am not a big fan but go because my girlfriend love it"
1815,So we need to swap places.( Just kidding). I love her anyway. How often do you two go?
1815,every few years.. and its enough!
1815,Yeah I suppose that is enough if you really don't like it. So what do you like to do?
1816,that is basic thing even as a human we have to things about that.
1816,"Well, as a psychologist I would strongly suggest to talk it out"
1816,"yeah correct, next we have to put a board as ""Do not park infront of gate"""
1816,"That should work out too, unless that person is just doing to mess with you."
1816,is this happens before to you?
1816,Not usually; this is an unusual case!
1816,"oh , okay. did u park like this before?"
1816,"No, I have never done it... "
1816,okay my advise is please don't do like that and please advice to other don't do like this.
1816,I think you should just continue talking over your neighbor. Maybe that will get your neighbor to stop.
1816,yeak okay.
1816,i find that the best approach is sitting down and telling them calmly .
1816,"okay, that nice!!! i will do that."
1817,Interesting. I would love to take some classes. 
1817,Do you dance at all?
1817,I don't but I think it would be a really great workout. 
1817,Absolutely! It would be a lot more fun than running haha.
1817,Oh yeah. Not a fan. I hardly have any time for that these days playing in my band. 
1817,Do you play an instrument or sing?
1818,My lizard is named Gila. I have lots of houseplants that he likes to chill on. Do you have any pets? 
1818,"Yes, I have 23 cats! They're the best, aren't they?"
1818,"I prefer lizards personally, but it's good that you've given so many cats a home. It must be a challenge keeping the litterboxes clean! "
1818,"They're actually potty trained! I'm not cleaning that up, ha ha. I wouldn't mind a lizard, but the cats would likely eat it!"
1818,"They probably would! Other than cat care, what do you do in your free time? "
1818,"Mainly Youtube, I do some freelance work on it occasionally, and Reddit. Lots of Reddit. You?"
1818,"Ha, yes. Lots of Reddit here too. I like aww and whatisthisbug best. "
1818,That sounds cool. I watch lots of cat videos myself.
1818,"I watch many lizard videos. Fewer antics than cats, but just as cute in their own way. "
1818,I could see that. Some lizards even walk on a leash!
1818,"Yes! About as well as cats do. I'm also super into plants, mostly succulents and orchids. Do cats try to eat houseplants? "
1818,Yes! All the time. I don't have many because of that.
1819,"i have brothers and i'm the best cook of all, i can cook 5 different cuisines though i'm the amateur"
1819,WOW! What is your favorite thing to cook?
1819,"i'm a scientist too, i don'ht like broccoli"
1819,LOL- I love all vegetables. I run a cat foster house.
1820,Yes I will call and asked for assistant from my local Pet Shop.  It is very difficult for me to get out because I have two elderly parents.
1820,Calling the pet shop is a good idea. I bet they will have helpful advice for you.
1820,"I am sure they will.  My parents get very upset when they hear all of this noise.  Of course, I have to keep  peace."
1820,Keeping your parents happy is important. Maybe your dogs need more exercise.
1820,I asked my brothers that very question.
1820,It might help if you take them to a dog park and tire them out.
1820,I will asked my brothers  for assistant.  This might work.
1820,That's a really good idea. I sure hope you can find something that works for all of you.
1820,Yes it is necessary.
1820,I will keep my fingers crossed that everything works out for you. Take care and good luck!
1820,Thank you for the chat.  It gave me hope.
1820,You're welcome! I'm happy to help!
1821,"Great, my occupation allows me to travel all over the world!"
1821,"I've travelled to many countries too, but just as a tourist!"
1821,"Being a tourist is the best part, trying new foods and seeing new places!"
1821,"I love to backpack and stay at hostels, meeting other travelers."
1821,"Yes, backpacking through the woods and different parks brings me great joy. I love meeting new people and listening to their stories. "
1821,"My favorite places were China, Cambodia, Italy and France."
1821,All of the places you mentioned have excellent food choices and the shopping is amazing.
1821,I hope to travel some more in the future. Need to earn a few bucks first!
1821,"Me too... I need as much money as I can get right now. Perhaps, I'll get a new job!"
1821,"If you have a job that already allows you to travel, that's worth a lot."
1821,"Yes, but I rather travel without having to add work into it. I want to be free!"
1821,Good point. I hope you can visit Mexico in the future. We have some fine cultural events.
1822,"Well I'm already in a relationship, so I shouldn't be asking that!"
1822,Just because you are on a diet doesn't mean you can't look at the menu!
1822,Trust! I don't think she would be too happy with me window shopping though!
1822,"Probably not, but at the same time, I would assume that everyone window shops"
1822,"Fair point! Good for my buddy though, it just blows my mind how he landed her"
1822,Maybe she had gotten hurt by guys in her league and decided that she would try something different
1822,You may be right. He is a nice dude so good move by her
1822,"Hopefully it works out for both.   He treats her right, and she makes him happy!"
1822,That's a very nice thing to say! I hope so too. Maybe I can set you up with one of his friends!
1822,"I'm a single mother, and really don't have time to date, but I enjoy hearing the stories!"
1822,I understand that! Who doesn't love a little drama they don't have to deal with
1822,"Right!   I enjoy that the drama in my life, has nothing to do with me!   Get the popcorn ready!"
1823,"Maybe, but at least we like the same dessert: cheesecake. Yum. "
1823,i love to take cheescake my favorite everyday
1823,"Cheesecake is my favorite, too! My maids serve it to me every Sunday. "
1823,cheesecake is my favorite ! cheesecake foredays
1823,"Y...yeah. Anyway, I'm getting a bit tired of the maids I've hired. I'm thinking of hiring new ones. Have you ever had maids?"
1823,"Yes. I once worked with a girl who did nothing while I polished silverware, restocked work stations and the like. She was awful!"
1823,"Sounds bad! My maids do a good job, but I am a big jerk of a man who only cares for eye candy."
1823,Lol eye candy is good to speaking of have you ever saw that show on MTV called Eye Candy it's a thriller series.
1823,"No, I have never seen it. I don't really watch TV I mostly watch my maids as they work. I need therapy."
1823,Maybe you should watch some Netflix.
1823,Good idea!!! Thanks for the advice. I will try out Netflix. I feel our conversation can come to an end now as I need to find maids. 
1823,"netflix ? man , good luck dealing with that . my wife and i could not get it working ."
1823,Oh! You had problems with the Netflix?
1824,I can relate to that. There is not much to do here either. Especially since it's gotten cold.
1824,"I love the cold only when I get to stay inside though, I like to play my Nintendo switch"
1824,Nice! My husband and I play the switch all the time actually. But we also like playing outside with my daughter. she loves bugs 
1824,"nice, I like playing with my pet huskey outside when it gets a little warmer in the day"
1824,Dogs are the best really but we may have to rehome our dog soon unfortunately.
1824,why
1824,We are starting to travel a lot and feel like he needs more attention. My sister has graciously said she wanted him so it works out.
1824,oh nice I want to travel some day too
1824,We travel quite a bit but bought an RV to travel even more now. 
1824,omg thats so cool. what games do you play on switch
1824,"We play Zelda, Skyrim, and Mario usually"
1824,"nice, do you have nintendo online if you do you can play old school games like snes"
1825,"I ordered a turkey burger but when I bit into it, the meat was still raw"
1825,That's awful! Raw turkey can make you sick and I hope it didn't.
1825,They gave me a new burger but they were rude about it
1825,Restaurants do hate to be wrong. I wouldn't go back if I were you.
1825,"Yes, we won't. My son didn't like the food either. "
1825,"I see, terrible all around. I have been reading up lately on places to visit and food to try. Italian keeps popping up!"
1825,I like Italian food. What is your favorite type of food?
1825,"I'd have to say Italian, with Japanese being a very close second."
1825,Cool. I like Thai food. 
1825,I need to try that sometime. I keep reading up on it but never actually go out to eat it..
1825,You should definitely try it. I love all types of Asian food. 
1825,"Thanks for the recommendation. I'll give it a shot when I can! Also, outside of food do you have any hobbies?"
1826,it was I want to be a music teacher now
1826,Thats awesome!   My sisters and I started our own bakery!
1826,"omg thats so cool, I play violin thats why I want to"
1826,Oh I love Violin!!!   I wasn't ever good at music.   Thats why I bake!  
1826,"nice, Im vegan so i bake on occasion "
1826,Being Vegan is a noble thing!   Have you always been vegan?
1826,"no 3 years i was over weight and lost 70 pounds, also I do it for the environment now "
1826,"Oh wow!!!!   Thats so amazing!  Congratulations!   I eat some meat, but I stay away from beef mostly."
1826,"good, eating some meat is better than eating alot "
1826,"In my house we mostly eat meat from the ocean, and stay away from land, but it gets expensive!"
1826,"ye, being vegan is kind of cheap but only if you eat mostly whole foods."
1826,How do you get your protein ?
1827,I love Greek history and philosophy. It's fascinating. I'm taking college classes in both right now. What do you study? 
1827,History and philosophy:  they both encompass the body of knowledge.
1827,Very true! We have a lot in common. Do you like technology too? 
1827,"I do, I make commercials, so I'm self taught."
1827,That's great! I'm learning about laptop repair. Mine has a defective battery and it's brand new. :( 
1827,OH my! I use my laptop every day. I actually watch TV and movies on it. Can you replace the battery?
1827,Yes. I hope the warranty will cover a new one and I will install it. I watch Netflix on my laptop. What's your favorite show? 
1827,"Well, I really miss Downton Abbey, but I also like Orange is the New black. What about you?"
1827,I like The Office and Parks & Rec. I miss Downton Abbey too! Will you see the new film? 
1827,"Yes, but movie prices here are so high! I'll wait for dvd, i think."
1827,"I'm going to try to catch it at the cinema before my evening classes today. Movies are very affordable here, especially early in the day. "
1827,"Sounds good, what are you studying?"
1828,My neighbors are not the friendliest so I try to avoid them and they were outside.
1828,I am sorry your neighbors are not friendly. Have you thought about moving?
1828,Well they just moved in a few days ago but we are moving in the next 4 months luckily!
1828,That is good to hear. Where are you moving?
1828,Well we are going to start traveling. We have a golden retriever and 2 kids and want to travel everywhere.
1828,"That's awesome, I love dogs. Where are you going to travel?"
1828,Any where possible really. We live in an RV so we are traveling the US eventually.
1828,That is really cool. I am going to Jamaica in a couple months. 
1828,Yes it's great! The world is our backyard
1828,That is a good feeling to have. What is your favorite place to visit? 
1828,Colorado for sure. It's gorgeous. 
1828,The Colorado mountains are breathtaking. I want to go again soon. 
1829,Yes I agree. I love the outdoors. Do you like the outdoors as well?
1829,yes. I love the outdoors. We camp often in the summer and I also enjoy trail running and hiking. 
1829,Oh that sounds fun! I like camping. Another way to help save the environment is buying second hand things. Any interest in that?
1829,I actually purchase 90% of mine and my children's closed second hand! It's a great way to save money and save the earth
1829,Exactly. Glad we agree. Goodwill has been my favorite store for shopping. I like salvation army too.
1829,You should! Alot of the profits from thrift stores go to good causes too!
1829,Yes they do and you are helping the earth so it couldnt be better than that!
1829,I agree. I also try to purchase food that is not prepackaged so that i use less packaging. 
1829,thats great! and use a reusable bag? 
1829,That is the way we do it also. The newer reusable shopping bags are really nice for the items we need on out picnics.
1829,yes and some of them can even be used for coolers. The things they invent!
1829,I also enjoy growing my own food in the summer. I grow all kinds of things. 
1829,Nice. I love fresh produce. Maybe one day I can grab some from you. Well it is was nice chatting. Have a good day!
1829,thank you ! enjoy the rest of your day too !

1830,retail therapy helps me zen from reality maybe you should try
1830,"thanks, do you like ariana grande"
1830,"Not really, I prefer books to music."
1830,do you listen to any music
1830,"Yeah, some rock. You?"
1830,all kind. have you heard of pvris or fly leaf or paramore
1830,"Yes, Fly Leaf and Paramore. Did you go to college?"
1830,im in college now
1830,Cool! What are you studying?
1830,honestly im just taking core classes now before I transfer because I still dont know what I want to
1830,Do you enjoy it? I didn't at first but loved it by the end.
1830,"well for me I dont need to enjoy it right now, Im doing the boring classes first then i take the fun classes later"
1831,"Yes, I know that is exactly what will happen! But I'm worried about causing a fight"
1831,"Open communication is always best. Took my wife forever to convince me of that, but she's right."
1831,"Yes, you are right. i guess I am also still grieving for my cat that passed away, and it will feel strange to have another cat"
1831,"Aww, I'm sorry to hear that! Maybe you'd bond with the little guy, though."
1831,that's true. do you have any pets?
1831,The kids got a puppy for Christmas.
1831,Oh! How is taking care of a dog? I would love one but am worried about all the walks etc
1831,"I don't know, my wife usually does it."
1831,sounds like you have a great family then!
1831,"We do. I work long hours, so I don't see them much, but we try."
1831,"oh that's tough. my roomate is the same, but i prefer it that way to be honest."
1831,That makes sense. Gives you a chance for some peace and quiet.
1832,"Well, I do have a twin brother that frustrates sometimes."
1832,Oh no!   What does he do that upsets you?
1832,"He's an amazing piano player, but he doesn't apply himself to his craft."
1832,So basically he is wasting his talent.   Whats his reasoning for not applying himself?
1832,"To be fair, I think maybe he still doesn't know what he wants to do with his life."
1832,"I get that!   I used to get in a ton of trouble, but then I realized how much I love reading, and just read about others trouble instead"
1832,I really admire that. What's your favorite book? Mine is David Copperfield.
1832,"I love to read more political stories, history, and basically anything non fiction"
1832,I usually stick to fiction. Charles Dickens is one of my favorite authors. 
1832,"Everyone has to like Charles Dickens, he is the Walt Disney of books!"
1832,Very true! I think everyone has grown up watching the movie version of A Christmas Carol.
1832,Yes!   I watch it every season!   I also watch a ton of Disney movies.   Its my little secret haha
1833,"of course, go ahead!"
1833,I sing in the shower all the time but am so embarrassed to sing in public. I could never sing like that. Im sure you have a great voice. 
1833,"haha, aww! I also sing in the shower and use my body wash as a microphone. No shame in my game!"
1833,Haha that is too funny! I am a good painter though. I paint alot of nature pictures with trees
1833,oh i am jealous! I am a terrible artist! Do you have a favorite artist?
1833,I like them all. I feel they all have great talents in their own way. Do you have a favorite singer since your trying to be a famous one?
1833,i have so many!!! its so hard to pick a favorite. i loved the performance by Lady Gaga when i saw her live
1833,Wow. when did you see her live/
1833,"a few years ago, when she put out her first album. id love to see her again! Have you been to any concerts recently?"
1833,I went to a lil wayne concert lol. but that was a lonnnggg time ago. It was fun. I think I need to go to another concert soon though. 
1833,yeah i love concerts but i rarely go. i find it hard when tickets go on sale like a year in advance
1833,Yes the prices and sometimes the crowd can be very crazy.
1834,That's cool. I've heard of him but I don't listen to his music.
1834,i grew up watchim him
1834,What other musicians do you like?
1834,"That yo gotti stuff is just a joke, I'm into Black Metal first and foremost.  Satyricon, Gorgoroth, Mayhem, Burzum, etc.  What is your music of choice?"
1834,It depends on my mood but I have been listening to a lot of Tycho lately
1834,"Hmm, I've never heard of that.  What genre is that?"
1834,It's electronic but more down tempo and chill than EDM
1834,"Oh Ok, I listen to some stuff roughly in that genre: KMFDM, Thrill Kill Kult, Wumpscut"
1834,"I haven't heard of them, I'll have to look them up. Do you like Pink Floyd? "
1834,"Oh, I dont dislike them. I have fond memories of my dad listening to that when i was growing up though"
1834,"Me too, I still have his Dark Side of the Moon record and I have been listening it to a lot lately. Do you like psychedelic rock? "
1834,"oooft, not really.  The closest I get to that is stoner metal like Monster Magnet."
1835,Wow you know a lot about cars then.
1835,yes i do . my family is in the automotive business .
1835,Do sell cars then or what?
1835,the family business . lol. I prefer writing in my cabin.
1835,I meant is your automotive business involve selling cars?
1835,"Yes, that's what they do. I was supposed to take over, but I don't want to. I don't even drive a new car."
1835,Wow you do not drive. How do you get to where you want to go then?
1835,I have a 2011 Volkswagen Passa. Just not one of the new cars my family insists on.
1835,Do you like to drive your Passat?
1835,It's pretty nice. Does well on the ice up north.
1835,I live in Florida so no ice or snow here ever. Just hurricanes. 
1835,i have never been in a hurricane thankfully .
1836,"I understand you, but you know how to sing with all lungs is quite relaxing sometimes. Even if you sing very badly haha"
1836,"Yes, and I need to hide the fact that I am a poor vocalist behind very loud music, especially when I'm in my car, lol."
1836,"Well, the best scenario for people like us are singing in a group. It's a law, while more people are in a choir, we all sound better."
1836,You're totally correct. (:
1836,hahahaha you know it's also one of my favorite hobbies? play videogames.
1836,What kind of video games are you into?
1836,"Good throughout my life, I played several styles. But I certainly keep the shooter and RPG. I like fantasy and adventure."
1836,I like fantasy and adventure too. What's your favorite?
1836,The one I have enjoyed without a doubt has been the sagas of Zelda. Almost all are great.
1836,Those are great titles. I am a big Nintendo fan. I can't wait for the new Metroid Prime.
1836,"The same, although I am currently following Sony with the PS4. I never had the opportunity to play the metroid prime on GC"
1836,"Me neither, I heard it was good though."
1836,"It certainly was as I saw. Hey, I have to go, we'll talk later."
1837,"Yeah, there's a lot of good classes offered by resorts. Sometimes you can find a great resort deal by booking months in advance."
1837,not a bad idea ! i might have to do that ! Do you ever read books about skiing since you know so much?
1837,I have been skiing with members of my family since I was six years old. It's a great way to connect with them
1837,"That's awesome, I do too! I love the rich history behind it, there were Norwegian army units skiing for sport all the way back in the 18th century."
1837,Really? That's super interesting. I didn't think the army would be into that sort of thing. Are you into other sports?
1837,No I really dont like sports but love to read. I learn alot just from reading
1837,"Same. I'm an avid reader, but most of the stuff I read is fiction. "
1837,Do you have any favorite books?
1837,"Yes, my favorite books are usually in the fantasy genera. I enjoy things like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. How about you?"
1837,well my favorites were the harry potter series so we have that in common. Any pets?
1837,I have two dogs. Both of them are hyperactive puppies. They have so much energy.

1838,Thats awesome. A fellow writer! What have you written about?
1838,I love writing about politics.
1838,"I do like politics, especially in the coming age of E-democracy.All adult citizens will have the equal ability to participate in creation of laws."
1838,Yes that could be a good thing or bad as well. I can be forgetful and can imagine others as well that could miss voting. 
1838,I agree. More people should get involved to make a change.
1838,Yes It is needed more than ever today. We all need to come together 
1838,I agree. We need to start chaning this world for the better. It all starts with one step forward. 
1838,Yes and love for each other.
1838,Most certainly agree!
1839,"that sounds so much fun, i love singing and dancing hard especially at concerts"
1839,Me too. What kind of concerts do you attend?
1839,"Rock music is my favorite, just loud and keep me going, how about you?"
1840,It's great! Such a tearjerker.
1840,i do not think i've ever seen it . what is it about ?
1840,A family with an adopted sibling.
1840,is it a good show ? i have never seen it .
1840,Yes. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. What do you like to watch?
1840,I like romantic comedies a lot.
1840,"Cool, me too. I love sitting down with a plate of apples at the end of the day and just relaxing with my favorite shows."
1840,"What do you do in your spare time? I like to write poetry,"
1840,"Work out, mostly. I'm training for a marathon. Poetry is cool."
1840,That's pretty awesome. Do you usually run marathons?
1840,This will be my first one.
1840,"Best of luck! I could never do it, I commend you."
1841,My mom does some palm reading
1841,"That must be super interesting, I bet she has great insight."
1841,"She's always been an insightful person, but she lives all the way out in New Orleans so I don't see  her much"
1841,Oh that's too bad. I dont see my mom much either. Does it rain much in New Orleans?
1841,"It does tend to be pretty humid there. If you go visit New Orleans, be prepared to sweat!"
1841,"Im from England, I love the Rain, am used to it.  The humity I dislike tho."
1841,Oh wow! I've always wanted to visit England. Do you live near London?
1841,"No, Im from a small town in Warwickshire.  Its beautiful.  Im in Texas now tho."
1841,All the way from England to Texas? I bet you've led an interesting life!
1841,Not really!  Just have a family here now with a little one.  Otherwise i'd be back to the motherland :D
1841,I hope to have a little one of my own someday. Boy or a girl?
1841,I have a little girl.  Shes 16 months.  Its amazing. Shes so awesome. 
1842,I didn't know that either! What sort of work are you into?
1842,I do sales work! Not the best but pays the bills! What about you?
1842,I work in an office selling insurance! Not the best but pays the bills haha. What sort of stuff do you sale?
1842,"I mainly deal with general insurance like auto, home, etc. Occasionally I sell other types too!"
1842,What are the chances! Do you have any pets?
1842,I have 2 kids if that counts lol. Just kidding. Yes I have a dog. You?
1842,"I have a cat named Speckles! I don't think he's all there, but he is mine."
1842,LOL! I love it! What a cute name. I might use that in the future.
1842,"I've had him for six years now, he sometimes just screams in the middle of the night and goes right back to bed. He's crazy."
1842,Haha! That is so cute!
1842,What sort of music do you listen to?
1843,She was mad at something that happened within the family.
1843,Guess she's estranged for a reason.
1843,Very true! Have you ever had a family experience like that?
1843,"I personally have not, You must have though?"
1843,"Well yes, my dad's wife. We don't see them often!"
1844,Yes - his body couldn't tolerate all of the meat.
1844,I am sure you must have increased stomach growling after eating all of that. Why did you eat so much?
1844,I didn't eat it.  I saw another person do it.  I have no idea why they did it.
1844,Perhaps it was the type of fish food you were using?
1844,Who has a fish?  Do you have a fish?
1844,no i dont like fish unfortunately !
1844,I like sushi and baseball.  Do you like baseball?
1844,"I do like baseball, do you know how the game is scored?"
1844,Everytime a player crosses home plate a run is scored.  Each run is 1 point.
1844,"I understand, do you play baseball?"
1844,Yes - when I have the free time.
1844,"oh ok , so just like when ever you get the chance and do it ."
1844,what color is the sky?
1845,oh I'm sure you're not. Everyone has beauty and I know because I love taking pictures
1845,Are you a photographer?
1845,Just amateur right now but I want to be a famous photographer one day 
1845,"I love looking at Ansel Adams pictures. Do you like doing scenery type photos, or pictures of people?"
1845,Both but love scenery. Getting in nature is amazing there's so much to take pictures of
1845,"I agree. People think you can just click a bunch of pictures and something will turn out good, but gauging the light and the layout is an art."
1845,"Definitely, angles are important too"
1845,I remember looking at paintings by Monet. The same picture done with different light or from a different angle was always fascinating to me.
1845,"I love when the foreground, like trees, are black but there's a beautiful light or sunset behind"
1845,I like pictures taken in the rain. There's something about the light reflected on raindrops.
1845,Yes they are amazing. I haven't mastered that yet. I still have some pretty rain pictures though
1845,You're an artist. Artists never think they've mastered their art. It's continuing to grow that makes them good.
1846,What kind of work is it?
1846,"it is phone support, so not fun at all"
1846,Are you a telemarketer?
1846,"No, thankfully not. Do you live in the city or country?"

1846,Love it as there are many activities and beaches within a couple miles.
1846,I love the beach. I haven't been in a long time.
1846,Where are you living now?
1846,A big city in the Midwest.
1846,"I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. What city do you live in?"
1846,Michigan
1847,I just want everything to go right. You know how it is
1847,Yes for sure. My life is passion for making the best designer french fries.  I want them to be the best.
1847,Yum. That sounds delicious. How would you make them?
1847,"I love baking them and then frying them for 1 min, It is almost the perfect fry. Do you like music?"
1847,Thats great. Yes I love music. What about you?

1848,Yorkies are adorable. I love a tiny dog. What's their name?
1848,Fred. Do you have a dog?
1848,"I do. I have a couple, Scott and Harold. They're both tiny and goofy."
1848,"Aww, that's great! I hope to get another one soon. I didn't have enough space in my last apartment for a dog."
1848,I'm glad you have one now. What made you move to LA?
1848,Military. We were stationed in Tokyo for a year.
1848,That sounds interesting. Did you enjoy Tokyo?
1848,Too many people for me! I prefer the beach here in LA.
1848,I can understand that. Do you ever scuba dive?
1849,No it was good news. Turns out the lump wasnt cancerous. Thank goodness. 
1849,That's must be such a weight off you mind.  So glad you got good results.
1849,Yes it was tough. Thanks for being a great friend about it. Do you even volunteer?
1849,"Yes, I do at a charity shop.  Its awesome, Ive scored some great designer trendy stuff as a bonus."
1849,Oh nice. I can imagine you did. I do volunteers work for human rights places when I have time. 
1849,Thats great.  It must be rewarding.  My sister in law does some work in human rights.
1849,Oh yes very rewarding and thats great! Does she like it?
1849,She seems to.  She doesnt like me all that much so weve never spoken in great detail about her work.

1849,My favourite movie is the Muppet Christmas Carol.  What's yours?
1849,I love the frankenstein movie. I can actually recite the movie word for word
1849,Im not a fan of scary movies.  I was tormented as a child by the supernatural.
1849,Oh no. Im sorry! I hope things get better. it was great talking to you!
1849,You too!
1850,If you still know any of them tell them I'm single!!
1850,because i'm 6 feet tall it sometimes offends my shorter partners .
1850,Wow being that tall must be a fun time
1850,It's easier than being vegan
1850,Yeah that sounds difficult. How long have you been vegan?
1850,"I've been a vegan for about five years. I consider myself a dietary vegan, which means I don't eat any animal products."
1850,Man that must make you a healthy person. It must help you live longer. I wish I could live forever.
1850,It is healthy but It makes it hard to date
1850,I am a fan of free diving. Maybe you can try that as a date idea?
1850,I would probably enjoy that. Thanks for the idea.
1850,Yeah no problem. Has worked for me in the past.
1850,Well it was nice talking to you
1851,Do you have any favorites?
1851,"I don't have a favorite. I find many of them interesting. The range of topics is so broad, including scientific, cultural, and academic."
1851,True. So many choices. I personally like Jane Austen and most of the Russian Classics.
1851,Did Austen ever involve her life experiences into her work? I know a little about her but not much
1851,I don't know about her personal life
1851,My dreams are often bizarre especially after reading
1851,Very true. I am have three sisters and two brothers but keep having dreams of being an orphan.
1851,I hope you don't have many of those dreams again.
1851,Same here. I hate the Oliver Twist  reference.
1851,"Yes i love that book, its really sad though. "
1851,True. I love that book and David Copperfield. 
1851,yes i could not agree more with that .
1852,HI. I thought I should start the conversation. Could you tell me a bit about you?
1852,My father and grandpa worked in the circus. How's that for a fun fact
1852,"That's interesting. I wish my father were still alive. To tell a bit about me, I am a piano player at an upscale restaurant. "
1852,Wow! I would love t play the piano. Do you enjoy your job?
1852,It's ok but I have to play soothing music. Sometimes I want to rock. 
1852,What kind of rock?
1852,Anthing from my favorite decade of the 70s. Even stuff like the Beatles or Stones would be fun. 
1852,Do you like the movies?
1852,Yes. I just saw Joker last night
1853,Ok! Please share it. 
1853,I have a thing for the color blue.  what color is your underwear?
1853,That is completely inappropriate and makes me uncomfortable. 
1853,"Ok fine, moving on. My secret is that I do have a big thing for the color blue, how about yours?"
1853,I like to paint abstract art. I use a lot of dark earth tones in my paintings. 
1853,Ok right on. Do you sell any of it?
1853,Yes. I also am an excellent cook and do catering occasionally. What are your hobbies? 
1853,I enjoy submissioin grappling first and foremost.  I'm also pretty heavily into DIY.  Are you a homeowner?
1853,I don't know what that is. I do like DIY projects at home. I rent an apartment. 
1853,did you go for the one bedroom or two?
1853,I have three roommates and we each have our own rooms. It's pasta and Netflix night with them. I'm looking forward to it. 
1853,What are you watching on Netflix?
1854,what did you have for dinner?
1854,I made red beans and rice. It was crazy good.
1854,I eat all my meals alone now since my parents died last week.
1854,I'm sorry to hear that. Was it a car accident?
1854,"it was a hot air balloon crash. They always enjoyed the little things in life, it's something they passed down to me"
1854,"What an interesting way to go! I mean, it's horrible, but interesting."
1854,"In accordance with their wishes, I had their bodies thrown into a pod of orcas. Free Willy was dad's favorite film."
1854,Fascinating. Did you have to get some sort of permit for that or is it a case of renting a boat under the cover of night?
1854,"oh no, I flew a hot air balloon over the ocean and just dropped them in. That's how my family travels"
1854,The fuel must get expensive! What color of balloon do you usually travel in?
1854,"It's red, white and blue. We've always been very patriotic."
1854,"Aren't we all, in our own way? I, myself, have a tattoo of Lincoln riding a hippo on  my back. "
1855,Thats aswesome. I love the Band Chicago plus I live in Chicago as well.
1855,Early 2000s indie music are the best!  What do you do for a living?
1855,I am a IT admin. I love it.  How about you?
1855,I'm a student but want to be a teacher in the future.
1855,Thats great. What do you partents think about that.
1855,They think it is underpaying but rewarding.  They are ok with it.

1857,"Awesome. I can't wait to have some of my own one day. I'd have to move to a bigger apartment, though."
1857,"Yes, they need lots of room to play.  What do you think of the moon landing?"
1857,"I think it's fake, but I don't teach the kids that, ha ha!"
1857,I don't think it it real either.  Definitely a hoax.  
1857,"Wow, I don't meet many people who agree with me on that stance."
1857,Me either!  I guess we can all be gullible on some issues.
1857,That's so true. I really hope to open up some eyes of the next generation in my work.
1857,That would be great!  You have such an important role in their lives!
1858,"Yea, he has alot and we really dont have room for them anymore. "

1858,I agree. I have a lot of friends but its hard to find a true friend!
1858,Very true.  I find my best friends are the ones that I meet naturally through shared interests.

1869,What kind of crops? Do you sell through farm markets?
1869,"Corn, tomatoes, pumpkins and eggplants. Sometimes we do it but most of it we sell to private companies"
1869,Great! I wish I could live out in the country side. I am currently unemployed and sometimes think about going away from the City
1869,"It really is a peaceful life. But you know you have the mouse dilemma, if you live in Here you don't get killed or live in the city eating tasty."
1869,Yeah that is so true. May be I will make my mind and will move. How long have you been farming?
1869,"Well, if that's what you want for your life, welcome to the club friend! I've been 5 years now."
1869,Thank you. My only concern is not being able to attend concerts. I love concerts. My favourite band is Rush.
1869,"hahahaha I understand you, here there is tranquility and without stress. but you miss the spectacle of the big cities."
1869,Yes this is what I mean. And not being able to meet my friends as much as I want. This is what keeps me from running away.
1869,"Well, think about it, before making the decision. I must go, we'll talk later."
1870,"I never knew that, they made better sounds than the audio we use today"
1870,I completely agree. I love vinyl the most of all. My record collection is nuts.
1870,That's awesome that you collect. I'm sure it looks beautiful displayed in the house
1870,"It takes a lot of space! I'm not a hoarder, but you might think I was if you saw my records."
1870,At least you have a passion for music. The arts are dying.
1870,"Maybe. Or perhaps they're just changing? People draw on tablets better than they draw on paper, sometimes."
1870,"I agree, I want to see more of the integration. "
1870,Indeed. What kind of art do you like?
1870,"I have no one medium, so I go for mixed media"
1870,Mixed media is cool. Do you like to sculpt?
1870,Yes I do 
1870,"What do you like to sculpt? I like to make tiny dogs out of clay, myself."

1871,I love hanging with my friends at karaoke.  We love to sing.
1871,awesome ! i would rather go out and sing karaoke than stay in .

1871,true that. I once saw clowns drinking at the bar!
1871,I swear I met a guy who was a vampire.
1872,That's pretty weird to be honest...
1872,My Instagram followers love it. 
1872,"Well, to each its own I supposed. I like skating."
1872,Oooooooh. Skating could be a great work out also. 
1872,"Yes, a coworker of mine likes skating with me, and it is pretty cool."
1872,I should do a skate video for my Instagram. I wonder if they make croc skates?
1872,"I do not know, I think it is like a small market lol"
1872,You should try them sometime. Very comfortable 
1872,"Perhaps I could gift one of those to my coworker, I have a crush on her."
1872,Give it a go. You might be soulmates.
1872,"Hey, thanks, I will keep that on mind."

1874,"Oh, that's awesome you live in that kind of area. I enjoy getting the fresh veggies and fruits from the farmer's market. "
1874,"That's awesome. I try to buy local also to improve local economies and support the community. I also grow my own food such as squash, tomatoes, etc."
1874,Cool! How long have you been growing your own food? 
1874,Going on eight years now. My favorite color is purple so I try to grow stuff that is purple but theres not many purple plants
1874,"Wow, that's a long time. I like purple too! Do you grow radishes? or purple onions?"
1874,"Yes, definitely. I also grow eggplants and purple flowers. My lizard name Gila likes the leaves from the radishes"

1875,"So, you say you are a teenager.  Are you getting good grades in school?"
1875,I should be getting better grades but I just don't take it very seriously. 
1875,It's time to get with the program.  You don't want to be left out behind.
1876,yeah. I finished my college afterwards. what do you do?
1876,"I take care of the kids, the home and finances as a housewife. Which includes laundry, all the soccer mom stuff. Meals and all of that."

1877,That's pretty cool. Did you go see King Tut?
1877,Yes! I love ancient history so it was especially fascinating. Even though I'm more partial to Ancient Greek/Rome History
1877,I love greek and roman history. It's scintillating.

1880,that sounds fun
1881,Have you ever saved anyone?
1881,I haven't actually. I have come close but it was a false alarm.
1881,"well, thats probably for the best.  Is being a lifeguard a fulltime job?"

1882,what kind of truck does the vet drive?
1882,He drives a gianormous conversion van
1882,have you ever driven a Chevy Duramax?
1882,"No, I like them but I've heard they are a maintenance nightmare."
1882,It's my favorite truck of all time. It can carry 40 bushel of strawberries
1882,That is a very solid truck that you have.
1882,It's not very good on gas mileage
1882,I understand that my van isn't the best on gas. Gas is so expensive!
1883,"I'd prefer more than twice, but that would be excessive"

1886,Do you like museums?
1886,"I really do, all different kinds but especially art =)"

1888,"you could get a fish!, would you like me to recommend a species?"
1888,Oh no! I do not like fish. I probably would forget to feed it anyway
1888,A belly up fish in tepid water could jazz up your living space.  I have an aquarium for sale...
1888,"Oh that's cool. I'm really super busy. I live in new york, everything is go go go."
1888,"New York does not appeal to me, are you interested in moving?"

1893,"yes forsure, i am different then i was ten years ago, though i never did real bad stuff but im better now then i was then."

1893,"Oh honey, I have grandkids! Twenty seven of them!"
1893,oh wow that is amazing. just terrific

1893,thats such a good idea i love that.. i think i will do that with the cousins this year. im low on money.
1893,It's pretty affordable and a good way to help them eat healthy. I take lots of them to the farmer's market in the summer.

1897,Oh so you dress like black panther!!!!
1898,no i dont . ive always wanted to get one. i am not sure i can stand the pain 
1898,Tattoos really aren't that painful- you get used to it if they take a long time. The ink can irritate your skin though.
1898,do you have one ?
1898,Yes! I have thorns tattooed on my toes.
1898,nice . i guess they didn't hurt as much as i think they would

1899,"I work with children, at my home daycare. And you?"
1899,"I work all weekend, but it doesn't bother me. I get to go to the beach during the week."

1899,Oh work is great when its easy to go to :) do you make good pay?

1900,No only a shot time
1900,"Well its a good career path, weddings are expensive! And most people don't have the creativity to plan on their own.  What did you do before?"
1900,I was a stay at home parent before
1900,"I am too right now, but hoping to start a ""normal"" job soon. I don't talk a lot so my options are limited though."

1901,i hope so as well. It wasnt a bad break so it should heal fast
1901,It must be agitating having to get around with a broken leg.
1901,"its not ideal, but with crutches it isnt to bad."
1901,What kind of music do you listen to? I imagine you have more time on your hands now
1901,"mostly classic rock, Yes I'll be off work for a while most likely. What do you do to pass the time"

1902,"Some of it is decaff. I like flavored teas, too. Chai is really good. "
1902,"oh yeah. i love peppermint tea, i try and switch out my coffee for that at least once a day"
1902,"Oh, peppermint is good. I once had this strange watermelon flavored tea and made it really strong. It tasted like a jolly rancher. "
1902,"sounds good yum. although that sounds better suited to a cocktail than a cup of tea, lol"
1902,"It wasn't bad. Sometimes the flavored teas can be garish and i just like to stick with good, old fashioned hot black tea. "
1902,so where do you go hiking? 
1902,There are nature conservation trails around here in the state parks. 
1902,nice. do you hike alone or with family/friends?
1902,"I usually try to take someone with me, because of wild animals and other dangers."
1903,pepperoni pizza and iced tea are fairly iconic favorites for me to have. i do use a cauliflower crust.
1903,"pepperoni is great! Although, I'm not much of a fan of iced tea. Soda certainly pairs better with pizza!"

1904,Of course. Good luck with the music career. I'm rooting for you
1904,"Thanks, I want to work behind the scenes doing editing and mixing but I don't think it's any less creative. "
1904,Making music is a hard business to break into. The only way to make it is to keep practicing and to get a little lucky.
1904,Agreed. I'd rather not have my face all over but it'd be amazing to hear my music on the radio.
1904,i am sure ! i hope we can make the concert happen !
1904,Free tickets! lol
1904,"Oh, front row tickets make it even better! Have a great time."

1905,i'm sure he just wants more attention or treats have you trained him
1905,"Yes, I have tried to train him. Maybe it just takes some time. Do you have a dog?"
1905,"Yes, I have a beautiful German Shepherd dog. She is my best friend."
1905,"Aww, that's nice. How long have you had her?"
1905,She is three years old and I got her as a puppy. We play video games together.
1905,Oh wow! What kind of video games do you like to play?
1905,"We play role-playing adventures. She helps me to decide which choices to make, and I reward her when she makes a good choice. "
1905,Cool! Dogs are great companions.
1905,"Absolutely!  Although she does not like my taste in music. I enjoy Linkin Park, and she enjoys Disney music."
1905,"Aww, that's sweet. My dog likes all types of music."
1905,"Her favorite Disney song is one the dog pound song from the movie, Lady and the Tramp.."
1906,"The weather was nice like usual in California, just a little foggy."

1906,"Just driving around in my foreign car, living life as it comes to me."
1906,sounds fun. what else do you do for fun

1907,that's great! what kind of work do you do? is it similar to what your parents did?
1907,"Thank! I work as an insurance agent. My dad worked as an agent too, my mom was a teacher."

1909,"I'm from Dearborn, Michigan. Where are you from?"
1909,"I am an exchange student from Germany, studying in Pennsylvania"
1909,"That is interesting, what things do you do while living in America to keep your heritage alive?"
1909,I am playing on a soccer team
1909,I had an exchange student from Amsterdam living with me a couple years ago and she was on a soccer team too.
1909,I hope to make friends on my team. I have only been in the US for a short time
1909,Are you in 12th grade here? 
1909,I am in 10th grade. Are you a student?
1909,"No, LOL, I'm a senior citizen. I graduated from high school in 1968!"
1909,Have you ever been to summer camp?
1909,I went to summer camp when I was a kid. I hated it. I missed my Mom.
1910,I would like more to live the adrenaline of life or death situations.
1910,"That sounds so dangerous, I think I'll stick to something safer like fishing, because I really love to fish"
1910,"I could do it, I would not say that it is an activity that I would like to do constantly."
1910,"Yea, its an activity that I like to do with my black lab. He's still a 1 year old pup though."
1910,It certainly sounds like a pleasant activity with a partner like that. but I don't know just role-playing is exciting. Living as in the anime I see is great.
1910,"Yea role playing isn't bad, what anime do you like to roleplay as the most?"
1910,without a doubt my number 1 is death note. The character of L is incredible.
1910,Nice. Do you role play with other people in a group or by yourself?
1910,I have a community where we meet occasionally to play role-play. Super rewarding to share your hobbies with others.
1910,Do you ever go to role playing events or contest with a huge gathering of people?
1910,"I would love to do it sometime, but I don't know if I can take so many looks in a place like that haha"
1910,So who usually makes the costume for your role plays?
1910,"I do it myself, on one occasion I will show you how. But I have to go, we'll talk later"
1911,"i know, i was like... what the...? do i really look like i'm a glue sniffer?"
1911,Where did that happen at? I'll make sure i dont go to that store
1911,"it was just a little mom and pop stationary store, not a big name store. it was bizarre. that's what happens when teachers have to buy their own supplies!"
1911,"Yea, especially so when those same teacher aren't paid enough for the tough work that they do"
1911,yep :( So what do you do for a living?
1911,"My job is taking care of animals in a shelter, what about you"
1911,"im a teacher. oh my! that must be so rewarding, but heartbreaking at the same time!"
1911,Yes some animals come in more worse for the wear it is sad to see them like that
1911,i bet. have you adopted many yourself? im sure it must be hard not to take them all home!
1911,I have tried but the place I live is not too keen on residents having pets
1911,i bet. have you adopted many yourself? i'm sure it must be hard not to take them all home!
1911,"yes, i have 1 cat i got from my local shelter too"
1912,Engineering is where the real money is at though 
1912,Youre probably right. Do you have a college degree?
1912,yes ! 
1912,I don't. And I made more money than many of my friends who had degrees. I was a graphic designer.
1913,"American Movie, maybe?"
1913,"It was a Greek tragedy, but I don't remember the name. Do you larp?"
1913,I do not. How about yourself?
1913,"YUp, but I am a chubby fellow, so I am limited which characters I can play. For example, there are no chubby characters in the movie, X-men."
1913,"I mean, Gambit wears a trenchcoat. You could hide any excess body weight in that I would think. Beast would be good too!"
1913,"Nobody wants to see a chubby person in spandex. But I am dieting, and I hope to be slim soon."
1913,"I don't know, pro wrestling is pretty widely watched."
1913,"Good point. I am on the stick diet. I anything as long as is is a stick food. Carrot sticks, cellery sticks, fish sticks, etc."
1913,"I see, that's good. My friend from out of town does the same. I've had to fly out of the county to see him."
1913,"Nice. You can burn a lot of calories flying, but your arms get tired."
1913,"Haha, funny guy."
1913,That's what people say when I wear spandex!
1914,why like that?is there anything did you find difficult?
1914,I mean most of college was difficult in one way or another. Paper work is the worst.
1914,what type of paper work?is it related to your project or else?
1914,I mean when I was in college myself having to register for classes etc wasn't easy.
1914,oh!then how you will handle that works?
1914,I had to call the administration office a few times but eventually I was able to graduate. I'm a software engineer. 
1914,oh! congratulations.
1915,Why can someone not do something about that annoying fly?
1915,They are trying to get rid of all the insects in the house.
1915,"Well, this is unacceptable. How am I supposed to work? (Takes out phone to call someone and complain)"
1915,Just try to focus and I will take care of everything else.
1915,"Well, please try to be quick about it. My time is valuable and I don't need these types of frustrations."
1915,Yes. I need to study you know.
1915,You need? YOU need? I couldn't care less about what YOU need. What you NEED is to handle this situation!
1915,The fly is dead and I'm going to study my dentistry.
1916,I've never heard of The Chainsmokers. Have you?
1916,I actually have just been reading about them.  The duo is Alex Pall and Andrew Taggert
1916,I've never heard of them either lol. I'm in my 60s. Have you heard of The Beatles? lol They were from my day.
1916,I have. They are timeless
1916,I know I was kidding. What genre of music do you usually like?
1916,kind of pop and alternative mixed together. my favorite band is The Muggers
1916,I guess I'll stick to the oldies. I have no idea about any music from the last 15 years!
1916,LOL. That's all right. Some of the songs from that era are still great today

1917,since I was about 10 years old I think. Do you play the piano as well?
1917,No.  I'd really like to but haven't had the time for lessons.
1917,There are easy YouTube tutorials now in case you'd like to pursue :)
1917,They really work?  How did you learn?
1917,"I actually learned through an instructor but did not finish the full course. When I got older, I used YouTube to learn more. "
1917,Cool.  You play any other instruments?
1917,"Yep, I also play the guitar. How about you?"

1919,"It is! I'm loving the cooler weather, for sure."
1919,I've been told that sometimes it gets very humid though. That can't feel nice
1919,"Ugh, yes.  It will literally feel like you stepped into a sauna sometimes..."
1919,"Yeah that's why i'm more partial to Cali weather, doesn't get as humid most days"

1919,I would love to!  Hopefully one day.
1920,Yes he was a very smart man
1920,"I agree wholly, quite an impeccable spectrum. I read online on 4chan that da Vinci was likely an alien from the future."
1920,Maybe I think that there are such people among us
1920,"That's weird conclusion. But, Da Vinci does definitely hold secrets and died with them. He even might have created that very bizarre and undecipherable medieval book."
1920,I think that most super smart people do die with a lot of secrets. Not sure about medieval books not into those
1920,a very good point ! what else do you like to do in your spare time ?
1920,I have 14 horses so they keep me busy. How about you?

1920,I love them all but it does get overwhelming at times
1920,oh yes i can imagine. I hope everything goes well with them.

1923,Oh wow!  A little Brady bunch.. Im sure you have heard that before!

1923,All the time! YES! But they love on each other like best friends so it balances out. :) 
1924,"I have not, I save my money so that I can blog about owning a salt water aquarium."
1924,Me too. I chat about my fish pond in my courtyard. Do you have any very valuable fish in it?
1924,"Nothing crazy, I'm just starting out with it. It's very relaxing and I don't want to worry about killing anything expensive."
1924,I only have minnows in my pond. But they are fun to watch. Are you in college?
1924,Not anymore. Are you in college?
1924,No. I'm retired living in Florida. It's still warm here.
1924,"Oh wow, you must have great weather there. They don't grow peanuts down there, do they? I'm allergic to them."
1924,No peanuts here but just up north in Georgia. Are you in USA?
1924,Yup. In the North-East but grew up more toward the middle of the USA.
1924,I was born and raised in Michigan. Too cold and snowy for me there now. Do you have any other pets?
1924,I didn't grow up with pets so I never really got into owning pets until this whole salt water aquarium thing.
1924,I wouldnt mind having one of those too but can't really afford it now. I also own dachshunds.
1925,The ornament is in the shape of a cat
1925,That's so cute. Are you going to put it on your tree this year?
1925,"I sure am, I'm thinking of trying to find more of this type of ornament to add to it"
1925,That would be perfect! I'm sure she would love that
1925,"Thanks, Do you put up a tree?"
1925,I do! I look forward to it every year. Always a real tree too. Do you do a real tree or fake tree?
1925,"I prefer a fake white tree, with one specific color theme every other year."
1925,Thats a great idea. I bet it looks amazing! What color was it last year
1925,It was turquoise blue and silver.
1925,Wow that sounds so cute. I may have to steal that idea
1925,There really fun to do trying to find all the decorations in the color you choose. 
1925,I bet! It's probably nice to involve kids or grandkids too
1925,"It really is fun to do with your kids or grandkids, my daughter enjoys picking out ornaments every year."
1926,I WILL SHOW
1926,Will show what?

1927,"I am doing a lot better now, thank you!"
1927,Glad to hear.  Do you cook often?
1927,I'm single so I eat out a lot or do the microwave cooking. Do you like to cook?
1928,You're absolutely right. But you can use them for so much more! I only light my house with them.
1928,"I love the blue candles, they remind me of the ocean. Have you ever been to the ocean?"
1928,I haven't ever. What's so great about the ocean?
1928,"The calmness and serenity, the smell, it's just very relaxing. I'm sorry to hear you've never been before. "
1928,"Oh, it's ok. I can't swim anyway. Have you ever seen a shark there?"
1928,"I'm sorry, swimming is fun if you ever try it. I think you'd like it. I've seen only nurse sharks before, yes."
1928,"Oh that's cool! I like sharks a lot. There are a bunch at the aquarium and I got to pet one, once. "
1928,"Really, wow! I love sharks too.I've never touched one though.They are so cool looking!"
1928,"They really are. I want to pet an octopus next, but I""m not sure how to go about that."
1928,"Wow, octupus are weird looking and scary! Good on you though. You sound brave! Call the aquarium near you.Maybe they have a viewing."
1928,That's a good idea. I think octopuses are my favorite animals. They're really smart and interactive.
1928,I heard they are very smart. My favorite animal is the wolf or snake. We have tons here in the country! Have you seen any close up before?
1929,does your son like comics? I love them

1930,Do you like museums?
1930,I'm a big fan of museums but my main interest is in art museums
1930,"I see, I go to museums to see artwork depicting mythological figures!"
1930,That's very fascinating! Which era of art is your favorite?
1930,"the paintings mostly , i love art . mostly the older stuff from around the 1800s"
1930,That's awesome! When was the last time you visited a museum?
1930,i cannot remember but it was back during simpler times .
1930,Why are times not simple anymore?
1930,The museums are generally being more used now as a way to appeal to the public
1930,That's very true; I miss the times when the museums were passionate about what they were displaying
1930,Yes especially the public museums
1931,Because you guys were not ready for us.
1931,I apologize for that! Very inconsiderate! That must have annoyed you.
1931,Yes unfortunately. I don't like to waste my time when it could have been used wisely.
1931,I can understand that - unfortunately some times we have to do those annoying things in order to keep things level.
1931,Indeed. Hopefully this will not happen the next time and things will be fine.
1931,"I hope so too, and I hope that you don't have to deal with anything like that anytime soon."
1931,Indeed. I'm sure things will be smoother.
1931,I hope so! Do you have anything going on tonight? I'm just gonna watch a movie I think.
1931,"As of now, I got nothing. Most likely I will binge a few films as well."
1931,Sounds great! What's your fave movie?
1931,Hmmmm...the Jurassic Park series to be honest.
1931,"Okay...I love the Jurassic Park franchise! I named by dog after Blue, the Velociraptor."
1932,I am happy for her but I want a house too!

1932,"I take it you like to read then, what is your favorite genre?"
1932,I do! My favorite genre is probably fantasy.

1932,Oh that's a hard question. I like the Song of Achilles a lot. Anything by Neil Gaiman is good too. 
1932,I am not too familiar with him. I guess I have a new book to read!
1932,His book Good Omens was recently released as a TV show that is really good! Same with American Gods. They're super cool.

1932,No problem! Do you like to read? 
1932,"I do, although I don't have one specific genre I stick to. My library has quite an extensive collection."
1932,I always plan on trying out more genres but I'm really bad about always sticking with the things that are familiar.

1935,Me too!  My husband is planning on retiring next year though.
1935,"That's nice, I bet he's happy to retire"

1935,"Yes, that would be a wonderful experience.  I also plan to move to Florida or at least somewhere warm year round."
1935,"That's where I live now along the coast, My wish would be to be somewhere that gets snow sometimes."
1935,"Ha, I live in Arkansas.  The weather is a roller coaster ride here.  I would love to be where you are."

1938,"evansville , indiana . have you ever heard of it ?"
1938,No I have never been out that way

1938,Some day I would like to visit Colorado.  Have you ever been?
1938,Only Denver. I haven't seen the rest.

1939,Dogs are better anyway. How many dogs do you have?
1939,right now we have 5 dogs of different ages.
1939,Oh my word! That's a lot of dogs! Are they inside or outside dogs?
1939,All outside dogs.  the local rabbits don't even run off anymore but a cat gets them going.
1939,"Cats are so much wilier than rabbits. Rabbits, though, ate all my bell pepper plants this year, so they're on my list."
1939,Rabbit is delicious but can have a lot of  parasites.  Cats will hunt rabbit if given a chance
1939,I've never eaten rabbit. It seems like such a lot of work for so little.
1939,Not much eating on them thats for sure.  I have heard of people trapping them from their garden that may make it worthwhile
1939,That's a good plan. I spread dried coyote urine in my garden to keep them out.
1939,Did the coyote mind?
1940,Yes I do I have a 4 year old who I take swimming all the time!
1940,Awesome! I loved it so much I made a job out of it.
1940,Swimming or being a parent? haha!
1940,Definitely the swimming haha. No munchkins for me.
1940,Do you swim for fun or excersize? 
1940,"A little bit of both, but mostly for exercize."
1940,"same here, I have arthritis so my doctor reccomends swimming because its easy on my joints. "
1940,"Yes, it's much kinder to the joints such as the knees, unlike running."
1940,"Do you prefer swimming in a lake, ocean or pool?"
1940,I would say the lake.
1940, not me! One time I got thrown off a jetski and I saw a black colored snake pop its head up out of the water 
1940,Oh goodness that's terrifying haha. I hate snakes.
1941,Are you a profesional artists?? You sound like one.
1941,Yes I am.  I create things with my brain and my hands.  
1941,"That is cool. I am actually a ski racer, and believe onr not, I am scare of heights."
1941,"That is interesting.  I would like to try something new, but I haven't felt well after my dog died.  Things are just off for me."
1941,I am sorry to hear that.
1942,"Hi, I am a python programmer"
1942,"Oh okay, that's cool, what programs have you worked on?"
1942,"Well, I haven't really had a huge project to work on but I am forming a team for a RPG game."
1942,"Wow! That sounds like fun, what will the game be about?"
1942,"Well, back then, I used to play a game called Vampire-something. I was drawn to the conversation and the turn-based role playing theme of the game"
1942,"Okay, how long ago did you play that game?"
1942,That will be approximately 9 years ago.
1942,Quite a while ago then! What other games are you into?
1942,"Well, for odd reasons, I am a huge fan of Mortal Kombat. I play adventure, action, arcade and sport games."
1942,Fighting games can be so fun so I'm not surprised you like Mortal Kombat. Do you have must spare time to play games these days?
1942,Not really. I do extra stuff like go to the gym when I am not working on my project. Are you a gamer?
1942,"Hey me too! I love to go to the gym as well, and yeah I am really into League of Legends "
1943,Really. That is cool.I want tor try it.
1943,i am desserts type of person . what do you do ?
1943,"My dream was to be a jornalist, but right now I work at Sears."
1943,do you like working there ? I'm a people person so I like customer service work
1943,I hate it.The salary is trash
1943,Good paying jobs at those kind of stores just don't happen
1943,"You got that right, and the fact that everyone likes to buy things online makes thos kind of jobs worthless"
1943,I buy online most of the time. Holidays makes those kind of jobs busy
1943,I am going back to college to get my journalism degree
1943,Now that would be a good job. Good for you
1943,Do you have a not- realized dream?
1943,I dream of being able to travel for a year overseas
1944,I would definitely read that! Just make sure there are tons of burritos
1944,you got any good burritos around you ? i love burritos
1944,There are a couple of good local Mexican places but honestly I'm just happy with a burrito from Taco Bell. Delicious
1944,"I saw a video of someone putting saliva in Burrito, could that be real?"
1944,Ew I hope not. That's gross
1944,i believe it was real . . . but who knows ? really ?
1944,Oh no. Well anyway what else do you like to do in your spare time? I enjoy hiking and being outdoors
1944,I enjoy indoor activities plus do you bake?
1944,I've never really baked before. I have a lot to learn about cooking. What do you like to bake?
1944,everything bakable......... lol
1944,Haha. Chocolate chip cookies are my favorite!
1944,chocolate chip cookies are delicious
1945,I'm the oldest in my family. Rank hath its privileges. 
1945,"I am the black sheep in mine, self declared."
1945,"Sounds like we have a lot in common! I'm a dark sheep, too."
1945,I am myslef.I just do not care what my family thinks of me
1945,My parents raised us to be free thinkers so they can't complain too much about how we turned out.
1945,You are good enough.  I suppose the older children help take care of the younger ones.
1945,Thanks! I didn't get to be baby sitter too much because we're all close in age.
1945,It's good I went a bit older. Good for you.

1946,Yes its hard to keep up at the hospital
1946,What is your favorite part of working at the hospital?
1946,Taking bloodwork out
1946,I do not like blood. That would scare me. 
1946,What scares you?
1946,Blood! Seeing that much blood would make me drink more than I already do. 
1946,Seems like a deep issue to me
1946,It is. 
1946,How do you deal with it
1946,I drink because if I don't I am uncomfortable.
1946,As a nurse I would suggest seeing a doctor if you havent
1947,England is a really cool place.
1947,"england is fantastic , have you been before ?"
1947,"no, but i would love to go one day. i love traveling."
1947,I also enjoy traveling!  Where's your favorite place to visit?
1947,"I like Greece and italy a lot because I majored in Classics, so it's neat to see everything in person."
1947,"I'd die to get to Greece, History is my passion!"
1947,Mine too! It's super fascinating. Greece is also just plain gorgeous.
1947,Where did you study?
1947,I went to school on the coast in Charleston. It was lots of fun.
1947,That city is so pretty.  My wife and I went for our anniversary!
1947,"Oh what a coincidence! It's such a fun place to live, but crazy expensive."
1947,"I can imagine.  If I ever moved, I'd probably go out toward Folley beach."
1948,"i own a bar in downtown chicago, so I do not have a lot of chances to go to the woods"
1948,are there lots of snakes?
1948,"Not in Downtown Chigago, I do not thing so."
1948,i own a bar in chicago actually so the smell does not bother me .
1948,"I love the smell of Eggplants, and the taste"
1948,"eggplant is probably my least favorite food , thought someone has to eat it haha"
1948,"So, How is your bar doing? Is bussinnes good?"
1948,"anything is better than the bar scene - same people, same issues"
1948,"If you bored, you should change jobs"
1948,sounds like a great idea too
1948,yes.Your job should be fun for you also
1948,For sure...  I love working for my money
1949,"Slavery is such a sad thing, isn't it?"
1949,Well lucky for us we have minimum wage these days!
1949,Yes. I work in a shoe factory and although it is boring but at least we got to bring some money home. 
1950,"I need to, but I'm too busy. I spend all my time driving a cab."
1950,That isn't safe. Do you drink too much caffeine maybe?
1950,"Always! I like it in coffee ice cream, mixed with coffee. Then I get twice as much."
1950,"I love black coffee, but have to stop drinking it at 5pm or it affects my sleep. "
1950,I don't think I ever stop drinking coffee. It keeps me going.
1950,I'm sure that's why you can't sleep. I use gardening to keep me alert yet relaxed later in the day.
1950,"That sounds like a good thing to do. I used to garden, but I just work all the time now."
1950,"I think it's a good idea to evaluate your quality of life. Money is great, but you have to enjoy life too."
1950,"True. Everything is just so expensive and honestly, work keeps me out of the house, which is good."
1950,I get that. I spend too much time being lazy and watching netflix.
1950,Sometimes I watch it in the car between calls. Those are good times.
1950,Do you have a lot of down time between calls? Maybe you could sneak some naps in.
1951,what! what happened so sorry
1951,My neighbors were yelling all night.  They were really loud
1951,I know right! I feel your pain. I would knock their door lol
1951,"I would, but I do not live in the best neighborhood and I am worried about what they would do."
1951,"that's not too fair, you could have taken a little bit of sleep since they stopped"
1951,"True, but I am working on my homework.  I really need to do better at school"
1951,what course are you studying at school
1951,"I am studding psychology.  I enjoy the subject, but the homework is hard"
1951,"wow!!! good for you, it worth the stress though, when you know you will get a good pay after graduation"
1951,"I hope so.  Right now I am getting by with student loans, so I will need a good paying job"
1951,"look at the trophy ahead, the good pay at the end of the course, I wish you success and luck, sending hugs your way."
1951,Thanks!  I appreciate it.
1952,"Me as well, that's awesome! Do you love art?"
1952,Art makes life so much more interesting and even makes it tolerable at times when it would not be.
1953,one thing that helps me cope is long walks by the beach and thinking of the good times
1953,thats true it can be very relaxing
1953,do you have beaches where you live?
1953,there is one close by I always visit with my mom who works at a grocery store
1953,that's nice 
1953,the beach reminds me of this one time i saw an easter bunny in a closet at the beach store
1953,"wow that is random , you dont usually see that alot "
1953,it makes me nostalgic at times
1953,do you like going to the movie theaters?
1953,i go every once in a while
1953,i try to to go every couple of months tp take a break from my busy work schedule 
1953,hows your work
1954,Wow that sounds sooo good. What kind of shakes do you like?
1954,Any one with a sweet flavor reallY!
1954,I agree. Have you been to other countries?
1954,"i'd not know , i have never been out of the us ."
1954,I've been to Spain and London. London had some really good sweet pastrys
1954,"Oh, I bet that was fun and interesting visiting another country too."
1954,It was but not sure I would go out of the US anymore with all the problems now days
1954,That's fair. The same would be true in any other nation.
1954,I live in FL so it seems to be a melting pot for a lot of different countries. 
1954,I live right above you in GA!
1954,LOL I love GA it's so green and peaceful not all crowded like FL
1954,I wouldn't say that! ATL area is kinda craaaazyyY!
1955,eating lunch and uuu....
1955,Just chilling  watching things happening and people going by.
1955,oh..good..what lunch?
1955,Sub sandwich. I hope I get done with work soon.
1955,"okay, good..how is your work?"
1955,"Busy, but its rewarding because it also pays well."
1955,ooohh..okay..then?
1955,i love people and and the way we work . . so who knows
1955,good..i love nature and rain..
1955,What does that have to do with work?
1955,not link..but i like it..
1955,What?
1956,Freshly squeeze juice is better in my opinion. 
1956,"Honestly, I love all kinds of orange juice so I probably couldn't settle on a favourite. What other drinks do you like?"
1956,"I like coffee, and yes, orange juice is good. I should probably drink more of it for vitamin C. "
1956,"Yeah, coffee is a great pick me up but I do love how refreshing juices can be."
1956,"Yes, and I have read that vitamin C helps the formation of collagen, which I should think about because of my knee.. "
1956,Yeah in that case you should definitely try and drink some more! What's the problem with your knee?
1956,I recently had surgery after having pain in for a long time. 
1956,"Oh okay, is it feeling better now, or is it still painful?"
1956,It still hurts but I am hoping that the surgery will benefit it in the long run. 
1956,"I'm sure it will help long term as you say, was it arthritis?  "
1956,The doc seems to think there may have been a mild previous injury that sped up wear and tear. I like to play some sports. 
1956,"Yeah that does make sense, what sports are you interested in?"
1956,"I like basketball, and I play a little football. I'm hoping to get back out there soon. "
1957,"Yeah, I love watching movies after brewing a fresh cup of coffee"
1957,"I love coffee, actually. I drink a few cups every morning!"
1957,That's great to hear. Always nice to meet a fellow coffee drinker. What's your favorite flavor?
1957,Mocha and lattes are my favorites! How about you?
1957,I'm big on French vanilla and Hazelnut. Mocha is also a good one for me
1957,"Those are pretty good, I like the coffee to milk ratio."
1957,Definitely goes perfectly with coffee. Adds a very good taste 
1957,And espressos and cafe latte's are perfect in the winter and fall.
1957,"yeah, those are really good, especially during the seasons"
1957,Fall and spring are my favorite seasons. Can't deal with these extreme weathers lol.
1957,"Same here, not a big fan of winter weather lol. Springtime is perfect"
1957,Do you enjoy sports? 
1958,I also lost track of my cat
1958,When did that happen? Maybe you should look around?
1958,"it happened a little bit ago, it's hard to get around using a cane"
1958,Oh no! Is there anything I can do help? My grandma uses a cane
1958,If you could help me look it would be a great help.
1958,"I'm on my way. But for now if you could, keep your cat's food outside. Maybe he'll smell it and find his way back"
1958,"Good idea, thank you again for the help, usually i would call up one of my other friends but they're busy."
1958,Oh i understand. Give that a try. That's what I do when my cat disappears.
1958,"My cat really is a cheeky little rascal, i always need to constantly vigilant when going out my door."
1958,aww! that's real sweet. 
1958,Do you have any pets?
1958,I have a few. A dog. a cat and a squirrel
1959,"Yea, finally I have some evidence of all the work I put into this class. Feels good!"
1959,How is your class?
1959,It's fine overall. Happy to be done with it. Excited to get home so I can hang with my dog and chill. 
1959,There was a talking dog on the jimmy fallon show last night.
1960,I always cook breakfast on sundays. Its a nice weekend treat.
1960,What do you typically cook for breakfast on Sundays?
1960,"Eggs, toast, bacon, sometimes an omelette. Always coffee!"
1960,That sounds great. I usually cook something sweet to go along with it; like french toast.
1960,"That's a great idea! My girlfriend is usually gone for work by the time I get out of bed, so I just cook for myself."
1960,I understand that far too well. Saturdays and Sundays are the only days I am able to cook breakfast since I have to work early on the weekdays.
1960,"Yep, that's me too. What do you do?"
1960,"I open a bakery each morning at 4 am. Typically, I'll just eat something there."
1960,Oooooo I bet the smells in there are great!
1960,"It does! I could never get tired of it, haha. What do you do?"
1960,"I'm an accountant, so no good smells at my job haha"
1960,"Wait, no one brings doughnuts into the office in the morning? "
1961,Bach for sure has such demand! 
1961,"Yes, he was the best musician ever."
1961,What type of visual art do you enjoy?
1961,I personally like both Eastern and Western art. Do you have a preference?
1961,Western is my preference but I appreciate all. It's inspiring.  
1961,Do you know that  Western Music is composed by and about the people who settled and worked throughout the Western United States and Western Canada?
1961,"No I didn't know about that, it's interesting. "
1961,How about classical music?
1961,"Classical music is my favorite genre of music, I love the brass   "
1961,i prefer the brass Instrumentation  over percussion myself
1961,It's very amazing and takes over!
1961,Yeah nothing beats the sound of a finely tuned snare drum
1962,"Some people just never seem to gain weight, I have to work at staying fit."
1962,It gets harder as you age. My daughters eat everything in the house and are tiny.
1962,"Yes it does, my metabolism has slowed way down for sure."
1962,It's the worst. Mine too. I used to live on potatoes but can't now.
1962,I guess it is a good thing that I like going to the gym and working out.
1962,I wish I liked working out. What kind of exercise do you enjoy?
1962,I love the elipitcal and free weights. I also swim three times a week.
1962,I do enjoy elliptical. I like to watch TV while I do it.
1962,I watch tv when I am on the treadmill too. I love to watch true crime like forensic files.
1962,I'm a true crime buff myself! I love podcasts about it.
1962,Me too! I listen to Crime Junkie. I am also a trivia buff
1962,"I've not heard Crime Junkie, but I love Criminal with Phoebe Judge. What a voice!"
1963,What are you're favorite books?
1963,Game of thrones is my top one. I love the books and the series. 
1963,I love the show!  I have not yet read the books but they are on my list to read!  What kind of job do you have?
1963,I work as a sales person but my dream job is to be a swim instructor since I love to swim.
1963,"That would be awesome.  You can do definitely do it, and open up a swim shop for kids!  I want to work in the federal court system"
1963,That looks like a fun job. What do you like about the job?
1963,"Well I have always been interested in law, but I like the federal system because the cases are more interesting to me"
1963,"i bet you come across some interesting cases , eh ?"
1963,Yes I do.  But it also makes me feel good to be doing my part in society.
1963,How would that compare with court of appeals and legal issues that conflict?
1963,"Court of appeals are handled in the federal system also, but I usually handle new cases. "
1963,That is amazing. I will remember you the next time I am in a case. Hahaha
1964,"how, kinda needs tips on that"
1964,I'd recommend going on some dates with them and then try to explore and see if you are romantically compatible with them.
1964,"sometimes because you see them everyday, they are boring"
1964,I understand that also. You just have to find a way to make things exciting. 
1964,"when you married to them, you feel stucked, it is amusing to flirt a little bit with someone new, they will shower you with love"
1964,Flirting can be extremely dangerous though. Especially if the one you truly love finds out. 
1964,will make sure they don't find you.........lol
1964,"Or that too, haha. Just be careful!!!"
1964,"thank you, will try to be "
1964,"just be nice , and friendly . oh and know when to listen ."
1964,"Will definitely do that, hope I don't get caught... haha"
1964,"Whatever you do, just make sure you are able to leave your home!"
1965,I was just looking at pictures from my latest rap performance. 
1965,Whoa that's exciting! Are you successful?
1965,Mildly. We perform locally mainly. 
1965,"I admire that. I love going to local shows with my sister. I often wish I was talented musically, but I'm just not."
1965,I love singing and rapping. It brings me joy. What brings you joy?
1965,"My sister and I go on yearly trips to Vegas, which is SO fun! We're thinking of moving there in the next few years."
1965,Oh wow! I have never visited there. That must be quite the adventure. 
1965,"It really is. The casinos are fun, but the performances are where its at. We have fun going out to the desert for small adventures too!"
1965,You are making me want to visit there!
1965,Oh you should! There are always great hotel deals and flights tend to be cheap too depending on when you go.
1965,I wonder if I could line up a performance out there for my group? That would be amazing. 
1965,I'm sure you could! There are smaller venues in the downtown area that I bet would work. 
1966,"I've travelled around alot so I'm not so bad with them anymore, but I used to be terrified too"
1966,Do you work for someone?
1966,"I do, I am a marine biologist and they send me around the world to collect field research"
1966,that's amazing . i would enjoy having that job . I am a business man.
1966,"Oh okay, I'm sure there are interesting parts of your job too? What kind've thing do you do in the office?"
1966,mostly paperwork and meetings . what do you want to do after highschool ?
1966,Fortunately I am already past highschool. I always wanted to be a biologist and fortunately I fell into the career of my dreams. 
1966,Good. Hope you've an wonderful career ahead!
1966,"Thank you, I really like to try different beer as I travel. Do you like beer?"
1966,yes beer is always good i can get an endless supply
1966,"Wow, how do you manage to get the endless supply? Are you bosses really generous? "
1966,That is a secret.
1967,I worked as a clown once actually 
1967,I was just a clown. It was fun for a while but then it got tiring. We weren't being treated right.
1967,So what do you do now? 
1968,"I did not, but all of our birthdays are listed on the company calendar for everyone to see."
1968,"I would personally like it if mine were forgotten about, as it always is embarassing and forced feeling when the singing starts."
1968,LOL They were just waiting to surprise me.  They gathered around and sang to me at the end of the day. I was embarassed.
1968,Must've gave them a good chuckle. Don't worry. They'll get over it.
1968,I am sure they will.  The all got together and gave me a little duck statue wearing a rain coat
1968,What is the significance of the duck in the raincoat between you and your co-workers?
1968,I collect toys wearing rain coats.  I have a few of them at my desk
1968,"Ohhhh, I get it. How cute! Do you have any fish in rain coats yet?"
1968,I do not.  If you see one somewhere let me know.  That would be a very unique item to add to my collection!
1968,"A duck is ironic, but a fish is the ultimate, and if I see one ever I'll just get it for you myself!"
1968,Sweet!  Thanks!  Do you collect anything?
1968,Besides debt? Actually I do- I collect all things skull and skull related.
1969,Do they get along now?
1969,"I mean, they don't throw things at each any more, so yea I guess so."
1969,Yikes.  I'm glad for that.
1969,Me too! I guess I could always just turn my music up and drown out their noise
1969,My soon to be ex-wife and I are getting divorced.  We have a a seven year old.
1969,"That's tough, sorry to hear that. How long have you been together?"
1969,We were together for thirteen years.  Married for eight.  It's actually for the best for everyone.
1969,Well that
1969,Yeah.  Definitely much happier apart.
1969,How is the kid taking it?
1969,He's doing well
1969,That's good to hear.
1970,Rock is my favorite for sure! you? 
1970,"I love rock. That is my favorite as well. Not much for pop music, but the 80s had great pop music because it was mostly rock. "
1970,Rock is just demanding and powerful! 
1970,"Yes, and it's hard to beat in almost any decade. I'm a fan from the earliest classics to more modern examples. "
1970,Modern rock can be amazing too
1970,"Yes, although I'd argue it doesn't get as much of a spotlight as it should. "
1970,It should get more love mainstream
1970,"I agree. I don't know if you'd consider Disturbed as rock or metal, but they've done some great old covers. I hear Draiman wants to sing the national anthem."
1970,Disturbed seems more metal but it's close! 
1970,"Yeah, it kind of went mainstream and they have some rock covers. I don't think they'll let him do it. I voted for him, though. "
1970,"I'd love for Draiman to sign the anthem, I hope it happens. "
1970,It would be awesome. I get tired of pop singers being chosen for every event. 
1971,I hope she's okay too.
1971,I'm sure it will be okay! 
1971,I'll call her soon and check up on her. If she doesn't answer I'll probably go look for her.
1971,Keep alert and be safe.
1971,"I wonder where she could be. She couldn't have gotten far, right?"
1971,Maybe someone found her and took her in.
1971,"That would be worse in my opinion, some stranger taking her in."
1971,"That might be true, maybe you should look for her!"
1972,"I am recently retired so I have a lot of free time, so exercise should be easy!  Do you exercise?"
1972,I love lifting weights
1972,Thats good.  Do you set goals on how much you lift?
1972,I try to increase my weight every time. Its easy since I have a workout room in my mansion that I just bought.
1972,Oh very nice.  Do you have a big family?
1972,I have a small family since I live in japan
1972,"And you bought a mansion!  Wow, do you like to cook"
1972,I cook every once in a while
1972,"I like to cook healthy meals, especially with the new diet I am on.  Do you cook healthy meals for your weight lifting?"
1972,I cook a lot of chicken breast and rice
1972,"Chicken is on my menu a lot (because of the diet), but not the rice... Is that your main protein source?"
1972,Chicken and protein shakes
1973,"It has to be the scent of roses, I REALLY enjoy roses"
1973,I would choose berry. Its my sons favorite
1973,"Nice, How old is your son?"
1973,"I have 4 sons. 25, 20, 16, an 8 years old"
1973,"Oh wow, you guys wouldnt happen to be from Canada would you?"
1973,No wre from the states
1973,"I love canadian women, I find them incredibly attractive"
1973,Yes they are extremely pretty
1973,Do you like roses at all?
1973,I like the smell of them
1973,"Sometimes, I like to relieve myself on them"
1973,I would have to try that one day. 
1974,I think net neutrality is very wrong and should be stopped. 
1974,"they are quite expensive as well, "
1974,do you think it'll ruin the internet? 
1974,"not really, since they vary by region"
1974,What's views on TV? 
1974,"CNN glued to news, staying updated"
1974,"Interesting, do you lean a lot there?"
1974,oh yeah!!! quite a lot especially politics
1974,What side are you on in politics? 
1974,"I'm actually on all side, I just like the good people"
1974,"Same here, independent all the way! "
1974,"that's a good one, being independent had worked for me several years and I love it. I love only those doing the right thing"
1975,I get that. My ex boyfriend had a car like that. What do you do?
1975,I intend to fix my dad's old Chevrolet covet pending when I am buoyant enough to pay for a new car
1975,That's so cool! Are you a mechanic?
1975,"not even skilled, i'm just cheap lol I didn't want to spend 500$ on something i could fix for 160$"
1975,"Hey, that's what youtube is for. My ex used to learn so much on there and then fix things."
1975,I like using You Tube to get instructions when I don't know what I am doing
1975,It's so useful for pretty much literally everything!
1975,I love it. What do you do?
1975,For work? I'm part-time at a vet clinic as a receptionist.
1975,"That's cool, i bet you see a lot of nice pets"
1975,So many! That's one of the major perks! They make me laugh constantly
1975,Yea pets are so cute and provide great emotional support
1976,I'm a teacher so I don't have as much time to play as I'd like
1976,I bet its hard to teach others
1976,"It can be, but it's rewarding too. "
1976,What are your favorite artists
1976,"Led Zeppelin is my favorite, yours?  "
1976,Mine is Jimmy Hendrix
1976,Guitar is such a beautiful sound  
1976,Its my favorite since im learning how to play
1976,How long have you been learning?
1976,About a month now
1976,I hope you learn to shred those lines! 
1976,Ill try to be like hendrix
1977,I like it but it is not my favorite instrument. I rather do drum or sing or rap. 
1977,The drums takes a lot of work also. Do you play the drums?
1977,Just a little bit. I prefer singing or do rap music. How about you?
1977,I am not much of a singer. Outside of violin I enjoy visiting national parks.
1977,I love the parks. Which one is your favorite?
1977,I like Yellowstone national park
1977,I have never been there but I heard it is beautiful. Is it the one with glacier? 
1977,"I do not think it has a glacier, no"
1977,Oh my bad. Where is it?
1977,It's mostly in Wyoming and a little bit in Montana. 
1977,Oh cool. Do you live around there?
1977,No. I just visited on a road trip. It's definitely a good place to check out.
1978,"I own my own salon as well, business has been great lately."
1978,How long has it been open
1978,Around 5 years now
1978,Was it hard to start
1978,"Yes, raising the money was tough. Hard for people to take you seriously sometimes when you have purple hair!"
1978,I wouldnt want my children to have that color thats for sure.
1978,Why is that?
1978,Im a family man and would like them to keep clean appearances. 
1978,Well that's your opinion. How many children do you have?
1978,"I have 3 kids all in school, I take them bowling a lot"
1978,"That sounds nice, I bet they have fun! I'm terrible at bowling."
1978,I can teach you since ive bowled at 300!
1979,What with work and family it is hard to make time to travel
1979,"Yes , other places around the world may be difficult to travel too, depending on the destination you choose."
1979,I can't wait to go to Fishermans Warf. Have you been to CA?
1979,"no , i should have though . i was in mexico four times for business this year ."
1979,Where did you go in Mexico? I hve never been there.
1979,One time in Cozumel and one time on the 
1979,Isn't there a lot of problems there like I hear on the news?
1979,I wouldn't say that. I think it has more to do with it's history and the fact that it is bordered by the gulf of mexico.
1979,My brother tries to go to Belize once a year and the pictures he sends me are beautiful.
1979,"I went there on a cruise and it was beautiful. It is bordered by the United States, the Pacific Ocean, Guatemala, Belize, The Caribbean and the gorgeous Gulf of Mexico."
1979,I live in FL on the Gulf and it is nice but a lot of people and tourist this time of year
1979,"yes when I lived there they were building so many hospitality venues (resorts, hotels) nearby and it wasn't as fun anymore for locals."
1980,"I like to write my own songs, so it really helped me get through my health scare."
1980,That's really awesome! What kind of lyrics do you write?
1980,Mostly country ballads.  But I have taken formal music lessons since I was 5 so I can play several instruments too.  Do you play or write?
1981,Where do you work?
1981,"i work in healthcare, for a government agency"
1981,"Cool, so you are a life saver."
1981,"sort of, i guess i am hoping for others to have a better go than i did. "
1981,You are really a good person. I am working in finance.
1981,"nice, what do you like about it? "
1981,I love my job very much.
1981,so you like the money then? 
1981,Of course. Who does not like it?
1981,"well, sure. i guess, but i mean isnt there more to life than just cash"
1981,"I agree to that. But to experience other things, we need money first."
1981,absolutley. but i would argue the most vlauable things in life you cannot rent/own or buy
1982,"No, they are creepy with their 'crawliness', if that is even a word. I am scared of snakes. What is the fear of snakes called?"
1982,I think it is Orphidiophobia? I may be wrong though
1982,"You are even closer to a word than I ever can. Frankly, I know like only three phobia and I am out. LoL."
1982,Yeah im no expert on phobia names either if I'm honest. Snakes are scary but they can be cool pets 
1982,"Yeah, there are some really cool ones but I wonder how people have burmese pythons as pets. Those things grow really HUGE!!!"
1982,"I heard the bigger the snake, the more attractive you are to women. Me myself, I don't have them problem anyway"
1982,"whoa! I am literally peeing myself just by thinking about snakes. Quick question, do you have a snake pet?"
1982,"I don't have a pet snake, I like to spend my money on designer clothes so I can flex on my friends"
1982,"That's cool. If you had enough money to get one of the cool ones, would you get yourself a snake instead of a dog or cat?"
1982,"Possibly, I do really love dogs though, especially big guard dogs"
1982,"I adore dogs. My favorites are beagles and Labrador retrievers. If i sure see a snake 7 feet around me, I am running as fast as I can."
1982,"Labradors have such a lovely personalities. Yeah, I guess snaked grow to be alot bigger then dogs."
1982,"Definitely, I saw a video on youtube, where two dogs ripped a snake in half. That was disgusting to watch."
1983,Must be really expensive then?
1983,"You know, I don't think I've ever seen one."
1983,"I am planning to purchase one, will let you know how it is."
1983,They must be really expensive. Are you wealthy?
1984,Yeah it did. I remembered everything about learning to skateboard in front of the house. 
1984,Some things like that you wont ever forget thats pretty rad
1984,Yeah my dad taught me and it was a really cool memory to think about. Do you skateboard?
1984,I havent since I started college
1984,Is college taking up a lot of your time?
1984,yes but in a good way.  what have you been doing lately?
1984,I actually started college as well. Been trying to get involved in campus activities.
1984,"good idea, what have you check out?"
1984,the animal's rights groups and some the honor society for my major.
1984,Sounds like some good stuff
1984,I'm having a lot of fun. Do you do anything on campus?
1984,Naw. Drink and play Xbox mostly.
1985,"No, never had the chance to sadly."
1985,where did you grow up ?
1985,"I grew up in Dublin, what about you?"
1985,"Ireland, land of castles.  so, do you like dogs?  I have one named percy"
1985,"I love them, how long have you had your dog?"
1985,1 year.  he loves the thomas the tank engine show like me.  do you like that show?
1985,"I used to watch it all the time, I have a niece and nephew that love it"
1985,I have a niece and nephew.  how old are yours?
1985,They're 15 & 16
1986,Did you know they have a twitch channel that plays nothing but bob ross shows
1986,I didn't know that. That's pretty awesome. He's a legend. 
1986,Yep he the goat Greatest of all time.  Cheers me up when I spend a super long day at my accounting job
1986,Oh that cannot be fun but at least you have a good way to relieve stress.
1986,Yep its nice to stop thinking about all those numbers and just have happy little thoughts 
1986,"That is true. My little sister loves Bob Ross too and she's only in 1st grade. then again, I think it was made for children."
1986,"Made to bring out the child in all of us , I am such a fanboy lol"
1986,It brings out the best in most I'd say.
1986,Yea if we more people like him we be a much happier world
1986,I can agree. There needs to be more people who find the good in all the bad. 
1986,Perfect way to say that 
1986,Hopefully there will be a Bob Ross in the next generation. But not a millennial appealing one 
1987,It is not only useful but also makes successful.
1987,My biggest issue with businesses is that they're not always fair and ethical
1987,Most of them are not ethical because everyone runs behind money instead of trust.
1987,"Yeah exactly, I wonder if they were all religious if they would follow God's word, and be more fair to others?"
1987,Do you like music?
1987,"I do actually, what kind of music do you listen to normally"
1987,Rock and roll. How about you?
1987,"I really like choir and sometimes I can listen to pop. How about movies, what kind of movies do you like?"
1987,I love crime and action movies.
1987,"Oh wow, I love seeing a criminal get taken down in crime documentaries and films, do you?"
1987,Mostly. But I prefer detective movies
1987,Would you ever want to be a detective yourself?
1988,It was a bit of both
1988,It's a little dangerous to do that these days.  Do you play any instruments?
1988,I play the piano
1988,So do I!  How long have you been playing piano?
1988,About 3 years
1988,"Nice, I've been playing for 5 years.  I like to play classic the most.  How about you?"
1988,Im more of a modern type of guy.
1988,I see.  What type of music do you listen to?
1988,More modern hip hop
1988,Do you know how to hip hop dance?
1988,I dont know how to dance at all.
1988,me neither!  I would love to learn though.  What are you hobbies?
1989,I'm in the in the panhandle of Florida. How's your weather?
1989,"It's getting chilly, and that is why I'm snowbirding to Florida this winter. Good luck on the soap. "
1989,I don't blame you.  I'm originally from the North and don't miss the ice and snow at all.  Have you tried compost soap before?
1989,"I haven't heard of compost soap, but I am familiar with them separately. "
1989,Yes it's an interesting concept.  I like to try do things more naturally.  That's one reason I like being a fruitarian.
1989,"As an environmental engineer, I'm curious. However, my work seldom has me working on personal care products. "
1989,"That's cool, what kind of projects do you ordinarily work on?"
1989,I'm more focused on efficient applications of energy. What is a fruitarian? Are you a juicer? 
1989,"We basically don't eat meat, dairy or a lot of vegetables. We do include nuts, seeds & grains."
1989,That sounds interesting. Why no vegetables? Is there something you find unfavorable about them? 
1989,"Many fruitarians don't eat them, but it can be hard for your body to digest many different vegetables."
1989,"Yeah, there is a lot of cellulose, which is in fruit but fruit has rapidly assimilating carbs. I eat a lot of nuts and seeds, too."
1990,No cause the people here in my town are nice
1990,"wow , good to know , what will happen if you go to your office with flip flops ?"
1990,I probably would get sent home.
1990,"fun . i'm self employed , so i lounge around in flip flops all day. I draw online comics!"
1990,"Thats good, comics are big here in germany"
1990,Wow that's so cool! Do you read any?
1990,Some spiderman comics
1990,"Oh, are you a marvel fan?"
1990,"Yes I am, I love all of them."
1990,I haven't seen any because there are so many and you should watch them in order
1990,Yes that is what is the best
1990,Who is your favorite Marvel hero?
1991,puerto rico. Thats good to have family.
1991,Oh Okay...I have six brothers and sisters altogether.
1991,"Nice, my parents raised me as budhist"
1991,Oh that's interesting. Are they good people?
1991,"They have their ups and downs, but they are nice deep down."
1991,"i understand.....mot to change the subject but the future, based on the present looks scary."
1991,It can be scary to think that way
1991,"Yes, no sense worrying about it i guess."
1991,Just think positive like in my religion
1991,I'm for any religion that's about improving someone.
1991,Thats what I look for in my religion
1991,"I think that's for the best, because actions are what's happening. Thoughts don't help people, actions do."
1992,i like your step mother
1992,"I like her too, but I don't think you know her! My name is Todd by the way, what's yours?"
1992,my name is scott
1992,That's a nice name. Do you have a favorite superhero?
1992,"yes i like captain america, what's yours?"
1992,Spider-man! When I grow up I want to be a superhero like him.
1992,oh! really nice Me also Like Spider-man!
1992,He is a great superhero. I love Marvel comics.
1992,Me also which marvel movie you like most!
1992,Other than Spider-man the Avengers movies are really great.
1992,yeah! its awesome
1992,The Avengers have been in several cool movies! One I saw recently was Ant-Man and the Wasp.
1993,"Anything but chocolate. I'm not OPPOSED to chocolate, but too much of it is just not appetizing to me."
1993,"I don't like chocolate either, actually. Everyone else seems to love it though. "
1993,"Right? Both of my kids love it, but all of these ""chocolate overload"" deserts are just way too much."
1993,"I like vanilla much more, but everyone thinks its so plain. I just like the simplicity. "
1993,"I can do vanilla, but if I had my choice, it would be straight-up strawberry. I'm much more into fruit flavors."
1993,"Oh strawberry is good too. I love Strawberries and Cream flavored things, so does my fiance. "
1993,Absolutely! Fresh strawberries in vanilla ice cream and just about any man could have his way with me. haha
1993,I love strawberries on things like pancakes and french toast too. Fruit is just so good. 
1993,That's my weakness. I could eat fresh fruit in place of just about any food on earth. It's just so refreshing.
1994,She's deceased and my father is in his 80's
1994,my mom doesn't crochet
1994,sorry to hear that. I have 8 brothers and we are pretty tight.
1994, I'm so sorry about you father 
1994,Thank you. He's alive though and doing fairly well.
1994,It's good news
1994,I thank you. So what's up in your world?
1994,i live with my mother and father. they are very nice
1994,Oh okay. Glad to hear that. Not everyone is so lucky.
1994, what do you like to do in your free time?
1994,"play guitar, play with my twin cats and watch movies, you?"
1994,I really like reading and going to the movies too
1994,:) thanks
1994,you are welcome
1994,:)
1995,Nothin thank god I can't afford to lose any more toes 
1995,"Glad you are ok?  What do you mean ""lose any more toes""?!?!"
1995,well when I was a youngin I lost 2 toes on my right foot to a alligator 
1995,"Oh my goodness, you have the craziest luck with animals!"
1995,they all seem to want a piece of me haha
1995,Well hopefully that was the last dangerous encounter.  Maybe you should write a book.  :) 
1995,Yea maybe I should you got any interesting stories
1996,Ha ha it is easy way to remember birthdays.
1996,"Haha, true, I don't use facebook but this person has been a life long friend to me. I should of remembered!"
1996,What's your favorite food?
1996,"Pizza, preferably with lots of meat!"
1996,oh i too like pizza very much.
1996,What is your favourite pizza type? My name is todd by the way.
1996,I love chicken pizza. I am Tina
1996,Very nice. Chicken goes well with a lot of things
1996,Yup. What is your favorite type of pizza?
1996,"Deep pan meat feast, possibly with a BBQ sauce base. Extra cheese too and a stuffed crust if I'm feeling rich."
1996,It is feeling rich even by hearing your taste.
1996,What drink do you normally have with your pizza?
1997,I'm not the biggest fan of flying but i've gotten more comfortable with it the more times I fly
1997,"Same here, but I normally do have to fly at least once a year."
1997,"I fly a few times each year, usually to visit some out of town friends "
1997,That's a lot more than I do!  I pretty much only fly to California to visit my son and his family.
1997,"Oh, that's really cool. How far away from them do you live?"
1997,Approximately 2000 miles...I'm in the Midwest.
1997,"Ah, gotcha. What time of the year do you tend to fly out to California?"
1997,"Usually over the holidays, but last year it was also in April for my grandson's spring break from school."
1997,That's cool. Does it tend to be hectic traveling there during the holidays?
1997,"Usually it has been, but last year I flew in and out of different airports than normal, and it was much better!  "
1997,That's good to here. I try to fly into different airports for the same reason. Can definitely make a big difference
1997,I can tell you I'm a convert!  Plan to do that for all future trips there!  Made the whole experience more enjoyable!
1998,What do you do for a living?
1998,"I'm in healthcare, but I do some side investing as well."
1998,I also do some side investing. Do you day trade?
1998,"No, I can't with my schedule. I just manage what I can but it's more long term focused."
1998,"That's understandable. It's been a pretty calm earnings season so far, given how disastrous a lot of people thought Q3 was going to be"
1998,I guess it depends on what the next couple of years hold.It can change very suddenly.
1998,That's true. I made all my bets this year hoping that political pressure would sort of force a china trade deal. Here's hoping one gets done
1998,"Yeah, it's hard to tell what is going to happen with that. Investing is even more of a roll of the dice than usual."
1998,"For sure. Things are pretty erratic, but it's provided lots of opportunity to buy low"
1998,That has helped quite a bit. It feels good to ride a wave back up.
1998,What has been your best performing security this year?
1998,"I went tech, they have been doing fairly well. I'm a bit concerned another bubble is coming though, so I may pull out next year."
1999,"No, I just always thought my house was hounted"
1999,I'd be more afraid of a break-in and always get mad and run around my house looking for them. Hauntings are better than break-ins. 
1999,I don't know. I just grew up with a lively imagination since my father wrote book and all.
1999, I think they are possible but i stopped being afraid of ghosts a long time ago. I'd be more interested in what they want. What was the book about?
1999,He was an author and wrote several books but he mostly wrote sci-fi. We always did imaginative playing growing up.
1999,"Oh, that must have been interesting! Was he into aliens? "
1999,"That too. Anyhow, what do you like to do in your free time?"
1999,"I like to read things online, watch TV, play games and eat way too much fast food. "
1999,Nice ... I like travelling the most. Visiting new places excites me.
1999,"Sounds good. I can't afford to get too excited. I had a stroke and have to take medications to prevent another. Too much unhealthy living, I guess."
1999,Maybe you should lay off the fast food then?
1999,"Yeah, I probably should. It's just kind of hard to resist and I'm a terrible cook on a low budget. "
2000,"bath bombs smells nice, though depends on the product and chemicals used in the making process"
2000,Bath salts aren't the same as bath bombs right?
2000,"I don't think so, but some people use both together"
2000,"Ah, that makes sense. What do the salts themselves do?"
2000,"if you are sensitive to scent, bath salt would be he best idea"
2000,Which do you prefer?
2000,"I love scent, what about you?"
2001,"An improvement, I think. Hot dogs are gross. "
2001,gross . they are just awful !
2001,They are! but the french fries there are so good. They're my favorite. 
2001,Nothing beat s a nice order of crispy french fries and a nice drink
2001,"Some people like to dip their fries in a milkshake, but I never saw the appeal. "
2001,Yeah i don't understand either. The fries would warm the mlikshake and the fries would be cooled by it.
2001,Exactly! But to each their own. 
2001,exactly ! what else do you do ?
2001,"Well I'm an elementary school teacher, so I spend a lot of time with kids. "
2001,I like kids but I wouldn't want to work with them all day. must get tiring at points
2001,"Oh for sure, but I don't mind. Most of the time it is a fun job. "
2001,What grade do you teach specifically? I would imagine the older kids are easier to teach.
2002,Is this a passion of yours?
2002,"Not really, I just go where the money is at.  How about your career? rewarding?"
2002,I am a vintage car collector. It's always been a passion of mine
2002,"Oh man, my dad just sold his 1940 Ford two door deluxe sedan.  What is your favorite classic car?"
2002,Aston Martin DB5. British cars are phenomenal 
2002,what year is that Aston Martin?
2002,1950. I have it in olive green
2002,"Awesome.  So, do you collect, restore, and then resell?"
2002,Yes. They are typically in poor condition. There's a lot of work that goes into fixing them!
2002,Is that DB5 one that James Bond drove?
2002,Yes. It's popularity sky rocketed thanks to the movie
2002,"Yeah, I thought as much.  So, any modern cars that you really like?"
2003,"No, I avoided them. At least the cashier was nice."
2003,That must have been uncomfortable?
2003,"Oh, I'm used to it so it was fine. Anyway, what do you do for a living?"
2003,I am retired I just spend the day with my cat Pickles.
2003,"That's a cute name, and I love cats! I teach 1st grade."
2003,How cool. My parents actually found this cat years ago. They met at Woodstock and found this cat a few days later.
2003,"That's a lovely story. Do you have any children of your own, and are you married?"
2003,I have one grown son and I'm single. How about yourself?
2003,I'm married to the man of my dreams. He was my high school sweetheart. We don't have any children yet.
2003,Aww that's so sweet! Good for you!
2003,Thank you! Also we have a dog named Abigail.
2003,Dogs are such a joy. What kind of dog is it?
2004,"I just got a new job cleaning gutters , its not glamours but it pays the bills"
2004,"Hey, gotta do what you gotta do....I like to go to the beach in my free time, you?"
2004,I like to ride my motorcycle around  and feel the breeze ya know what i mean
2004,That's pretty cool. nice. yes i do.
2004,its no harley but it gets the job done
2004,What kind do you have?
2004,a night hawk . what do you drive
2004,A chevrolet Avalanche. Have had it a while.
2004,those are pretty nice i thought about buying one once
2004,"Yeah it was 27,500 used. 2 years old."
2004,not bad at all seems like you got a good deal.
2004,I did but i had a bit high mileage for a 2 year old truck.
2005,Nice. I didn't know that!
2005,My dad was into the group so he told me all sorts of facts. How has your day been? 
2006,It's my friend's 70th birthday!  I'd say that's a big one!
2006,WOW!!! really BIG.
2006,"Definitely reason to celebrate!  I'm so happy for her, especially since she's still so healthy!"
2006,"good to hear, is it  surprise"
2006,"It's not a surprise party, but she doesn't know I'm coming, so that will surprise her!"
2006,oh! she will be surprised
2006,"Yes, especially since we live two states apart!"
2006,am so happy for you guys
2006,"She has a great sense of humor, so I'm making her a bouquet of dead flowers, thistles and spider webs..."
2006,hahahahahahahahah
2006,Plus I'll throw in some dead sticks for texture...LOL!
2006,she gonna love it
2007,I'll be going to the salon later. My hair is messed up now.
2007,"Same here. It's a long drive to work though, even longer back. Hopefully I can work it in!"
2007,You should! The one I go to is right next to where I get my Louis Vuittons.  I have to stay on trend.
2007,Cool! I could use a new bag myself.
2007,What salon do you use? I switched mine recently.
2007,Oh there's this really nice place down the street called Studio Mirage.
2007,Thats the place my sister in law goes to! She hates me tho.  I have no idea why.
2007,Aww that's no good. Well it's close to home and the service is pretty great! A little pricey though.
2007,you cant beat great service.
2007,Mhmm. What about you? What Salon did you switch to?
2007,"Hair Today, they're pricey too."
2007,Only the best right? Haha.
2007,you know it!
2008,Do you order things online?
2008,Yeah. I do that a lot! I only walk into stores to buy lame things like toilet paper.
2008,You can even get that online now!
2008,"Yeah but it is kinda awkward ordering T.P online, having it delivered. I mean I could just walk less than a mile, to a store to get it"
2008," In my area there is an app that lets you order everything you need and all you have to do is park, they load it into the trunk"
2008,Oh! Cool! Does it normally take this long or this is the first time waiting for your mail to be delivered?
2008,It usually only takes about an hour or so
2008,"Wow! If i have mails reaching me that fast, I will be on my phone querying the customer agent of the online store I bought from."
2008,Positive review for sure yes
2008,You just have to hang on a couple more days. No word about your mail and I think you reserve the right to cancel the order.
2008,Do you like coffee?
2008,"I prefer tea to coffee but yeah, I drink coffee."
2009,I do think it was real. That would be hard to fake.
2009,"I don't know. Maybe back then, but now it would be easy to fake with digital inventions. What's your favorite color?"
2009,"Probably Green. I am a meat eater, what about you?"
2009,I love red! And I love meat too! I could never be a vegetarian.Do you love veggies?
2009,I like some veggies but could also never be vegetarian. Give up bacon?? No way!
2009,"I hear ya! Bacon is SOOOO good! I tried to be a vegetarian once, didn't take. I like some, but not enough for that."
2009,Could you ever hunt for you own meat?
2009,Yes if I had to. We have tons of rabbits and deer here. What about you? Are you a hunter?
2009,Yes I am a hunter. Mainly deer. Makes a good chili!
2009,"That's awesome. I tried venison, wasn't very good, but maybe it was just the cook.Lol. I love chili! Now I'm hungry!"
2009,Thankfully I just ate. Are you big into conspiracy theories?
2009,"Not me, I need an afternoon snack. Yes, love conspiracy therories! What's your best theory?"
2010,Where have people helped you out before by doing something nice?
2010,Speaking of giving back...have you heard of Idol Gives Back? I guess it was a charitable campaign on American Idol in the 6th season...
2010,I haven't heard of it. I've been travelling for about a year now.
2010,That's nice. I travel a lot for my job.
2010,Where do you travel to normally?
2010,"Anywhere there are computers. But I like when they send me to places of interest , good places to eat and things like that ."
2010,There are wonderful places to eat in Japan. I love the food in Kyoto particularly.
2010,"oh , i have been to tokyo once ."
2010,I'm there now! What did you think of it?
2010,It was nice! I would love to go back and take my best friend with me.
2010,You should definitely visit the Tokyo Dome
2010,I will need to check it out!
2011,There is a photo in my wallet.
2011,"Of Bieber? Wow, you must be very into him! I may or may not have a picture of the Flash in my room - I understand hero worship."
2011,"No, it's not a picture of Justin. Haha, you like The Flash? The picture in my wallet is of me at my senior prom. "
2011,Okay that makes a lot more sense. Yes - The Flash is my favorite hero!
2011,I waited in line at the supermarket for a while today. It was horrible. I had to wait 40 minutes to get my shopping. What's your favorite store? 
2011,I love online shopping. Mostly poshmark for fashion items. I tend to type one handed because I'm browsing on my phone.
2011,I use poshmark. It helps me avoid long lines. Where are you from>
2011,I'm from Minnesota. Our weather is starting to turn cold so I'm happy to stay inside and shop. What about you?
2011,I'm from Ireland. I like to surf. 
2011,"Jealous! I've only seen pictures of Ireland, but I'd love to visit!"
2011,"Yes. There is lots to do here. However, we are concerned about Brexit. Are you aware of the situation?"
2011,"No, please inform me."
2011,"Brexit is a shortened version of 'Britain's exit"" for the European Union. In 2016, the British people voted and the result was that Britain would leave the EU. "
2012,"Which one, about my children are a disappointment(oh so true!) or I am bored of my maids?"
2012,"No about your wife being a former miss usa. I'm a local tv celeb myself, I have been featured 6 times in the new now."
2012,"Oh, yea, sorry. Brain toot. She was a former Miss USA about 8 years ago. Unfortunately my kids were mad because they really didn't want her to participate."
2012,Nice. Did she have to travel oversees a lot for promotions?
2012,"Being Miss USA, she travelled mostly arount the United States to all 50+ states. She also had to represent the U.S. to all 267 countries except Iraq and North Korea."
2012,I myself have been overseas many times. But that amount of traveling must have been very exhausting.
2012,"Yes, and the worst part was that all 16 of my children were upset everyday she was gone because no one would do the laundry"
2012,Wait what? You have 16 kids? That's insane!
2012,"My wife is very fertile. Every time we had a child, she would have another. Plus we had sextuplets one time. and quintuplets another."
2012,Did she have sextuplets before she won miss USA or after?
2012,"Oh, it was definitely before. We actually weren't married before our first 4 babies, so she was able to be MISS America and not Mrs. America. ;)"
2012,"Haha that's smart, you never know. Well good luck, here's to a wonderful life together for you two!"
2013,Me too!!!! My car looks pretty good! Have  you done any diy projects recently?
2013,"Not yet,though I'm a car enthusiasts"
2013,I'm not really into cars. I love airplanes. I think it has to do with the fact that my dad is a pilot. 
2013,That is so admirable of you. Do you want to be like your dad and pilot someday?
2013,"No, I don't like flying. I just like watching them. "
2013,I didn't see that coming hahaha and why not? if it is not very intrusive of me to know.
2013,LOL! I'm scared of flying. lol. Do you like to fly?
2013,lol ok i understand. I love seeing the clouds from above and the excitement of going to a new place.
2013,Do you travel a lot?
2013, I fly a few times per year. Sometimes to visit family and others on vacation.
2013,That sounds nice. I wish I wasn't scared to fly
2013,I hope that one day you will overcome that fear and enjoy traveling more.
2014,That's a shame. I remember having a blast with my brothers there when we were kids
2014,"Which one, California or Florida?"
2014,"Florida of course! Like most grandparents, my granny moved there after grandpa passed away. That's how I got into Agatha Christie you know, reading her collection"
2014,"I see. I am in Florida myself, working on my law degree. Where are you from?"
2014,Boston. Both my brothers are in law now. I'm responsible coz I told them many stories about murder and crime that I learnt from novels. 
2014,Seems you are a big fan of those books! It's a lot harder than I expected!!
2014,Am I!? Yeah.. How did you decide to study law? 
2014,"My dad wanted me to be a lawyer, since he's one. I said no way.. but he insisted.. and paid my tuition"
2014,"Oh boy.. tuition for law school, that's ought to be a lot of money. One of my brothers is still paying his school debt. The other is cooperate lawyer, so."
2014,"The money is great, but it is hard work and less glamorous than on TV"
2014,"Well, you can always buy other kinds of glamour with all that money "
2014,One day maybe I'll pay my sons tuition!
2015,"I'm working on it, but its hard without help from parents or siblings."
2015,Do you receive any support from an educational institution with regards to help with applications and interviews?  
2015,I've been exploring some options. It looks like I can set up a meeting with a counselor at the local college.
2015,Do you already meet minimum entry requirements?
2015,"I'll have a few more classes to take, but I'm close!"
2015,What kind of classes have you taken?
2015,"Oh god, everything. All the generals, chemistry, biology, anatomy, you name it. "
2015,Do you study mathematics or physics? 
2015,"Absolutely, but enough about studies. How has your day been?"
2015,Great. I'm an accountant and I recently got promoted. 
2015,"Hey, congratulations!!!! I could probably use one of you once I'm making money haha"
2015,Cheeky. Thank you. 
2016,I already have 4 big Labradors who I love like my children. 
2016,I think my favorite thing about labradors is how smart they are. They're often used as a disability assistance breed all over the world!
2016,Yes they are really great for that. One of mine is an aid dog for my son.
2016,"You have a son thats cool. I have two sons, both in high school. How old is your son?"
2016,I have a 9 year old son. I'm still a learning lol. I'm sure high school will be a whole new learning process when I get there. 
2016,"Yeah it's definitely tough work, but it is very rewarding seeing them grow up"
2016,It sure is. I know they say it gets easier but the parenting never really stops.
2016,"Yes, i just hope im a good parent to my son! what else do you do besides work"
2016, I like to volunteer at the local schools a few times a week. How about yourself?
2016,i am retired so spend most of my days with my husband and helping at a local shelter
2016,How neat! I rarely meet other people who volunteer as well!
2016,Yep some people say they are to busy to but we always find time
2017,Yeah! My grandparents are really cheering me on
2017,"I like to cook, but I couldn't do it as a job."
2017,Why not?
2017,Its fun and personal for me. I don't want to have to please strangers.
2017,What kind of food do you like to cook?
2017,"Steak, soups and Mexican food."
2017,Are you Hispanic?
2017,Yes. Mexican American.
2017,"Ah. I only ask because my very, very white dad only cooks Mexican food."
2017,I'm personally thinking of a medical career. I work in a hospital.
2017,Oh really? What kind of medical career?
2017,"Well, not a doctor yet, but I would like to go into assiting or nursing."
2018,I used to be able to run fast but not anymore. My favorite sport to play is soccer.
2018,Soccer is a fun sport to play. It would be good for you to do something you love also. I too can no longer run fast
2018,Sorry to hear about the arthritis. Did you have to go to physical therapy for it?
2018,Yes I did! It was hard work but it helped.
2018,That's good. My wife is a physical therapist. What type of work are you into?
2018,I'm a dancer. What type of work are you into?
2018,In the computer industry. So I sit in a chair all day. Boring but it pays the bills. 
2018,I see! Do you work on games? or software?
2018,I wish. I enjoy playing games. Mainly break/fix stuff. How is dancing after the arthritis?
2018,It's not as easy as it used to be. I practice daily. Lots of physical therapy and stretching and training. What kind of games do you play?
2018,I play destiny on the ps4 but not as much now with kids and family.
2018,I understand the time constraints. I too have kids and family. i have never really played the destiny series is it fun ?
2019,i am working in finance company
2019,"That's cool. I could use a finance adviser in my life, honestly. Do you think you can work independently?"
2019,yes i want to work independently

2020,You should visit Miami.  I believe you would have a great time.
2020,I love Miami! Do you?
2020,I absolutely love Miami.  I can't imagine living anywhere else!
2020,One day i might move to miami
2020,You should move here!  I'm sure you would love it just as I do!
2020,Im glad you think we should be roomates
2020,We probably would make good roommates. What are you into as far as hobbies? I like to go to the beach here. It's so beautiful.
2020,Miami is a great hobby!
2020,I am a young guy so I'm still in great shape.  I love to run!
2020,I love great shapes! Circle is my favorite!
2020,I like circles as well.  It's like the circle of life.  People and nature are connected.  We make this world what it is.
2021,"Of course, I am feeling on top of the world! Some thoughts creep in my head sometimes though."
2021,"It's such a great time for you! It can be scary too though, for sure."
2021,"Yeah, I really want to tow the line of my passion but my father wants me to help run his business. "
2021,That sounds like a bit of a conundrum. I'd love to run my own business; I dream of opening a restaurant at some point.
2021,I meant 'toe' and that's beautiful what you dream of. I love painting but my dad sees it as a waste of my time.
2021,Creating things is so exciting. Coming up with new recipes is where I indulge creativity. I imagine it's difficult that your dad sees painting as a waste of your time.
2021,"Yeah, it is. One time he walked into my room and he compared me to a nine year old experimenting half chewed crayons. "
2021,That must've hurt. It sounds as though you're still able to find a way to enjoy your passion sometimes despite the criticism from your dad.
2021,definitely. I hope you really own a restaurant someday.
2021,Thank you so much. I hope you get to pursue your dream of painting and wish you the best of luck for the rest of your senior year.
2021,yes.
2021,You've got this. Good luck!
2022,I love chocolate too. Dark chocolate is my favorite. I like truffles. 
2022,I love truffles. mostly in my free time i like to play soccer.
2022,I don't play too many sports. My hobby is growing my flower garden. Does Hershey make a truffle? I don't think I've ever seen one. 
2022,Not that i know of...Gardens are cool. I plant one in the spring now and then.
2022,Is it for flowers or for vegetables? I would grow vegetables but I know it would just feed the raccoons around here. 
2022,Vegetables....Mostly Cheyenne peppers and okra. what kind of garden you grow?
2022,"It's mostly smaller flowers and some bushes. I am waiting for my blooming trees to grow, but that takes much longer than the small flowers in my garden. "
2022,"Oh okay, well that seems nice. Probably stress releasing."
2022,There is nothing more relaxing than napping by an open window on a warm day with Grand Flora Magnolias in bloom. Truly intoxicating. 
2022,"that made me smile, real humanity....tranquil"
2022,I can't wait for them to grow. For now I will just have to settle on my lovely little flowers. 
2022,Yes :) they will get there if taken care of properly....
2022,I hope so. It is one irreplaceable joy of living in the South. 
2022,nice chat :) take care
2022,You too. 
2022,im in the south lol
2022,"It's beautiful. I guess many do not appreciate it so much, but all places have their special qualities. Do you like the South?"
2022,"yes, in most ways. The peach state has some good things about it ;)"
2022,That is where I was born. I must admit it is my favorite place. I miss it. 
2022,"wow cool....yes it has nice scenery. i better go, mines about to expire. Scottyc2112@yahoo"
2022,"Okay, have a good day! ;)"
2022,;)
2023,"Wow, that's awesome - congratulations!"
2023,Thank you. I also got a business degree. Marketing was what I enjoyed most.
2023,Seems like a lot of credits!  I've always loved science.  Any idea what you'll do next?
2023,Im going to study Finance. It just goes to show that if you put your mind to it you can achieve anything.
2023,"Yes, that's definitely true.  Why does Finance interest you?"
2023,Money makes the world go round! These are important topics.
2023,"My mom is a financial planner.  After her battle with cancer, she found her new passion."
2023,I'm so glad she made it through! Cancer is a terrible disease.
2023,It's way too common.  I'm hoping to use my science background to help find a cure.
2023,That's a very noble pursuit! My aunt battled skin cancer. Unfortunately my family lives across the country from me.
2023,"Thank you.  I hope your aunt made it through as well.  We also live far from family, and it's tough to miss out on so many things."
2023,"Yes, family is very important. And my aunt is fine now, thank you!"
2024,Interesting. I wonder where they make them now?
2024,I think everywhere. They sure seem to be everywhere. I got a pretty beat up one for my 21st birthday this year.
2024,I hope you had a great 21st birthday! It is always one of the most fun.
2024,"It was a blast! The car was much appreciated, but the best gift was my tiny little kitten. She's a doll."
2024,I have two kittens as well! They are growing so fast.
2024,Omg cuuuuuuuuute! How old are they?
2024,I think about 6 months. They were found abandoned so I don
2024,That's very cool of you to take them in. Did you get them from a rescue?
2024,"No, found outside one of my siblings workshops. "
2024,Awww then they were destined for you!
2024,I like to think so. They are named after hockey players.
2024,Oh you must like hockey then. Where are you from?
2025,Woah! Airplanes!!  That's awesome. Do you like travelling? 
2025,"Yes, I like to travel to distant geographical locations by train."
2025,Train? nice. I prefer planes. Quick and accessible. 
2025,"Agreed, travelling by airplane is a lot faster and more convenient than travel by car."
2025,or train? lol  you been to bora bora?  where do you live? Beach is really close from where I live. 
2025,"Yes, last month I went to to Panama City,Florida."
2025,cool. How was it? I have been to Miami once and Orlando a couple of times. But that's about it. 
2025,It was awesome. I live in SE Georgia so Florida is an easy trip.
2025,yeah.  My job requires me to travel a lot. So its mostly business trips but i do get weekends off. 
2025,"nice ! thankfully , i work four days during the summer . three day weekends rock ."
2025,that's cool!! Where do you work? 
2025,I work at a bank in a small town.
2026,"Well, I drink 10 cups a day! "
2026,That is great. What kind of tea do you like?
2026,Green tea and Earl Grey. 
2026,"That sounds good, I like to drink matcha green tea. This is my favorite, especially after I got my new lob. It is my ritual now. "
2026,A new job! Congrats!
2026,My new job is selling cars. Can not wait for my first day tomorrow. 
2026,"Have you ever found snakes in the cars you sell? I'm deathly afraid of snakes, bugs are fine though."
2026,Defiantly no. But to be honest I will be curious to look now. What do you do for a living?
2026,"I'm an accountant. Boring maths, but it's certainly my gift. What about you? "
2026,Car enthusiast. Starting my first day tomorrow at the dealership. 
2026,Interesting. How did you get into that?
2026,I was watching my dad fix cars for 20 years now. This is my dream job since childhood. 
2027,"Yes, that always works well for a party! What's your favorite color? I like bright sunshine yellows.  "
2027,I love country music!  My favorite artist is Garth Brooks.  I like maroon because that was my college's school color.
2027,I like Garth Brooks too. :)  Friends in Low Places is my favorite song. What kind of movies do you like? 
2027,I love Syfy movies as well as superhero movies.
2027,"Cool! I'm a fan of scifi films, and paranormal/ghost stories are fascinating. I haven't seen many superhero films. What would you recommend? "
2027,My dad loved the Iron Man movies!  My dad and I are very close.  I sometimes would visit him when he used to work for Home Depot.
2027,"Aw, that's awesome. I'm very close to my dad too. He helps me out with DIY projects and we watch Star Trek together. "
2027,I don't care much for Star Trek but I love Star Wars!
2027,I've only seen the original Star Wars Trilogy. Do you like the prequels and new films too? 
2027,I only like the original trilogy as well.  They prequels are alright.  The new films are terrible.
2027,I'll skip then then. I do have a special place in my heart for the original films. Do you like the Firefly TV series? 
2027,I loved Firefly! That was an amazing sfy show!  I hate that it got cancelled.
2028,thats why i like to swim i am pretty buoyant.
2028,Well buoyancy can change on basis of both body composition and the salinity of the water.
2028,that is very true.how long have you been swimming?
2028,6 years
2028,i have been swimming for about 15 years. i like to swim in the ocean.
2028,I've never been much for sea stuff for some reason.
2028,yeah i understand that. i have just found that the beach can offer a really awesome workout while being in a great environment. 
2028,i just like the energy of being at the beach . not the water lol
2028,"i used to have a job by the beach, it was a pretty cool energy."
2028,it most definitely is . it gets rid of all the stress .
2028,i love the sounds of the beach
2028,it is nice to be at the beach and just enjoy the sound and water .
2028,the wind is nice too. its also really fun to fly kites on the beach. 
2028,"I'm glad we can agree on so many things. but I have to go, we'll talk later."
2028,yeah definitely. you take care. have a good day!
2029,I feel so stressed about it. I think I'll go back now and pay for it so I can relax about it.
2029,That's very moral of you. Everyone makes mistakes.
2029,"Yeah, that's true, but I just feel it's something I can fix pretty easily and it'll make me feel so much better. I hate feeling stressed."
2029,"Yes, I know what you mean. There's enough stress in life as it is!"
2029,For sure. What are some ways you destress? I enjoy candlelight and the sound of rain on rainy days.
2029,I like to spend quality time with my husband and 3 children. But sometimes they are the cause of the stress! lol
2029,"That's great. Hahahaha! I can imagine, but more fun times than stressful times by the sound of it."
2029,"Yes, no doubt. I love them. Do you have any children?"
2029,I have 3 children also. Family time is so special.
2029,"That's great. Yes, I think family and friends are the most important things in life."
2029,Agreed. I enjoyed chatting with you today. Thanks for listening to my woes of forgetting to pay for my drink.
2029,This was the best chat I've had today. Enjoy your day!
2030,Is there any reason why you don't have children?
2030,I just haven't found the right person yet.  Do you have children?
2030,Yes I have 2 children but they are grown. My son still lives with my husband and I.
2030,That seems nice that he's still close-by. 
2030,Maybe! He works 2nd shift so he's not home much but he's a slob. He likes for me to cook. I charge him to wash his clothes.
2030,"Ugh, so sorry!  Nevermind, maybe I don't want kids then. "
2030,ts OK. I try to teach him to cook on his own. My mother taught me to cook and now I own a restaurant. 
2030,"That's a great skill to have!  I love chatting with people I don't know, usually on the subway, but a restaurant may be a great spot too."
2030,"Free WIFI! So, yes! If you like home cooking..."
2030,Even better!  What are your signature dishes?
2030,"Fried chicken, mac/cheese, apple cobbler"
2030,Sounds delicious - I'm ready to eat now!
2031,Thank goodness no. I think it's time to relocate somewhere tropical.
2031,Where did this take place?
2031,I had a farm in Minnesota. You can never win against the might Mississippi.
2031,"I live along the Gulf Coast. We have a different kind of storm here, hurricanes."
2031,That must be scary. Has it been a busy season?
2031,"For me, there has been no problem. But a few years ago, almost got flooded."
2031,"I'm glad to hear that. Flooing happens everywhere, I think I will take my chances while around palm trees."
2031,"I can't imagine living in a cold climate, but I keep mostly to home."
2031,I will miss the change of seasons.
2031,"We only have hot, not so hot and a little chilly where I live."
2031,The beach has to be nice to live by. 
2031,Its a mile away. It loses its novelty over time.
2032,I'm 300 pounds too! We should run a marathon together!
2032,That would be ideal!I know I love soda and candy but I would stop if I committed to this run.
2032,I also enjoy basketball
2032,I enjoy watching basketball. The only other sport I've ever played is softball.
2032,Did you enjoy softball?
2032,I did enjoy it. It was just enough exercise to not pass out!
2032,I used to pass out all the time!
2032,Hahaha me too. I have thrown up on a track during a boot camp I signed up for a while back.
2032,I love throwing up!
2032,I have found it helps to catch your second wind while exercising!
2032,Exercising is important!
2032,Yes. I need to do it more instead of eating candy and drinking soda!
2033,"Absolutely! A lot can be conveyed through music and poetry. I wish I was musical, but I don't have the talent."
2033,I don't really have any musical talent either. I always want to learn to play the drums
2033,"My brothers play the drums, which is... annoying. But, you know, family comes first and it makes them happy."
2033,"Haha! Yeah, I'm sure the drums isn't the best musical choice for keeping the peace in the family. How many brothers do you have?"
2033,Just two. I had a 3rd but he passed during a bad car accident. We were all near death but he was the only one who didn't make it.
2033,"Oh my gosh, I am so sorry."
2033,"I know, thank you. In a weird way it brought us all closer."
2033,It's nice that you've been able to see the positive that comes from such a devastating experience. I can see how that would bring you all closer together.
2033,Its really the only way to move on with life. We've realized we need to appreciate each other more.
2033,I get that completely. Did all three of your brothers play the drums?
2033,Yep! Its always been loud around here haha
2033,"Makes you appreciate the quiet more when it happens, I'm sure :) "
2034,"She was ok, thankfully."
2034,Sometimes laughter is the best medicine
2034,It is.  My cat always makes me laugh. His name is Leroy Jenkins. haha.
2034,That is a great name for a cat! I have two cats named Spoof and Fluttershy
2034,Those are awesome names!! 
2034,"They make me laugh all the time, but I also enjoy when they cuddle and comfort me"
2034,"yes, cants are great cuddlers when they want to be. I wish I could have a real dragon as a pet."
2034,"I would love to have a fantastical creature as a pet. I think I would pick a unicorn or a pegasus, but dragons are cool too"
2034,Unicorns would probably be better cuddlers than dragons lol
2034,"haha, yeah. I think any pet you could ride would be great though"
2034,I agree. Are your cats the only pets you have?
2034,"My current residence only allows up to two pets, so yes. But I wish I could have more! What about you?"
2035,"Oh, what part of Canada are you from. Or is that were you just go hunting?"
2035,"I'm from a small place just outside Montreal island in Quebec, and like a good Quebecois I'm holidaying in France this christmas "
2035,"Nice, I've been to Quebec, it is so beautiful. When I went it was winter time. Not one day did I ever see the ground. Always snow."
2035,Yep! That sounds like Quebec in the winter. But it's ok. much better for dogs you know. All that snow makes them so happy. Do you have a canine friend
2035,"At this moment, I don't, but my brother just got one. When I see his pup, she is no adorable. I want one myself! Wife's scared of them though."
2035,"I was sceptical, but my partner insisted. Oh boy he was right! We started by fostering, and I now love them, especially black labradors. Makes it hard travelling."
2035,"I can understand. Speaking about labradors, my brothers wifes sister had one. Golden color. So beautiful. Died about 2 years from birth from a heart condition:("
2035,"Oh no.. that's so sad. It must have been devastating. It sounds like you have a big famil, and often bigger the family, greater the number of dogs."
2035,"Here's the thing. When Shelly(my brothers, wifes...) got the dog from a shelter, she already new about the heart condition. Just a matter of time."
2035,"I find what Shelly did to be honorable to be honest. She didn't abandon the dog, and probably made him happy before he passed."
2035,Yes. Your right! I'm trying to figure out what I should have for dinner. I'm a Vegan. Have any ideas?
2035,"A vegan! I salute you my friend. I'm vegaterian because I can't do without yogurt.. Anyway, I suggest fallafels for dinner, with a nice salad."
2036,She is pretty happy about being playing softball
2036,"I've seen some fastpitch softball on TV played by women, and that rotating pitch is crazy looking.  Did they throw it like that when you played growing up?"
2036,No i only really played for a little bit. I wanted to get her into softball because i watched a youtube video of Jenna Marbles
2037,I did not know about that. What is your favorite?
2037,"That's hard to say, I love them all. What is your favorite type of music?"
2037,Hmm.. they are all good. But maybe pop. 
2037,"I like that too. On top of death metal, I like listening to Blake Shelton. "
2037,"What do you think about AC DC, good for car driving "
2037,YES!!!! That's a loud radio-windows down kind of band. 
2037,To go crazy !!
2037,"Yes, but for the older bands I'd have to say my favorite is Pink Floyd. "
2037,"Do you play any instrument, maybe guitar? "
2037,I wish. I just sing. Do you?
2037,Too embarrassing I played flute in high school. But love to sing.
2037,"I sang all throughout school, starting in Elm, but now I just sing in the car. lol"
2038,"No, much like South Park, there's only one Asian place in town. "
2038,"oh nice, im afraid the most asian food that i like is fortune cookies"
2038,Fortune cookies never really tell you a fortune anymore. They are more like statements.
2038,"Honestly,thats very true"
2038,"I bought tickets for my favorite band, Avenged Sevenfold, today. I'm super exicted."
2038,I have never heard of Avenged Sevenfold.  What kind of music is that
2038,They are a hard rock/metal band.
2038,They sound rock metal. Hope you have a great time!
2038,"Thank you, I apprecite that! You really don't like Asian food?"
2038,"Definitely Chinese but they've got some American fare, too."
2038,What is your favorite American cuisine?
2038,pizza
2039,Now I just play video games in my spare time.
2039,"i still live with my parents, so i have alot of time for playing games"

2039,i work at a fastfood restraunt
2039,My son's first job was at a fast food restaurant

2039,It's definately good honest work. Do you get free food?
2039,only on lunch time
2039,Do you do the grill?
2039,"no, i work the window"
2039,I bet you deal with a lot of mean people that give you a hard time.
2039,"sometimes, but work is work."
2040,That is a fascinating hobby! Where are you from? I'm from Baton Rouge and there aren't mountains here! 
2040,I am actually from Wales. I started climbing with the Scouts as a kid. It is believe it or not a really relaxing thing to do.
2040,Did you become an Eagle Scout? I did sailing when I was in scouts but that was many years ago. 
2040,"Yes, I made it to Eagle scout. I've done sailing too - I like anything outdoors. It gets me away from my horrible driving job."
2040,I feel the same. I'm stuck in an office all week so it's great to get some sun on the weekend. Do you play any sports? 
2040,"Aside from walking and the odd kick about with the soccer ball, nothing organised. I just don't have the time. "
2040,I just picked up with a casual softball league that's great. It's a first for me. Do you listen to audiobooks on the road? 
2040,"My car doesn't have the gear for audiobooks, but my wife's car does, and I like to listen to autobiographies. Where do you work by the way?"
2040,"At a travel agency. We're very busy in the spring and summer, but less so when it gets cold. Do you have to drive in the snow? "
2040,I just put the winter tires on and I'll be driving in snow in a few weeks! Where do people want to travel the most to?
2040,"We book a lot of cruises, but Barcelona have been very popular lately. I'd like too  see Iceland someday. Do you travel much? "
2040,"I travelled more when flights were cheaper, not so much now. I went Barcelona as a teenager. "
2041,do they eat french fries on that day?
2041,"not usually, I wish they would though. Whats your favorite food"
2041,"french fries, of course. what is yours?"
2041,I'd probably have to say pizza. Do you like pizza?
2041,"yeah, i just hate smelling like it though. what do you think about pineapple on it?"
2041,I am adamantly opposed to pineapple on pizza
2041,"me too, so do you have a specific trade?"
2041,I work in the service department. you?
2041,"i work as an english teacher, i find science and math hard."
2041,I am more of a math guy myself. its consistent across all languages
2041,that reminds me of mean girls....great movie.
2041,"ha. yes, amazing movie, and for sure the inspiration of where i got it from"
2042,there is a harbor nearby. it is fun to go out on the boat with friends
2042,That's awesome! Spending the weekend with friends doing something you love sounds so relaxing and fun.
2042,yeah it's a great way to unwind. work can be so stressful. what do you do for a living?
2042,"I agree. I'm a nurse so I get the stress factor. How about you, what do you do?"
2042,that's great. nurses help a lot of people. i work as a contractor for a taxi company
2042,"You must meet lots of interesting people. I love my job, but I spend a lot of time at the hospital right now since my mother is in hospital."
2042,"oh no, i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she recovers quickly"
2042,Thank you. I hope so too. I imagine in your job you come across all types of people.
2042,oh i guess so. my job is not that interesting to be honest! the most exciting thing in my life is that i just got engaged
2042,That's super exciting. Congratulations! Have you decided when and where you'll get married?
2042,not yet. there are so many things to plan for a wedding it is overwhelming!
2042,Definitely! But so much fun too. I hope it all goes well and wish you lots of luck for your future.
2043,My favorite is the Kalamata olive hummus from Trader Joes. You have to like olives though because they are featured prominently :)
2043,Thats my favorite! I love humus on pita bread .
2043,Definitely! That's a great snack (or meal).
2043,"I like Pita bread, it's easy to make at home."
2043,I've never tried to make it. Is it easier than baking loaf bread?
2043,It's actually pretty straight forward when you know how. It's a good skill to have as it means you can make something from very cheap ingredients.
2043,"Right, that makes sense. There's a Mediterranean restaurant close to my work. They have delicious pita -- especially when it's warm, fresh out of the oven"
2043,Oh I love those. They always have great selections and the desserts aren't bad either.
2043,Agreed. Have you ever been to Greece? I went a few years back and had the most amazing food
2043,yes . it was great . lots of tours through athens and the islands . food was wonderful .
2043,Right? So delicious. And the country was so beautiful too!
2043,Absolutely. It also has more World Heritage sites than any other country in the world. So much to explore there.
2044,"Last October, we were high school sweethearts - I still find it hard to believe it happened and have to pinch myself some days "
2044,That's so cute!!! I am glad for you
2044,"Thanks, it took some work - I grew up in the Army and to move around a lot so lot's of long distance. Do you have a partner right now?"
2044,"Not at the moment, maybe one day"
2044,"Oh i'm sorry, are you working on that? I hear Tinder can be plenty fun these days"
2044,"Tinder is okay, but it can also be a problem"
2044,"How so? It's weird i've never had to use it myself, just seen it on friends phone"
2044,I don't like Tinder because it can be a shallow place
2045,"yes i have one daughter shes 12, how old are your kids?"
2045,"Mine are 4,5 and 11. They are a handful!"
2045,"sounds like a lot of fun, i am happy my child is finally eating whatever i serve her, took forever, her being a picky eater still gives me nightmares"
2045,I sympathise. Mine just started eating what I serve as well. I find myself jumping for joy as if I had 3 Ferraris!
2045,"lol!! too funny, being a vegetarian has also helped a bit, i think? are you a vegetarian?"
2045,I'm actually vegan. My kids ended up liking my began food as well and it has been easier. 
2045,"thats awesome, do you find hard to find places that are vegan/vegetarian?"
2045,Yes. I find it easier to make my own food now. I don't really go out to eat much. How is your experience?
2045,"same, i  am wondering if opening a restaurant catering to vegan/vegetarian would be a hit? i am starting a new juicing bar though, do you juice?"
2045,I would say the restaurant would be a hit. I don't juice but I have heard nothing but great things about it.
2045,"a really good friend of mine juices and she has mentioned the energy increased, which is something i really need "
2045,I will have to look into that. I need an energy boost myself!
2046,how does your mom like her job in telecommunications?
2046,It's mostly phone support so it's the most enjoyable thing in the world
2046,well at least she likes it. i am not too excited about telecommunications as a side job
2046,"Yeah, I feel you on that, it's good to find something you can enjoy."
2046,"i might not be able to afford to live by myself, but i am sure i will figure it out."
2046,I can relate to that. Is there any specific job you've looked into short term?
2046,i actually got a call for more information to work selling running shoes. witch is awesome because i love to run.
2046,That's awesome. Do you have any specific brands that you like?
2047,i threatened him and we went outside
2047,thats crazy! so did you fight?
2047,"yes, i hurt him pretty bad."
2047,"wow, i could only imagine how the ride home after was."
2047,"it wasn't that big of a deal, i can squat 400 pounds, so it was easy."
2047,"wow, and i thought my job as a babysitter was cool. you definetely win in that catagory."
2047,how many kids do you babysit?
2047,"3, they're my neighbors kids."
2047,how old?
2047,all under 10 - 8 year old twins and a 6 year old.
2047,is it hard?
2047,"a little bit, the bus is my only mode of transportation, but i make it work."
2048,"It's a local one, just me and a couple other people work there."
2048,that's cool
2048,Thanks. Do you get a chance to go to museums often?
2048,I work at a museum 2
2048,"Oh cool, what do you specialise in?"
2048,art and design nothing fancy
2048,That does sound fancy. How long have you worked there?
2048,9 years
2048,What do you do when you are not working at the museum>?
2048,I love to read. You?
2048,I like to try new craft beers at the local breweries.
2048,"Beer is good, I don't care much for the newer ones that are flavored with fruits or herbs though"
2049,"Wow, you learn something new everyday. "
2049,Yes you do! It's a big deal around here in Kentucky.
2049,Maybe I should drive up and check it out once my car is fixed. I have never been there. 
2049,I hope you get your car fixed soon. A trip to the Bluegrass state is always a good time.
2049,"Thank you, I think it is leaking water because it keeps over heating. A road trip sounds nice right about now. "
2049,Are you handy with cars or do you use a mechanic?
2049,"I have to use a mechanic. I know nothing about cars, except how to drive them. lol "
2049,I am not good with my hands either. I like to do things like read.
2049,two peas in a pod!! What is your favorite genre? I love horror and suspense. 
2049,I love them all! My favorite book is Enders Game. How about you?
2049,"My favorite, that I couldn't put down.. A Boy Called It. based on real events but still scary"
2049,I love books based on real events.
2049,You should check it out. 
2050,"As much as I love burgers, I couldn't do it. I reach my max with triple burgers. It's bad for me though."
2050,I could NEVER eat that many burgers even if I wanted to. Why did you eat so many burgers?
2050,I get cravings and I don't eat for the entire day so I can binge. I have stopped drinking cola with them I hope that is more healthy. 
2050,Are you doing Keto? if you aren't we are cheating on your diet tonight! No more salads for me!
2050,I have done some research into Keto and I think you really need to know what to do. It can be dangerous I think. no Salads! Hurrah!
2050,"Oh, ok. Same here. I tried it for a few days and it made me sick. But I love my salads, so I'm ok."
2050,"I tend to stay up late writing, so my diet isn't healthy. What about you?"
2050,It should be healthier. I love to camp and hike. But I'll bring doritos instead of fruit too often. :)
2050,"It is just so easy to get junk food. It's everywhere and you have to focus on healthy stuff. I bring chocolate on hikes. bad, I know!"
2050,It really is. And cheaper! What else do you like to do other than write and hike?
2050,I work part time in a call centre selling stationery and for fun I play darts. 
2050,That's awesome. I wish I knew more about darts. I'm no good. 
2051,I am feeling so emotional because I have a bad past.
2051,"oh no, do you wanna talk about it?"
2051,My father and mother got separated when I was 5 years old.
2051,"im sorry to hear that, im sure thats hard."
2051,Yes. My mother is a strong woman.
2051,"mine too, i love her so much."
2051,Where do you work?
2051,"at a sable, i train horses."
2051,That's cool. I love horse riding.
2051,"me too, i ride them as much as i can."
2051,It is your full time job?
2051,"yes , it is . i quite enjoy it ."
2052,It seems as though an action like that would impede traffic but it is a sweet gesture
2052,I just hope I can teach my children to show such empathy with others.
2052,I'm sure you will be able to. Having a kind and empathetic influence on a child does a whole lot of good!
2052,I agree. If more people were compassionate like that then maybe the world wouldn't be as messed up.
2052,Definitely. I hope humanity as a whole can become better and less violent in the coming years
2052,It is hard since there are so few good public examples of courtesy and respect.  I think it is up to us parents to show a good example.
2052,I agree. Being a kind person starts in the home
2052,Do you have a children also?
2052,"I do not, just a cat. I did not have the best parents, myself."
2052,"I am sorry to hear that.  We have dogs, but i used to have cats as a child."
2052,I love dogs! Kind of high energy but they're very cute and loving
2052,Absolutely.  Good companions and calming too.
2052,It was nice chatting with you!
2053,"No, I am not very good at swimming, either."
2053,I don't know how to swim. 
2053,That's unfortunate. Do you want to learn?
2053,I have always wanted to. When I went to camp I always avoided the water activities.
2053,"That's a good place to learn. I like to swim, but I am not great"
2053,What do you do during the day? I just started a job working for the library.
2053,I work and then make music
2053,What instrument do you play or is it computer generated?
2053,I produce music (computer-generated) and also play piano!
2053,I used to play piano when I was a child. My mom even bought be a really nice one.
2053,I really like it. It can teach you a lot about things.
2053,I probably couldn't play now as it has been so many years and forgot alot of the keys and how to read the sheet.
2053,It's a very complex instrument
2054,I have never heard of the Avett Brother. Have you?
2054,I am familiar with them ha have you heard High Steppin' maybe?
2054,Nope. I'm a senior citizen. But I know who The Beatles are! lol
2054,oh yes the beatles are the best of the bes
2054,My favorite is the Bee Gees though. Have you heard of them?
2054,You know I have!  Stayin Alive is my theme song at the garage!  Haha!
2054,Very Cool! My fav is Fanny. How old are you?
2054,i'm older than you . . . guess !
2054,WOW! I'm 69. Are you 72?
2054,"71 . a little older than you, retirement is near I pray hahaha"
2054,"I retired at 61, too soon, no money left. Is why I work now LOL."
2054,"I was too afraid to retire on time because I have expensive tastes and expensive cars to upkeep, it's a pity really..."
2054,Good luck!
2054,You too! Thanks!
2055,I work at an animal shelter. I've adopted three dogs from there. Do you have any pets? 
2055,"I have three wonderful cats that were all feral rescues. I love to play baseball, though I'm not good at all."
2055,"I enjoyed playing baseball when i was a teenager, but after a shoulder injury I mostly read and hang out with the senior dogs. "
2055,"I actually injured my back a while back as well. I haven't gone to the doctor yet, though! Reading and hanging out with pups are great!"
2055,I wish you a speedy recovery and I hope the doctor can help. What was it like rescuing cats that were feral? 
2055,"It took a ton of patience because they didn't trust anyone. They still dislike everyone, but, me. Two love me and one tolerates me."
2055,"Aw, you're a good person! One of my dogs was previously mistreated and he is still warming up to home life. It's a lot of work but so rewarding. "
2055,that sounds nice ! it will all be worth it someday ! He'll love you forever!
2055,I hope so! I'll do my best. 
2055,I'm sure you're doing great. Pups are amazingly resilient. 
2055,So are cats. I had one when I was a kid that I loved so much. 
2055,I dig that they aren't attention sponges...much lol.
2056,"I work in a hotel, what do you do?"

2056,"I have. I like a good t-bone, ribeye or new york strip."
2056,have you tried that new plant meat?
2056,"plant meat? lol no, what is that? a joke right? lol"
2056,supposed to be fake meat made from plants
2057,Have you ever visited the beach?
2057,"No I have not, I have often dreamed of going though."
2057,"It's an amazing experience depending when you go. In Hawaii, it's really warm."
2057,i have never been but i hear the beaches are pretty . do you travel ?
2057,I do. I have traveled only traveled inside of the US though.
2057,Do you want to travel outside the US?
2057,I would like to travel to places like Japan and Korea. DO you travel?
2057,I do. My family has moved 40 times.
2057,"Wow, that's a lot! Have you been outside the US?"
2057,No I have not but I am going on a cruise to Cozumel next spring.
2057,So you will be able to see the ocean? That's Great!
2057,Yeah I am looking forward to that. What beaches have you been to?
2058,"No, actually this is now the 14 child in the last 8 years!"
2058,Oh my gosh! I assume some of them are twins?
2058,sextuplets once and quintuplets another time. The only thing I'm afraid of  is when she's pregnant she gets sooooo humongous that she runs into everything. Work at a lab.
2058,I should make a song about this lol. Do you think she would mind?
2058,Maybe I can sing it to her while I'm wearing my Olympic gold metal from the 1970's for the shot put.
2058,That would be awesome! I'm sure she would think it was hilarious! You should film it and put it on social media.
2058,Are you a professional song writer? What type of music do you write about. BTW: I'm in the middle of a Sky Dive. It gets windy up here!
2058,"No, but I play guitar and I write country music when I feel like it. I would say don't fall, but that's the point lol."
2058,"Oh wow. That is so cool! I really enjoy listen to acoustics. No electric anything. If you don't here from me, its cause I didn't make it. I'm jumping nooooooooooow...."
2058,"It's the acoustic that I play. Maybe if you survive, we can set up a time to meet and we can write the song for your wife!"
2058,"I just landed. Not to bad since my parachute didn't open. I only broke both my legs. Man, my wife would really love that! Your awesome"
2058,"Well, at least you have your dignity. Perhaps now you guys will have to find a new hobby."
2058,"Naw, I'm headed back up right now before I go to the hospital. I'll wear my lucky Olympic Gold this time! See ya"

2060,Since I can remember. I enjoy it a lot
2060,do you make a lot of money off it?
2060,"It depends, but its not about making money."
2060,"i get that, i teach make up for free so i know the sentiment."

2062,I haven't watched the Tonight Show in ages. 
2062,I haven't really watched it on TV but my family watches it sometimes.
2062,"Oh, I normally watch crime related shows."

2062,"Exactly, I love seeing the different interviews and reviewing all of the research. "
2062,I am going bald nowadays.
2062,"Really, hair loss can be attractive. "

2063,There are so many things to worry about. Most of all I want my son to be safe. I worry about all the violence
2063,oh jeez haha that's my worst nightmare
2063,"Yes, it's hard to even read the news these days. All the violence and shootings, it's scary"
2063,Yea it can really be. I was 30 minutes to an hour away from a couple of those Texas shootings
2063,Wow. I'm glad you were at a safe distance
2063,So am I. I really need to get a firearm though because we do travel a lot because of my boyfriends job.

2064,"Oh okay, do you follow any sports?"
2064,Sometimes basketball..
2064,"cool, do you have a favorite team?"

2064,"Yep, i grew up in LA. Would of been nice if they had landed Kawhi"
2064,Agree
2064,I can't believe they lost to the clippers last night.

2064,"I live in Maryland, near washington D.C"
2064,how's weather there?
2065,"I like the beach as well , but not good at fishing"
2065,I got to spend a week on the beach a few months ago. It's a great and relaxing place to be. I love the sound of the ocean
2065,"That's great, I wish I can spend that long over there, the atmosphere helps take away sustained stressined stress. "
2065,You should really find time to do it. It will calm you soul. 
2065,"I know, I will try though it's hard to frequent especially with family"
2065,I understand that. It's hard to relax with family around. sometimes i think they cause the stress. lol
2066,I do eat sushi but it took me a long time to like it. I actually work for the Golden Arches!
2066,I LOVE sushi. But McDonald's is sometimes what you just crave. What's your favorite food there?
2066,"Fries. when they are really hot. I can't eat the other stuff, well, maybe a hash brown. What do you do for fun?"
2066,I hate them cold. I love to read but need my cateye glasses to do it!
2066,Perfect vision here. and you are right cold fries are gross. I have 20 20 vision. Helps with scoring hoops. 
2066,Do you like basketball? I wish I had better vision
2066,I am a big basketball player ( not professional) and watch alot of games. Sorry about the vision. Have you always had glasses?
2066,"what position? And yeah, since I was young. It's tough to find glasses to match my olive skin!"
2066,"I play forward for the local scrub team. And remember skin colour doesn't matter for glasses, it's the shape of your face that is the deal breaker. "
2066,"That's awesome. I played point until I stopped growing! And true, I just love bright colors. What else do you do for fun?"
2066,"Fun is hard to come by these days. I don't make a lot of money, so my fun stuff has to be free.  "
2066,That's totally understandable. Do you live near DC
2067,Definitely. I enjoy cooking healthy meals but it gets tricky when I go out to eat.
2067,That's a tough one. Do you eat out a lot? That's usually the culprit. I had to learn how to cook for myself so I could afford to live.
2067,It's much cheaper and I enjoy cooking. When I eat out it's usually when I'm going on a date.
2067,Same! I make food at home nearly 100% of the time. My boyfriend and I chill at home and watch movies a lot. 
2067,I'm probably 50/50 at the moment which makes it tough to eat healthily. What type of movies do you like?
2067,"I really enjoy Marvel movies and romances. Honestly, my favorite genre is comedy though. "
2067,"A good comedy is always fun, but to be honest I always want to snack when I watch movies."
2067,There is nothing wrong with a little snacking! Popcorn actually has very little calories and is a great movie snack! 
2067,I love popcorn! I need to remember that. I usually reach for chips but popcorn would be a great alternative. Thanks for that information.
2067,"Plus, the off brand kind tastes exactly the same. So you can save some money! "
2067,"Win, win! Awesome."
2067,Did you hear about SunnyD being made from pure corn syrup? Yuk! 
2068,yeah that is so true. how about you?
2068,Family is important as well. One of my favorite places to go with my daughter is to the mall.
2068,yes. My family loves me as wwell.
2068,What do you like doing most with your family?
2068,i love the company and support
2068,"My family thought it was funny when we decided to get a pug, they blurted out let's name him Corky. I was like WHAT?"
2069,I think I will put in my two weeks soon.

2069,"Thank you! I am still a little nervous, but I'm sure I'll pull through. Are you happy with your current company? "
2069,i love being a pilot
2069,That's awesome. Where did you learn to fly?

2069,What places have you flown to?
2069,"all over the us . if you can name it , i've probably been down it"
2070,Definitely. My cats were even there to contribute.
2070,Aw that is so sweet. How many cats do you have?
2070,I have 3. Do you have any?
2070,"I don't have any at the moment, I rent a flat and my landlord won't let me. Definitely going to get one once I get my own place."
2071,"yeah, its a lot on top of a full time job."
2071,oh i am also in grad school . rather just finished .
2071,what did you graduate in?
2071,It was in Marketing. I had the highest Grade Point Average in my graduating class.
2071,"thats awesome, you would fit in well at my job then."
2071,I am going for more education first. They called me the dux due to being the highest ranking student.
2071,"interesting, i've never heard of that name before."
2071,yeah its a weird name i know 
2071,yep so what else do you like to do?
2071,I plan to do some volunteer work.
2071,thats cool.
2071,Volunteering is also great to make contacts for possible employment.
2072,"I have a dachshund, have had many. Do you have a dog?"
2072,No i do not but I would love to get a German Sheppard or Doberman
2072,You're a big dog person! I love all dogs. You should get one.
2072,yea sure i love the german shepherds dods as they really make me happy
2072,You live in the city?
2072,"Yes, what about you?"
2072,I live in the suburbs in a small condo but I have a swamp behind me and my dog loves it lol
2072,Haha! That is so cute!
2072,It must be hard to take care of a dog living in the city
2072,"Yes, but i think it is not impossible."
2072,I hope you get a german sheppard soon. They give you unconditional love!
2072,Yea the german shepherd is great at being a working dog
2073,Do you follow any professional sports teams?
2073,"Not really, how about you?"
2073,"all the time, I am loving the ability to sportsbet now also."
2073,where do you live?
2073,I live in Maryland near washington d.c
2073,how's its like to be there?
2073,Its quite interesting. We get a lot of the national media b/c of politics.
2073,I heard traffic is not much fan in that area
2073,Your not kidding. I live 4 miles from work and takes me 20-30 min to get there.
2073,Once I was travelling from DC to Baltimore .. I remember some the traffic in that area
2073,Where do you live? Is traffic bad there also?
2073,I am in Atlanta.. we have our fare share too
2074,"We did actually. Adam was very social like me, so there were a lot to choose from. Julie is taking it hard though. I'd know you see.."
2074,I'm sorry. That must be difficult. I am glad you have pictures and memories to hold on to though.
2074,"They always say time is the remedy. They're wrong.. It helps to have place to go to though, and I convinced Julie not to cremate. "
2074,That's so true! I have a theory that time is just a way to keep everything from happening at once.
2074,Wow! That's inspiring.. Do you know what St Augustine says about time?
2074,"I have no idea, do tell me?"
2074,"Well, it's somehting on the lines of: you know what time is only when you do not deliberately try figuring it out. I learnt about it from a professor friend."
2074,"Interesting!  Janis Joplin said ""It's all the same day, man"" concerning time haha"
2074,My late husband loved those of the Club of 27.. We played Castles Made of Sand in his funeral. It was... nice.
2074,He sounds like someone I would have liked to have known :)
2074,"Aw.. Thank you. I truly appreciate that. Sometimes I think I should have gone first, but then, I know it'd have been harder on him than it is on me."
2074,"He will always live on through spirit in your heart of hearts, I'm sorry for the loss."
2075,Yes thankfully. We managed to evacuate and my family is safe but we lost everything we own. 
2075,I am very sorry to hear that. I hope for your sake that things are getting back to normal and the destruction is being taken care of.
2075,Thank you! We have faith that everything will be rebuilt but for now we have to figure out where we can live. 
2075,"I am so sorry. I wish I could help, if i was closer. "
2076,We were on a hiking trip and he fell and broke his leg.
2076,"Oh dam, sorry to hear. Hopefully he recovers quickly. "
2076,"Thanks, it was awful my husband had to walk halfway down the mountain before he could get a signal to call 911."
2076,Interesting. Lately I try to watch what I eat. So only healthy foods. What food do you like?
2076,The doctor said I need more iron in my diet so I've been eating a lot of spinach and meat.
2076,I'm not too much into spinach myself. I prefer salads and fruits. 
2076,I try to incorporate spinach into my salads that way I don't notice the taste.
2076,Good idea. I think exercising is important too. I will try going to the gym more often. 
2076,"Yes, I try to exercise everyday but I prefer being outside walking or hiking."
2076,Hiking seems really nice. What times are the best to go?
2076,I prefer going in the afternoon because I'm not much a morning person.
2076,I'm not a morning person as well. I think during the weekend would be the best. 
2077,Agreed. It is my go-to stress reliever
2077,That is true I've used it many times in the past to reduce stress and anxiety.
2077,"I like to play tennis, too. It's a great way to get some exercise and be social at the same time"
2077,"Yes,, it's good exercise for everyone."
2077,Do you play?
2077,"no , i just play to release stress and get some exercise ."
2077,"Got it, that's cool. What else do you like to do?"
2077,"I like to exercise, though I'm always busy"
2077,"Yeah, it's hard to find the time for fun. I like going out in the evenings sometimes. There are so cool spots around here for live music and stuff"
2077,"Yes, going outings with my family is another good one for me. My children love it so much"
2077,I bet. How many kids do you have?
2077,"4, they keep me very busy"
2078,Really? How was it? was it good?
2078,"I watched it for the animation and it was brilliant. The characters are cute, but the design is awesome. Have you seen a my little pony?"
2078,Oh that is great! I have not seen little pony but i heard it was good. 
2078,The colours are what make the whole concept. It's like the rainbow coming to life. so joyful . I hope I am not being too weird. 
2078,No you are totally fine. You are very lucky to experience it in person
2078,I collect the figures too. I have about 160 my little ponies. Do you collect anything?
2078,No i dont collect them. Are they expensive to collect?
2078,"No not really. The older ones in boxes are expensive, but no more than 20 bucks. Do you have a collection of something, like cars or teapots?"
2078,I don't have any collection. But i do like to remodel homes and go hunting if i can
2078,That's a great hobby remodeling homes.Are you into certain colours for painting? and when you say hunting do you mean animals?  
2078,"I like to remodel homes with mostly white colors. I think they are beautiful. When i hunt, i mostly hunt deers "
2078,Okay I love using white everything and then putting little ponies to add a splash of colour. I am glad you don't hunt ponies :) 
2079,"It has, thankfully."
2079,Do you still work in a bank.
2079,I do. Where do you work?
2079,I'm an artist. I work from home.
2079,That's amazing. I wish I could draw.
2079,I also like working on cars. 
2079,That is neat. I definitely don't know anything about cars.
2079,I wish I had a garage to work on them. It is tough working in my driveway.
2079,"Yeah, I bet that would be difficult. Maybe one day..."
2079,I certainly hope so. That would be great.
2079,Yes! Absolutely. What is your favorite car to work on?
2079,My favorite car is a Fiat Pop 500C but it never breaks down.
2080,I found out about the dance class on a blog. I'm sure you would love it
2080,yes it sounds so very fun! almost as fun as shopping for clothes! that's my favorite thing to do
2080,Same here but I love to barbecue as well. Shopping and eating is the best haha.
2080,barbecue is delicious! eating too much of it is probably why i have to shop for size 12 though lol
2080,Same here. Can't eat barbecue with tight pants!
2080,hahaha true! my biggest weakness is probably pizza though. i love it
2080,Stuffed crust and extra cheese is mine!It's the best witha a side of wings!
2080,oh yum ! i love extra spicy hot wings and a pepperoni pizza
2080,I think we're both ready for dinner!
2080,haha absolutely! i'm starving
2080,Same!And I have yet to start making it. It might be pizza night!
2080,i'm thinking about that too! we'll see. enjoy your dinner and your night!
2080,You as well!
2081,"Hahaha! That is true. Makes you wonder how many beautiful things are just scientific illusions, especially when you think of neuroscience"
2081,There is a sense of magic within these scientific illusions.
2081,What do you mean? Like how much hard work and talent has went into them to discover them?
2081,Pretty much.
2081,But they only do not have to be talented. I have found that working hard for things will make you achieve great things
2081,What in your experience has made you say that?
2081,"I have not had parental support and safety net in my life since I am orphan. It has been tought, but I have worked hard "
2081,That's at least good. You are a self-sufficient person which in these days is more of a rarity.
2081,How about you? Do you work hard?
2081,I would say I do. I recently got promoted at my current job after only having worked there for about six months.
2081,Congrats! What do you do for living?
2081,I'm an office worker. How about yourself?
2082,That's awesome! Always wanted to try that out. 
2082,Go for it! My Mom has her own studio and everything. 
2082,I will! That is pretty rad though! Lowkey jealous! 
2082,"I was going to invite you to see her work sometime! Her place is in Baltimore, where I grew up."
2082,I appreciate the jester. That would be cool to do! I am currently in Washington state which I think is like 40 hours away
2082,That's a long drive.
2082,"Yeah it is! I recently just drove from Texas to here, which was a 36hour long drive! But let me tell you, it was a beautiful drive!"
2082,Thats amazing.  Did  you drive by yourself?
2082,No. My boyfriend was with because he has to travel to all these places for work and I get to tag along.
2082,Thats a good deal! 
2082,Yeah. I need to look in what it take in this area to get my real estate license. Then I can Sell homes as i travel
2082,go for it ! you have to live your dreams
2083,I live by myself however I do have a dog.
2083,oh awesome I have a german shepard. What about you?
2083,Labrador. I used to have a GSD but he passed away about 2 years ago.
2083,Yeah I had to put down my 13 year old girl down 6 months ago.
2083,That's sad..Sometimes when I am feeling down I just turn on some country music and listen to it with my boy. He is like family to me.
2083,"Yeah, I know I cannot imagine not having a good old boy around"
2083,He is just turning 7 so I have a little time but want to start thinking about getting another soon.
2083,"I love puppies, i have a 2 year old crazy GSD."
2083,Yeah the large breed dogs stay puppies for a long time. A GSD have lots of drive and they need a job.
2083,"Yeah i know. My pup has a job, I now have a 6th month old child who adores him."
2083,Oh he will be very protective of your child for sure. They become very close to children.
2083,"Yeah, all he wants to do is lick his face."
2084,what school you go to?
2084,I go to Carnegie Mellon U and they have a great pool there.
2084,Wow! that is a very good university
2084,Yeah! Hard though so I need to exercise a lot to destress.
2084,Seems like you are a swimmer.
2084,Well I love it but can only go once a week so that I have time for yoga.
2084,You know they said swimming is a total body workout.
2084,"It's great, do you swim much?"
2084,"No. I am not a swimmer, but I do Yoga."
2084,"Oh cool, something we have in common."
2084,yeah! But I think my yoga studio is the best in the world.
2084,Oh environment sure matters.
2085,hi...do you like the outdoors?
2085,I like camping and being outdoors.  I enjoy sitting around a campfire listening to the bugs.
2085,me too
2085,What kind of music do you like?  I am into Lindsey Stirling.
2085,i love adele. into very much british stuff
2085,I hear she puts on a good show.  Have you ever seen her live?
2085,yes in London
2085,"Way cool! I wanted to see her when she was in Vegas, but I could not get tickets."
2085,yeah she is quite the famous
2085,I would love to visit London sometime
2085,it is so pretty. The culture is so awesome!
2085,I will hopefully get to go there next year on Vacation.  As a tourist what would be the one thing I should absolutely see in London?
2086,I think it is important to stay fit
2086,I agree. I have made it a personal goal to start a consistent exercise routine in the next couple of weeks.
2086,"That's great to hear, you should always exercise"
2086,Yes! I also want to change my diet. Do you have any suggestions?
2086,Eat lots of fruits and vegetables!
2086,"Yes, you're right. I'm going to eliminate junk food and sodas."
2086,That's a great idea. You will be much healthier
2086,"Yes, that's the goal! I want to lost about 20 pounds. Hopefully, I can achieve that in 6 months."
2086,"I hope you can, I think it is definitely possible!"
2086,Thanks for the extra motivation!
2086,"No problem, I am here to help!"
2086,I appreciate that! 
2087,I just listened to a great Celtic band. so folksy.  The are called the Pipers and they are from Ireland. Do you play an instrument?
2087,I do!  I play the acoustic guitar quite frequently. I like to play stuff like Damien Rice and Jewel.  Do you play any instruments as well?
2087,"I am a guitar player too, but my passion is really country music, I was raised on Johnny Cash. "
2087,"Love him! My dad told me when I was first started playing guitar if I could learn G, C, D, and Em I could play all his songs. lol"
2087,Totally true. I just played Fulsom prison on the guitar to my cat. I thinks he likes it. Do you have any pets?
2087,I used to.  She lives with my mom now and her other cat Honey Bee.  My cat's name is Dixie.  I miss her. =(
2087,I have had animals around me all my live. Sorry about Dixie. I know how that feels. Can you bare to get another cat maybe?
2087,"Unfortunately no, if I was able to get another animal, I'd get her back first anyway. I love cats a lot."
2087,"Funny how cats just know people and give their affection on their terms. I love all animals, especially more as I am getting older. Is your mom far away?"
2087,"Not really, she's only about an hour drive from where I live now so I still visit them every other week or so."
2087,Oh that's good. Does Dixie listen to music ever?
2087,"Yes, I used to sing to her all the time.  My parents' overheard me sing Dixie Doodle in the tune of Yankee Doodle one time...."
2088,"Yes, I'm excited. "
2088,I was planning on taking her to a nice dinner tonight do you have any suggestions? 
2088,Since we're both from Germany I was planning on taking her to some Oktoberfest celebrations. 
2088,Thanks! I'm so excited I can't wait!
2088,What's her favorite type of food? That may help narrow down the restaurant options.
2088,Well she's a vegetarian so it's not as easy as taking her to a nice Italian place or something. I think she prefers Mediterranean food the most
2088,I love Mediterranean food too! Mostly so I can practice my spanish. There are some great listings on yelp if you need help finding a good option.
2088,"Yep, thanks for the suggestion. Yelp is definitely one of my go to places for reviews they are the best and usually the most recently updated. "
2088,"Yes, it's helped my out in deciding on restaurants several times. What else do you have planned for while she's visiting?"
2088,I'm going to show her my home town and where I grew up. She's also meeting the parents for the first time!
2088,That sounds like so much fun! I hope meeting your parents goes well.
2088,Thanks me too! I hope my crazy brother doesn't scare her off!
2089,I've been a fan of the eagles since I was 8 years old. They're my favorite team.
2089,That is great. I am a Titans fan myself.
2089,Nice! I guess my loyalty stems from the fact that my hometown is in Philadelphia.
2089,Mine is Nashville so that is mine
2089,"Oh I see. Since I live in a retirement home, it's peaceful on Sundays when I watch the game. I love it."
2089,I bet. I wish it was quiet here. I have two phones and one is always ringing.
2089,Do you get a lot of calls for work? Or the telemarketers are bothering you? 
2089,A little bit of both. The telemarketers are getting out of control. Do you get a lot?
2089,I do! I get a lot of calls earlier in the day.
2089,They are a nuisance. They even called during my favorite movie.
2089,So bothersome! At least they don't call me during the game or when I am baking! That would upset me.
2089,I can imagine. Seems to always be at the worst time
2090,"Exactly, I do love history too."
2090,I find world war II history very interesting.
2090,What is it that you like best about World War II?
2090,I like the war tactics. Maybe because I can read about it and then follow up with a video game or movie
2090,Do you play a lot of video games?
2090,I used to play COD all the time. I have a newborn so not much time now.
2090,I'm sure that does take up all your time. Raising a family is a lot of fun but a lot of work.
2090,Yeah it is great right now. Its just hard because he goes to sleep early I dont get much time with him.
2090,"True, time really goes by quickly when they are young."
2090,Yeah i can't believe he is already 6 months old
2090,Do you post a lot of videos and photos of him online?
2090,"Yes, I do. Our friends love seeing him. Do you have kids?"
2091,Yes. I think I would be very lonely here in the retirement home without them. 
2091,I believe that. Family is important and it means a lot to stick together in rough times. 
2091,I couldn't agree more. Now I am just waiting for my grandchildren to come. 
2091,How many grandkids do you have?
2091,10 so far.  do you have any?

2091,"oh I'm sorry. Grandkids are great, I can spoil them and send them home!!"
2091,It's ok! I know she enjoyed our visits very much. I know my parents feel the same way about my children. They spoil them all the time!
2091,I bet your parents are having a blast. That is your parents getting even. That's what my mom always told me 
2091,My parents say the same thing haha. My kids have a blast so I don't mind it. 
2091,That's great. Do they get to see them often? 
2091,"Yes, thankfully they live very close so they get to visit often. What about your grandkids?"

2092,"yes, i've read about that on the news. it's quite frightening"

2102,"No, not yet."
2102,"I see, what do you think is the career he will chooses?"
2102,"Most likely he will study finance. His grades are good but not the best, so we just don't know what to expect."
2103,"He is the best, I got very lucky with him. How about you? Do you have someone special?"
2103,Currently I do not. I made a mistake awhile back so I am single now.
2103,"Well, I know things will work out, and you will find that special person when the time is right"

2103,It crazy the difference. My 16 year old is the worst. lol He is getting the worst attitude. 
2103,I feel you. Those teenage years are really when they start trying to find themselves so they test boundaries.
2104,"Yeah, no kidding. Maybe an SPF 1000!"
2104,"Haha perhaps! Those islands near the equator are scorching hot. Having been to Cuba and the DR, it was pretty sweaty vacationing."
2104,I bet there's some beautiful scenery to look at. I love exploring new places and seeing new things. 
2104,"You should definitely take a trip to those places, especially Cuba, with its rich history and its beautiful beaches."

2104,You should go to the many many restaurants there.
2104,Is there one that you could recommend? i'm not that familiar with Cuban cuisine. 
2104,I would probably say Siglo Vente would be the one I remember most from my visit there.
2104,"Is there a particular dish there that you favor? Like I said, I'm clueless!"
2104,Ropa vieja would be the standard for Cuban cuisine.

2105,I have left college with a creative writing degree. You will be a character in a story some day!
2105,"Congratulations on graduating! Yes! Famous at last...the sweet potato loving, cliff jumping, hockey player."
2106,Yeah I'm not really hurt just kind of mad about it.
2106,why are you mad what happened ?
2106,I was trying to grab my dog but she made me lose my balance in front of this person I like.
2106,oh no ! well that's no good

2106,hope you get them fixed soon . are they expensive ?
2107,how's the grocery working out?
2107,It's not bad. The work is easy and I think I perform well. I do hope I get a raise soon.
2107,I hear that. So any new acting gigs?
2107,"unfortunately , no , not any more these days ."
2107,I understand. It's tough out here. I'm trying to move but someone doesn't want me to.

2108,Paying the bills is always the goal... but I love my bike.

2108,"Yes, that would be cool. "
2108,The next one should occur on Nov. 21 2021. Not to far away
2108,"Oh, that's not far way at all. Be sure to save the date!"
2109,"Yes, this is true.  But if one of my 4 cats or two dogs get sick, I might need to get somewhere fast."
2109,I feel you as I am used to just walking to places that i need to be at.
2109,And I could do that.  I am sure I could find one of my 30 pair of shoes good for walking.

2109,"Yeah, I know how particular people are about shoes. I thought it would be a good idea."
2109,"I do like a cute pair of shoes, by the sounds of it you do too."

2119,Nope on the UK! No pets either
2119,"Pets can be a pain, so you are feel and clear! What about hobbies? I rock climb and canoe. "
2119,Oh nice! I love canoeing too
2119,I canoe in a vintage Canadian canoe. So quiet and peaceful. Are you into nature?
2119,"Yeah I love Lake Tanganyika and Lake Victoria, and being around any other water."
2119,"That's some big water. tell me, how do you feel about tourists?"
2119,I think it's fun to meet tourists as long as they are respectful of nature
2119,"Yes, not all though. I once nearly feel off a rock when someone was trying to get a selfie. Do you feel connected to nature? Like spiritually?"
2119,Yeah tourists can be pushy sometimes. I'm glad you're ok. Oh yeah totally spiritually.
2120,Nobody likes to encounter that! lol that's way Dentists are so important
2120,"Exactly, though I'm having trouble finding the right dentist. Everything costs so much."
2120,"I know that, and insurances don't really help that much. "
2120,"Tell me about it. I'm dealing with some problems myself, being divorced has also been a hindrance to my financial income."
2120,"oh no, I am sorry to hear that. I have been through divorce, it's not a fun thing. Things will get better."
2120,How long were you two married? It's been a rough 2 years but hopefully I'll get by.
2120,"I was married for 3 years, we also had a son, so that made it difficult. You'll eventually be okay. "
2120,Thank you. Sorry to hear about your situation. Are you a dog or cat person?
2120,"Thank you. I prefer dogs, but I do own both. How about you?"
2120,"I prefer cats, got two here. I like both cats and dogs, but cats are easier to maintain."
2120,"I don't know. I think my dog is easier, my cat is a princess and has to have everything her way or she'll bite me lol"
2120,"Aww. Cats and dogs are like people, with their own personalities."
2120,That's for sure! 
2121,Where am I?
2121,"I dont know, I work for amazon, its such a great company ."
2121,How is working for Amazon?
2121,It great they offer a lot of services and development programs for their employees so I am happy
2121,Should I work for Amazon?
2121,You should. They have a great rep as an international company
2121,I have never traveled outside of Texas.
2121,"I love Texas, its a big state"
2122,i was very angry
2122,Did you tell them that?
2122,no but  i was very mad inside
2122,"That's understandable, I would be too. It would be a good idea to tell them how you feel so they don't do it again."
2122,yeah. Did you experience anything similar?
2122,Yeah kinda. There was a coworker I liked and my other coworkers said something to them without my consent. I was mad.
2122,that was bad. did you report it ?
2122,No. It was immature and nothing serious. I just told them to mind their business. They apologized. 
2122,that is good. wanna share anything else that is on your mind?
2122,"Sure, I'm pretty excited for the upcoming holidays. Especially halloween. What about you? Any holiday plans?"
2122,not really. I need to work!
2122,Bummer. I was lucky to get Halloween off but Thanksgiving isn't a sure thing. 
2123,"Haha! Oh yeah, I love both of those :) "
2123,The chefs are so creative and know the different decorating techniques so well!
2123,What sorts of things do they decorate?
2123,"All the different pastries and baked goods, some of them even carve cheese."
2123,Nice. I studied abroad in France when I was in college. Too poor to indulge in anything too fancy back in those days :) 
2123,"Ah, yes I would love to go France. The closest I can get is shopping for food with my daughters. :)"
2123,"That's fun, too! How many daughters do you have?"
2123,"I have two of them, and they love to cook just as much as I do."
2123,That's really cool. I have one son but he's still a little young to cook with me. How old were your daughters when they started showing an interest in cooking?
2123,"Around four and five, they seen me making dinner one night and wanted to help."
2123,That makes sense. Kids learn so much from watching their parents
2123,Absolutely! Especially with early learning in children. How old is your son now?
2123,He's 4. He'll turn 5 in February
2124,why so?
2124,"More from (what I perceived to be) health reasons. Not so much political, environmental, cultural....have you ever tried?"
2124,i haven't but I am open to possiblities
2124,I'm glad to see that. Having the right mindset is always the first step.
2124,yup. How do you start about it ?
2124,"One tip I tell people is that they don't need to change WHAT they eat, only how much. Calorie intake is the important factor, not what type of calories."
2124,oh thank you. such great advice. So you are into fitness?
2124,"Yeah, I'm pretty new to this whole gym lifestyle. But I like that I can attend different kinds of workout classes."
2124,sounds very cool
2124,"it is. and it really is like the saying ""every day is easier"""
2124,i see. such a positive mindset you got
2124,"It is! Thanks, dude. Do you go to the gym at all?"
2125,Yeah unfortunatley I'm one of those people.
2125,sorry to hear that . i have blurred vision but with glasses i can see .
2125,My glasses work for me too.
2125,"That is exactly what they are used for, vision correction!"
2125,so true
2125,"are you able to work without your glasses, I'm not comfortable doing that "
2125,i can but it's not good for me to do that.
2125,i understand ... sometimes I feel shy wearing them too
2125,i understand. it doesn't make me feel shy.
2125,Yeah I feel scared wearing them sometimes like people are judging me.
2125,well i bet they are not judging you.
2125,"i hope so , thank you"
2126,but i am a free soul. I like to travel and see the world
2126,"I want to travel, but I have never left my state."
2126,you should. I am from Texas btw
2126,Me too.  I went to an all girls Christian High School and I still live in the same town I grew up in.
2126,wow that's cool. I live in Austin btw
2126,"I live in the Dallas area, but I have been to Austin a lot."
2126,yup Dallas is more spread out. Austin is liberal and college(ish) fun
2126,Very true.  I love the vibe in Austin.  My favorite thing to do in Austin is visit all the weird museums. 
2126,yep the downtown ones. Houston has more museums though 
2126,What is your favorite thing to do in Austin?
2126,walk around UT
2126,Have you ever been to South by South West?  I have always wanted to go
2127,My family is really close. Do you have cousins?
2127,"Yep, I have 2 brothers and 1 sister"
2127,Do you work? I have a job 5 days a week
2127,I do IT but only part time
2127,I like cleaning and exercising. What are some of your hobbies?
2127,I love fishing.
2127,Fishing is so fun. I used to fish a lot as a kid
2127,Fishing is truly fun. We occasionally go with my friends too. Do you go frequently?
2127,"Yeah, but not as much. Maybe about once a week I can go"
2127,Where do you go the most?
2127,Lakes and parks. The ocean would be cool to go someday
2127,Did you ever use fake bait?
2128,"I am a savage, I passed. "
2128,haha..i am scared of medical tests
2128,why's that? 
2128,if tested positive ive to stop having ALL THE FUN!!
2128,I get you! lol where are you from. im currently in Washington 
2128,I AM IN MARYLAND..
2128,Sorry! was making coffee. forgot about this for a second
2128,wow how can you forget money? lol
2128,That a great question! 
2128,i know right...the world runs on money 
2128,Money = everything
2128,yup very true..everyone has that things in common
2129,"Yes, but we live in rural Wisconsin so we don't get much chance to swim. Where do you live?"
2129,Florida. It's so hot here all year that you could almost swim anytime! Do you like spicy food>
2129,I envy your winters but not your summers. My wife is from India so we eat lots of spicy food.. I love it!
2129,Great! Do you travel much? 
2129,"We go to Minneapolis and Milwaukee a few times a month, but we are busy here much of the year. What about you?"
2129,Cool! I have been to Europe and Mexico? Do you think you'd like to travel outside the US?
2129,"We have been to India a few times to visit my wifes family, but they moved to Milwaukee a few years ago. Have you been to India?"
2129,"Nice! No, I haven't. I bet it's wonderful there!"
2129,"It is very hot and dusty. I couldn't live there, but at least it doesn't snow!"
2129,LOL that's funny and true!
2129,I guess you don't get snow in Florida?
2129,Only at the northernmost end. Down south where I am it is way too hot for snow. I would like to visit somewhere snowy just to see what it's like.
2130,"Well he's kind in other ways, so I don't know. He's good with my kids."
2130,"That makes it hard. My last boyfriend was great at times, and other times he was flirting with other women, and on dating sites. "
2130,Oh that's bad if he was supposed to be exclusive with you.
2130,"He was supposed to be, but that's why it's hard to tell. You need to look at how he treats you, not just your kids"
2130,Yeah we might take time away from each other after I come back from my trip.
2130,"Sometimes that is whats best, just to figure things out"
2130,I agree. I hope you have a better boyfriend now.
2130,I do. I got really lucky. You need to be with someone who always puts you first and treats you like a queen. 
2130,Oh I'm glad to hear that. Hm that's good advice.
2130,"It's true. If he is making you jealous and not treating you right, he isn't the right one for you. "
2130,I guess it's hard to know sometimes because maybe he's just stressed.
2130,I know. Stress is a reason for a little while but not all the time. 
2131,I am not an art collector. Do you like art?
2131,yes i do. but I actually prefer technology.
2131,I like to read and Amazon Kindle is a great app for me. I love it!
2131,"I love the kindle, Technology has made reading great."
2131,It is. What is your favorite thing about technology?
2131,"I mainly use it for online dating recently, great way to meet people."
2131,How it goes? I hope you find a perfect match.
2131,"Me too, it's hard to find people taller than me though, I wouldn't date someone shorter."
2131,"How tall are you? I am only 5'1"". I wish I can be taller."
2131,"I am 6"" so finding a man taller is really difficult."
2131,"Yes, but I am sure you will find a good man. What web do you use?"
2131,I prefer to use Chrome when I'm online.
2132,I get to travel a lot and go to meetings mostly
2132,Sounds great. I get to travel a lot for my company as well. 
2132,What are some countries you have been to?
2133,I love cooking. 
2133,"Oh that isn't anything I like to, I am not good at cooking at all. What do you do for a living?"
2133,I'm an office worker. You should try looking up tutorials or videos to learn. It saves on the amount of money you spend on food every week too.
2133,My husband does all the cooking so that is helpful. 
2133,What does he usually cook? I forgot to ask you what you did for a living haha.
2133,Or I am currently an intern at a computer company and I am still in school as well.
2133,What are you studying? 
2133,I want to be vet
2133,That's a noble profession. My wife's parents as well as a mutual friend of ours is in that field. 
2133,I love animals and like to help them. It's going to be a lot of education but I have faith I will one day graduate
2133,"It's a tough educational track, much like the human medical field, but it'll be worth it."
2133,Yes and with a lot of student debt as well so I will have to work when in school as well.
2134,Oh wow.. Do you have any plans to get that checked out?/
2134,Possibly in the future. I live in a big city so there should be lots of doctors to choose from.
2134,"I hope you do, can't make your vision get more worse than it is, trust me. Which city?"
2134,New York City. Where do you live?
2134,Same! I live in Brooklyn. You?
2134,Awesome! Manhatten. What do you do for fun?
2134,I love to listen and play music. I also like to dance. How about yourself?
2134,That's cool. I love singing? What kind of dance do you do?
2134,I love to salsa but I enjoy hip hop dancing as well. I hear a lot of hip hop during the day so i'm used to it more. 
2134,That sounds so fun. Lots of places around town to do that too. What else do you like to do? 
2134,I like to walk around the park with my dog. You?
2134,I love the parks! I like running in them and just anything outside
2135,I will. Ill have to take notes as well.
2135,"Ted talks are interesting, and they can be fun to listen to as well."
2135,"What are his main topics?Do you think it's worth it to take some notes?I can probably type while he speaks, I type 140 words per minute."
2135,Ok. I love the Ted talks on politics
2135,That sounds interesting I'll have to look into those. 
2136,I know I am! I would've had a hard time telling people where I was from if the original name had stuck :) 
2136,So you are from London?  I am from a small city in northern Florida
2136,I am originally from London but my family moved to the states when I was very small 
2136,"If you are here now, maybe you could come for a visit and I could barbecue something up."
2136,Oh that's so kind but I'm afraid it would have to be tofu or veggies or something. I am a vegetarian (don't hate me)
2137,It's a great thing. Lol
2137,What did you do while they are gone?
2137,I went on a date with my husband.
2137,fun ! where did you go to ?
2137,we went to the shows and to eat
2137,Sounds like you got the date you deserved.
2137,Thank you!
2137,and where did the children go this weekend?
2137,to my sisters
2137,"Oh my, I wish I had a sister so considerate to help."
2137,Mine is the very best. Maybe yours will do better.
2137,Hopefully.
2138,"not sure, but I know I can still have peanuts"
2138,"I can have almonds and brazil nuts only. Any other nut will make me dumpy. I love nuts to, but My long legs make me too dumpy."
2138,oh wow you better be careful. Hazel nuts don't show up as much in meals as almond
2138,I was eating nutella. Do you like that chocolate spread. I can eat it plain with a spoon or my finger depending on who's around.
2138,lol i know exactly what you when you say depending on who it around.  Too bad i cant have it 
2138,Why. You don't like the taste? it goes great will the one gallon jug of milk that I don't put in a glass and drink straight out of.
2138,nutella is a hazel nut spread. I love drinking milk like that too 
2138,"Oh, I didn't know that. I got to stop eating it then. It will make me all dumpy. I'm kinda self cautious about my super long legs."
2138,I am kinda jealous. I have super short legs 
2138,"Not when your legs are 5ft4"" in height and the rest of your body is 1 ft to the head. Im 6ft4 all together."
2138,oh wow. that is impressive 
2138,I thought God was playing a joke on me after my legs stretched out and the rest of my body stayed the same at age 4. Only my legs grew!
2139,"When you do music by yourself it has to be good, you have passion for it"
2139,but music is fun but not enough money in it unless you make it big .
2139,"All of my family members are so much into music, regardless of money or not, they just enjoy doing the music"
2139,you should make your own band
2139,"We should, gosh! why we never thought about it. Thanks that is a great idea."
2139,what kind of band would you be in
2139,"rock, may be. Do you do music too?"
2139,"No, am tone deaf..i fix planes"
2139,that is a hard job!
2139,"yes, but i find it rewarding"
2139,WOW! keep it up!
2139,"Thank you, good luck starting a band"
2140,"No, he doesn't have a membership. His father in-law invited him. He only had one pass available."
2140,"Awesome, how often do you golf?"
2140,I usually get to play once a month. Do you play?
2140,"Yes, I hit the links occasionally. I live in Texas."
2140,"Cool, I've never been to Texas but the Dallas Cowboys are my favorite football team."
2140,"Thats interesting, I am a fan of the Houston Texans."
2140,I'm from Tennessee. Growing up we didn't have a NFL team so I always followed the Cowboys. 
2140,Nice! I like visiting Nashville often.
2140,It's a cool town. Have you ever been to the Smokey Mountains in east Tennessee?
2140,"I have passed through before, I grew up in Virginia."
2140,My husband and I are planning a vacation to Virginia. We want to go to Shenandoah National Park. We love to hike. 
2140,"Shenandoah Mountains are nice, I've never attempted hiking, sounds interesting."
2140,Nice talking to you!
2141,high school is boring
2141,"I know, Not only are the classes useless, but the place is run by Social rejects spending their days grasping for any power they can get"
2141,that is so true. it's like the teachers don't understand students these days. 
2141,Well just as much blame falls on the kids. I see so many high school kids everyday that have less brains than i did when i was 10
2141,oh yeah totally. Everyone is on their phones all day. No one is talking to each other. its one of the main reasons why they dont have social skills
2141,The lack of social skills also makes dating impossible. I can carry on a conversation all day but nobody else knows how to drag their own weight.
2141,The way people meet these days have also changed quite bit specially with all the dating apps 
2141,"But the apps are horrible. There's no one good on them ever, and nobody wants something long term"
2141,"yeah they are mainly for short term. having fun, going out for drinks"
2141,Plus even with the apps you have problem of not knowing who the person actually is until after you spend some time talking to them
2141,The pictures can also be deceiving 
2141,Well if society hadn't messed up women so bad so they would actually make up their minds it'd be one thing. The games are just a waste of time
2142,How is the search going? Im having trouble at work because I am a perfectionist 
2142,Not been fruitful at the moment.
2142,"Im sorry to hear that maybe things will pick up, I hope they do "
2142,I hope so too. you mentioned having troubles at work
2142,"Yes I take a long time to do tasks just because I want them to be perfect, my boss doesnt seem to like that"
2142,"Oh, maybe you should tell your boss about how no one likes him, don't do that i am just kidding"
2142,Yeah thats probably a good way to get fired lol 
2142,Well the good thing is there are more good than bad things with being a perfectionist
2142,"Thats true although it does take me a long time to perform tasks, I even come early into work and leave last "
2142,you'd eventually get by i can feel it
2142,"Thanks for all of your support, I hope the same for you in your quest for a job"
2142,"me too, best of luck!"
2143,yes i learned alot about space
2143,Oh cool.  Do you plan on studying or going into space?
2143,I plan on studying.Would like to go to space some day.
2143,How hard is studying for that field for you?
2143,Its very hard but worth it. Are you studying for anything?
2143,Not anymore.  I stopped to take care of family.  Wish I could go back but probably not enough time now.
2143,Taking care of family is very important. Maybe you still have enough time if its really what you want to do.
2143,I guess so. Gotta keep up the hope.  Meanwhile though how much longer do you have through your program?
2143,I just have one more year to go. Can't wait!
2143,Awesome.  Know what you'll get into after you graduate?
2143,Im not sure yet. Im still undecided. 
2143,I'm sure you'll be great.  Good luck.
2144,"No, I didn't have time. I was rushing to work."
2144,You should make it a weekend project
2144,"That's a good idea, except my husband wanted to go away this weekend."
2144,Where did he want to go?
2144,"I'm not sure, but somewhere close. I hate driving too far. I get car sick."
2144,"Oh that's terrible, I'm sorry to hear that. What would YOU want to do with him?"
2144,I was thinking about renting a cabin somewhere and just relaxing. 
2144,Those are the best ways to spend the weekend sometimes. Personally I like to do stand up on the weekends.
2144,That's fun! When do you perform next? I would like to come see you.
2144,"There's an open mic night this weekend, and then I have a booked gig in two weeks. Honestly, the latter is better."
2144,I'm so proud of you. I'll plan to come see you at the booked gig. Make sure to send me the info.
2144,Awesome. I can do that for sure.
2145,That's a thought. Maybe I should check into that
2145,"You should, it is worth a look!"
2145,I wonder if I could specialize in certain breeds of dogs...that would be different.
2145,I am sure you could
2145,Have you ever thought of going into this field?
2145,I guess no. Have you?
2145,"Yes, but I have a difficult time handling some large dog breeds"
2145,oh yes i can imagine .
2145,Have you dealt much with dogs or cats?
2145,"Yeah i have, i have dogs and cats!"
2145,That's great!  What is your favorite breed of dog?
2145,A big dog that can drag me around when I skate
2146,So what do you like to do in your spare time?
2146,I love cooking tacos are my fav
2146,I like tacos too. Fish tacos are my favorite. 
2146,i just graduated highschool so lost
2146,Do you want to go to college or get a job first?
2146,college would be fun i think
2146,What are interested in studying?
2146,english im great at
2146,Do you like to read?
2146,love it my favorite
2146,that's cool. I'm more of an outdoors person myself. 
2146,love camping as a kidwas fun
2147,Is it a good exercise to do?
2147,It's great exercise. It helps you with balance especially.
2147,Oh thats pretty cool. How long have you been doing it?
2147,For a few years. I play soccer and it's helpful in keeping my core muscles strong.
2147,I may have to give it a try. Is yoga hard to do?
2147,"It seems hard at first, but once you get the hang of it, it isn't bad. Do you exercise regularly?"
2147,I excercise about 3 days a week. Need to start doing it more. 
2147,Three days is better than nothing. What else do you like to do to pass the time?
2147,I like to cook. How about you?
2147,"I like to eat!  Actually, I love to bake but am always dieting. Kind of takes the fun out of it."
2147,Yea that would definitely take the fun out of it. If i bake or cook i want to eat! 
2147,A friend is having a birthday tomorrow and I promised her a German Chocolate Cake. I love the coconut icing!
2147,That sounds delicious! That is my favorite cake!
2147,Have a great day.
2148,I was driving round a roundabout and someone was in the wrong lane!
2148,"That's awful. At least it didn't result in injury or death, as many traffic collisions do"
2148,I am glad it didn't! I was on my way to a civil war reenactment I participate in
2148,That sounds really cool tell me more about that civil war reenactment activity.
2148,"The one I was going to was Gettysburg, its really fun! What do you do for fun?"
2148,"Im kind of boring, not much, I still live with my parents and trying to save money to live by myself "
2148,Nothing boring about that. Do you enjoy travelling?
2148,I love to travel yeah what about yourself?
2148,I love travelling! I fly a lot
2148,that's awesome ! ! have you flown out of the country ?
2148,"Yes, plenty of times. I love flying to europe"
2148,"That sounds really cool, its my dream to visit Europe one day "
2149,I think that it's a real shame that the exploitation of labour still occurs 
2149,"Certainly, and more people should be taught this in school and at work"
2149,"I agree, they should be aware of their own rights."
2149,The problem is finding a way to get employers to see the benefits of paying a fair wage
2149,"I guess this is an issue, inherent with our current mode of production. There will always be a race to the bottom in terms of wages."
2149,"This is why I committed to always paying minimum wage, so that the bottom level is capped at a reasonable rate"
2149,"Yes, without consumers, there is no demand for our products."
2149,I agree. But I am more concerned about the well-being of the workers than I am the generation of new customers. 
2149,"Very true. I guess it's just a reason why paying low wages isn't a smart move, macro-economically."
2149,"I think you're right. So, what are you doing this evening? Anything fun?"
2149,Going to eat some orange gummy bears and relax. What about you.
2149,"Haha, you always are eating those orange gummies! I think I am going to watch a movie and fall asleep on the couch. "
2150,God and my family makes me happy. How about you?
2150,Woww that so nice.The fact that I have to try and save a person is what makes me happy. So you very religious
2150,"Yes, I am religious. I am glad you save peoples lives"
2150,this world could be a safe place if everyone cared for humanity
2150,I agree. God wants us to love our neighbor
2150,God's plan is great....... do you have any hobbies
2150,I really enjoy going to yard sales and thrift stores. I also enjoy reading. How about you?
2150,I love video games and swimming.... I find water relaxing
2150,"Yes, water is relaxing. I also enjoy video games. "
2150,do you spend time with family
2150,Yes. Especially with my kids. How about you?
2150,"not really, my family stay in a different state so I don't oftenly visit them"
2150,Well I hope you can see them soon
2151,I have 3 siblings and we all like classical. do you do anything else?
2151,I like to hike and spend time out in nature. You?
2151,When i get the chance i like to adventure around nature. working on my farm gives me lots of outdoor time
2151,I love farms! Do you own one?
2151,Yeah! I count myself pretty lucky. I love working with animals. What animal is your favorite?
2151,"Difficult choice. I have a dog and two cats, but I love farm animals too. What's your favorite?"
2151,On the farm would be cows. But i think overall it would have to be dogs. what type do you have?
2151,"He's a mixed breed, I have no idea. Cows are great, like big puppies."
2151,They are very friendly animals! not alot of people know or think that.
2151,"They really are. Their size really deceives, they're very sweet."
2151,They can be friendly but also protective. But i suppose all animals and even people can be like that.
2151,"So very true in life, with more than just animals too."
2152,"Extensively. All over Europe, Asia and North America. You?"
2152,"Same! I love Asia, what's your favorite country in Asia?"
2152,I really loved Japan. What about you?
2152,"Just came back from Japan last month, I love it! Where do you plan to travel next?"
2152,"I've always wanted to go to Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania, New Guinea. Planning that trip for next year. You?"
2152,"That sounds fun! I plan on doing Morocco, Spain and Portugal next. "
2152,"Nice! You'll LOVE them. So beautiful. But take some pro-biotics with you, so you don't spend all your time in the loo"
2152,Haha always a good idea. Have you ever travelled with a pet?
2152,"As a matter of fact, yes. Used to take my little sheltie everywhere with me. Bus sadly she passed. Have you?"
2152,"That is so sad. I'm sorry to hear. I have not, mine doesn't even like car rides. But it is sad to leave her for so long"
2152,"Yes, I can't imagine have a pet and not taking it with me. Hope you have a good pet sitter."
2152,We have amazing family members that take her
2153,"Yeah that's true, I just hate being in a retirement home instead of my own home."
2153,"Actually, I think I wouldn't miss all the maintenance that goes with home ownership as I get older."
2153,"That's a good point too, I mean my family was helping with that."
2153,"When my parents divorced, my mom moved into a retirement home and she loves it. There's always someone to chat with."
2153,Oh that's great to hear! I agree the people can be great.
2153,"I've already decided I'm going to sell my home and rent, just for that reason. I don't like being isolated."
2153,"Good plan, socializing and keeping active is important."
2153,"Yes, I thought I would enjoy home ownership just because, historically speaking, it's what Americans strive for. But I'm ready for something different!"
2153,Do you like to travel? Do you want to live in a city?
2153,"I love to travel! I want to live in a medium size town, not a metropolis. I love stores, but not horrible traffic. How about you?"
2153,"I'm the same, I don't like to be in the big cities, but I don't want to be isolated either. Travel is the best."
2153,"Yes, I love history, so traveling to places I've studied and read about has been a blast."
2154,I'm sorry for your loss also. 
2154,"Thanks, it was difficult to accept for a long time. It makes me think about my own mortality, and about the things I want to do before I die...like skydiving!"
2154,That would be awesome! I'd love to try it out. How much does it cost?!
2154,"My friends went and it cost somewhere around $300 or $350. It is expensive, but I think it will be worth it. "
2154,Sounds like a good investment to me haha! Where about are you from?
2154,"I was born in Morocco, but now I am living in Harlem. We moved here when I was very young. What about you?"
2154,"That's awesome. I live in California, been here my whole life."
2154,That's cool! I have some cousins that live in the Bay area. What sort of work are you doing there?
2154,I'm working at a power plant. It's exciting at times but others mostly dull and boring. Yourself?
2154,I just finished my Masters degree and I am starting an internship with an engineering firm soon. 
2154,"Sounds like hard work, how are you finding it?"
2154,"I haven't started yet at the internship, but I don't think it will be too bad. University was a breeze, so this shouldn't be any different, right?"
2155,Thanks! appreciate it
2155,You too! Thanks!
2155,"They really caught me off guard, had no idea they were planning anything. Nice surprise to say the least"
2155,They definitely surprised you then!
2155,"Indeed, what's new with you? The family is doing well?"
2155,I recently had a child and my marriage is thriving!
2155,"Wow congratulations! Our collie keeps us busy enough, can't imagine adding a child to the mix at this point. How do you like being a parent?"
2155,busy ! work was crazy as always . it work never ends !
2155,"Tell me about it. I can't even find time to snack lately, and you know I love snacking!"
2155,Oh I do love snacking! Have you ate anything interesting?
2155,"I just had some Bamba, it's an Israeli corn puff snack. Delicious. I can eat a whole giant bag of that easily. "
2155,That sounds really good! 
2156,they are! i wonder how the japanese make their tacos?
2156,It's specific to Japan. I bet it's a kind of beef
2156,this last summer- i went to japan. beautiful country!
2156,I've always wanted to go there! What did you like most about it?
2156,the people! theyre great! did you know they have sports there?
2156,"Okay cool, I'm not that big into sports."
2156,i love hockey but thats it. what do you like?
2156,I don't really like any sports.
2156,ii meant- besides sports
2156,I like to hike.
2156,oh me too! ive hiked many beautiful places
2156,What mountains did you visit?
2157,how nice that sound.
2157,"It's the heaven to my ears and the sparkle to my stars, the color blue is, indeed. "
2157,blue is my favorite colors. 
2157,"Mine too, but I also enjoy many other colors, depending on my mood and the vibes of my surroundings. How about you?"
2157,yes me too. i love other color as well but no better color than the color of blue.
2157,"Yes, it tantalizes us with the depth of the ocean, and makes us consider the possibilities when we look up. "
2157,"Blue, blue, my world is blue Blue is my world now I'm without you Gray, gray, my life is gray Cold is my heart since you went away."
2157,"That's really deep, did you write that or are those lyrics quoted from a song?"
2157,"yes i did. Red, red, my eyes are red Crying for you alone in my bed Green, green, my jealous heart I doubted you and now we're apart"
2157,"You have quite a lot of talent, I'm impressed; you should consider writing professionally."
2157,thank you 
2157,"You're welcome. I wish I could write that well, but being an Italian American, I've grown up to become a paver and know nothing else. "
2158,I am a much better hunter than I am an artist.  I once shot a lion in Africa.
2158,"I have not been to Africa, but if I did go it would be to the Ivory Coast, aka the Cote d'Ivoire."
2158,"I have been to South Africa, but never the Ivory Coast.  I hear it is beautiful."
2158,"I agrrew, I would love to go to see The Caribeans next year."
2158,I love to travel.  Where is the most exotic place you have been?
2158,Well I use to live in Las Vegas dont know if that count as exotic.
2158,I guess it depends on where in Vegas. :)  
2158,"True, Well the desert is my favorite I guess thats exotic huh, loll."
2158,I think the Red Rock Canyon west of Vegas is exotic.  I have spend a few nights there.  Have you ever been?  
2158,"Yeah, I actually loved to see that view one of my favorite."
2158,"Since you lived there, do you know any cool places around Vegas that are not too touristy?  "
2158,"Yea, I would have to say mostly locals go to Freemont."
2159,Sure - I'll beam it over. lol Do you brew?
2159,I absolutely do! I have a bottle of beer that I'm drinking as we speak.
2159,did you brew it or buy it?
2159,i bought it 
2159,"ah, I see. domestic or import?"
2159,i prefer a domestic brand
2159,what's your fav?
2159,Always been a fan of Corona though lately I've been chugging Hurricanes and Keystones
2159,"Corona's a good import. I prefer imports. My favorite has long been Heineken, ever since I visited the brewery in Germany."
2159,very cool i will have to meet up and buy you a beer
2159,or come over for some of my home brew
2159,sounds like a good diea
2160,I'm a great watercolor painter but a terrible artist LOL
2160,That is interesting.  My big think is drawing. I use a blue pencil to do a lot of it.
2160,My career was in graphic design and I used those blue pencils a lot. What kind of drawing u do?
2160,Generally scenic stuff.  Outdoors and the like.  The blue color makes them noticeable.
2160,I do scenic in watercolors too. Is drawing your job?
2160,"No, it is just something I have enjoyed since I was a kid."
2160,What part of the world you live in?
2160,The southern USA.  Summer just ended a couple of days ago.  A little nip in the air.
2160,I'm in Florida. Yesterday we had a very cool day. At least it doesnt snow here lol.
2160,I moved from the Massachusetts after the blizzard of 1977. I had enough of snow
2160,"Been here 84-2010, then back in 2017. Couldnt take it either lol"
2160,"After it snowed all night, I opened my door to a snow bank.  Couldn't get out for 3 days."
2161,I don't really watch a lot of TV to be honest.  Do you like video games?
2161,"Yes, I play a lot of them! How about you?"
2161,"Absolutely!  My favorite is Minecraft, I've been on the server I play on for about a year now.  What game is your favorite?"
2161,"That's awesome, I've heard it's a good game! Probably Breath of the Wild, for the Switch! Have you ever played it?"
2161,I wish...I've wanted a switch since it came out.  I really want to get one at least before Animal Crossing comes out next year.
2161,"I hope you can soon :)! Oh, you like animal crossing! Do you ever play Animal Crossing Pocket Camp?"
2161,"I did!!! It's been a couple years since I played, maybe I should rejoin it again."
2161,For sure! What other kinds of games do you like? 
2161,Katamari Damacy is another favorite.  I actually bought Play Station Now for a month just so I could play it.  Have you ever played it?
2161,"No, but it looks really fun! That's awesome, some of the older games for play station are so good. "
2161,"They are!  My boyfriend's kid introduced me to Spelunky, that was a lot of fun too.  They have Katamari for mobile, check it out sometime."
2161,"That sounds really fun, thanks! I'll definitely try the app out. "
2162,That's excellent. I enjoy a nomadic lifestyle.
2162,"I envy you, but, I had to put down roots because I have 12 babies and roaming isn't a good way to raise them."
2162,"I have 3 babies myself. We all trave together. It's the work my wife and I enjoy, and we can do it together/"
2162,"Okay, that sounds awesome. Do you live in a rv or travel trailer?"
2162,We modified a school bus into an rv.
2162,that is beautiful ! i would love to do so myself one day .
2162,My eldest daughter graduated at the top of her class. We let her plan the design of the bus.
2162,Wow! I am impressed! Is she planning on pursuing design or engineering?
2162,"Yes indeed, I think she will do a fine job. How old are your kids?"
2162,They range from 2 to almost 30. And a couple grandbabies thrown in the mix!
2162,That sounds like a life full of great adventures. I am happy for you.
2162,Mine is boring compared to yours! 
2163,What are some of your favorite television shows?
2163,"I love Game of Thrones. Too bad the ending is not too great, I think."
2163,I have hear that a lot! Do you have any children?
2163,"Yes, 2 kids. I grew up with my brothers so I am hoping for a big family as well. How about you?"
2163,"Yes, I have two children as well. Are your children into sports?"
2163,"No, they are more into music than sports. I have a dream when i was young to go to Spain and study music there. "
2163,That would be wonderful! My daughter plays the violin and I would love to learn myself.
2163,My kids play piano and violin. I think music is so relaxing and comforting.
2163,It sure is! What is your favorite type of music?
2163,"my favorite is classical , how about you?"
2163,I like jazz and I try to go see live performances as much as I can.
2163,Jazz is so beautiful and soothing the classical music sound is great do you often go to jazz clubs?
2164,yes and ready to mingle lol
2164,Do you like apple martinis?
2164,yeah i love it
2164,Me too. So how old are you?
2164,32 and you
2164,I am 30. Do you go out much?
2164,yeah i go to night clubs alot
2164,Clubs are great! Which ones do you go to?
2164,i stay in las vegas so there alot of them there not sure if you know any
2164,Vegas is great. I have only been once but would love to go back.
2164,Yep the strip is where i hang out mostly love it there
2164,Do you go see the shows much?
2165,Somedays are better than others but ultimately I have to have my scotch.
2165,Im sorry. Hopefully you can get through that.
2165,"Me too and I downsized my house to spend more on alcohol, do you have any ideas to help?"
2165,You need to find AA meetings. Do you like steak? Mine has to be well done.
2165,"Great idea thanks I will find one. Oh my gosh yes love me a steak but I can do medium, do you like Kobe Steak"
2165,I do! Im having steak for dinner tonight. Maybe try to get your mind on other things besides drinking? Like cooking!
2165,"Lucky you lol. Well the steaks in my area are expensive, how much do you pay for a nice T bone"
2165,Around $10. My job is a roofer I work hard so I treat myself sometimes
2165,Nice and keep up the good work you deserve it. We just had tornados in our city and need roofers bad!
2165,Oh Im sorry!
2165,Yes we are starting the relief efforts and helping all we can. It was a scary night
2165,One year we had one hit a school in Moore and a few children died. It was so devastating. I hate tornados so much.
2166,"Yes, I flinched it's true."
2166,"I absolutely love squirrels, I wrote a song about them."
2166,That's awesome. Do you perform them as well?
2166,"I do, I do live performances on TV for the BBC,"
2166,That is an awesome way to pass the time. I used to do stand up while at Princeton. I probably used a squirrel joke.
2166,Did you use to be a professional comic? I sometimes have comics as my opening act.
2166,Maybe semiprofessional. I do an act at the local pub or comedy shop.
2166,"That is very fun, stage work can be very rewarding."
2166,"Yes, it can. Life is a reward. "
2166,Truly! Finding your talent and your own form of art is one of the best things about life.
2166,"Quite right you are. I spend time with family, on the stage, and at many museums. "
2166,I love museums as well. What is your favorite type of museum?
2167,it absolutely did. i dont think i'll be drinking milk for a while
2167,"Well, I am pretty sure you learnt a lesson."
2167,lol sure did. at least i got out of work a little early
2167,"Well, at least you are looking at the bright side"
2167,"always! i work all the time anyways, so even if i'm a little ill at my own fault i sill get a nap"
2167,"Well, that's not easy habit. For me at least it is not. Lol"
2167,"nap time should be mandatory, not just for kids. 40hrs a work week. once you add kids it turns into 120+ real quick "
2167,"Well, I am an night owl, I do not think I can change the way I see it"
2167,what is it that you do?
2167,I work the night shift in a clothing factory. And you?
2167,computer science research for a medical lab
2167,"That's pretty impressive, to be honest."
2168,do you have an indoor or outdoor grill
2168,"I used to have a George Foreman grill, but when I moved, I lost it.  I really loved it though. "
2168,how can you lose a big item such as a gril
2168,"Its a funny story, actually.  It was in one of the boxes, and it fell off of the moving truck, and we never found it. "
2169,"yeah, she might be a stalker - lol"
2169,haha probably is. be careful. do you like cats or dogs?
2169,neither - they both stink up the house and get hair everywhere. You?
2169,I love dogs! It does take work to clean them though.
2169,I had one growing up. got her when I was four and had her till she passed when I was 16. great dog
2169,I have four dogs lol. Im that person who will see one on the side of the road and pick it up. lol
2169,wow! you must have a LOT of energy. Are they all mixed breeds? 
2169,"yes, i spend most of my time with them! im a dog trainer too"
2169,"ah, nice. at least you have well trained dogs. what's your favorite pet trick?"
2169,My dog Susie can fetch a soda from the fridge lol
2169,love it! great trick!!
2169,haha thanks!
2170,"Wow, that sounds scary. Were you injured?"
2170,I wasn't but sometimes I think I'm too tall to participate in some sports.
2170,I hear ya! I am pretty tall myself and it can be awkward!
2170,Have you tried to waterski
2170,"Yes, and it did not go well. I have only done it once, and probably won't try again!"
2170,I think I will stick to driving the boat
2170,I agree! I have a boat and I really enjoy taking it out on the lake near my house.
2170,What do you like to do on the lake?
2170,"Just being out on the open water is great, but my boys love to fish so we do that al lot."
2170,Sounds nice and relaxing
2170,"It really is, but boats are SO expensive to maintain."
2170,I think It's worth it though. 
2171,I can't understand a lot of the lyrics these days either. It kind of sounds like the artist is whining!
2171,"Same, it's all whinning and half the lyrics don't make sense anyway."
2171,I still like when a Biggie or Tupac song comes on though! 
2171,"Oh yeah, bring back early 90's rap, not this soundcloud stuff!"
2171,"Exactly! So much autotune, right?"
2171,"It's all autotune, teens being entitled and bragging, really bugs me!"
2171,They are very entitled for sure! The emphasis on consumption reminds me of the 80s.
2171,I think it's worse now and it's such a bad influence on kids.
2171,"Yes, and they are so hooked to media and glued to screens, can't be good at all."
2171,I still find it crazy seeing such young kids knowing how to work phones and tablets! 
2171,"You see toddlers on ipads, downloading apps. It's crazy!"
2171,It's so crazy that their parents let them sit there and download apps! 
2171,The new pacifier! 
2172,Hmmm I haven't either so I googled it apparently it's a type of fish!
2172,"Yeah, They are often called moonfish or sunfish. They look great. its the one i catch most at the creek when fishing"
2172,Seems like there was a lot of recipes have you ever eaten some?
2172,"Yes I have, it is delicious! Fish pie and a cold beer. Its hard to beat. you should try it."
2172,I definitely will! I grew up by the ocean so I do love fish! 
2172,i love eating everything i sea too. I love being by the sea. So relazing
2172,Yes I completely agree! Watching the sun set on the horizon never gets old.
2172,agree . beautiful . seeing it in person there's no replacement for that . you cant capture a moment like that
2172,Nope and no matter how hard you try to capture it in a photo it's never the same.
2172,There is a creek nearby here. Fishing at the creek with a beer is the best
2172,That seems very peaceful I bet the sound of the water is so relaxing. 
2172,It is - especially in the sunshine. Although being beside the ocean would be moreso. Are you there often?
2172,No unfortunately I don't live by the ocean any longer but we have a bunch of lakes so at least I'm not completely deprived!
2173,What did you do there
2173,I was being a savage it haunts me what i did
2173,Can't be worse than living in a foreign car in Los Angeles. It's pretty Savage out there.
2173,yeah that seems pretty crazy
2173,I keep hoping I'll find my prince and he will rescue me from my despair 
2173,I have always imagined and wished the same
2173,Oh to have a fairytale ending where we live happily ever after. 
2173,that would be such a good ending
2173,Riding off into the sunset. Savages are we? LOL
2173,haha savage until the end right
2173,Yep. Who knows what the future might bring. 
2173,I hope alot of great things
2174,I overslept and then my car wouldnt start
2174,"Man that's awful, I'm sorry. I hope you're able to get it fixed, and soon!"
2174,"Yes, I had my son come and replace the battery. Hows your day?"
2174,"my day was good , but busy ! what about you ?"
2174,"Other than those 2 things, the rest of the day has been smooth sailing."
2174,"Glad to hear it, I hope I have a day like that soon."
2174,I hope you do also. What made your day busy?
2174,I had so much work to do.
2174,Did you get it all done>
2174,Yes I got it all finished thankfully
2174,Thats great
2174,"yes it is , it took a lot of work . so what else do you like ?"
2175,That is a great job and I love animals too. Do you like to bake?
2175,I do love bake! Do you? 
2175,"Oh my yes, and my family owns a restaurant so I get tons of experience. What is your favorite sweet "
2175,Olives! And all the vegetables.
2175,"Lol, nice those are great to especially in a salad. What will you have for lunch today?"
2175,Salad and garlic bread! How about you?
2175,Yummy that sounds good. I am baking a macaroni casserole which I will display in my bakery one day.
2175,That sounds really good! Best of luck! 
2175,Thanks I will sure need it. Have you ever thought of opening a business?
2175,I have just haven't taken the opportunity yet 
2175,It is very stressful so far and not sure if the risk will meet the reward. 
2175,Sometimes it is worth taking a risk like that to have a high reward.
2176,I need to find some warm clothes for winter
2176,Shopping is fun!  What do you plan on getting?
2176,"I am the opposite, I dont find shopping fun. So just some sweaters to start "
2176,Understandable! I personally will wear anything that is practical and fashionable
2176,"Sounds like I need to go shopping with you, so that you can teach me"
2176,I think shopping should be more of a personal experience than a guided one
2176,We are definitely opposites. Lol. I don't mind being guided
2176,so what else do you like besides going to the mall ? 
2176,"I am a stay at home mom, so my life basically revolves around my kids"
2176,"that sounds like a lot of responsibility , however kids are your life "
2176,It is a lot of responsibility but I love it. How about you?
2176,"My kids are my two cats , milo and fio. I love them"
2177,What kind of music do you like? I love rock opera and two steps from hell!
2177,i prefer rock from the 90s era. Some could call it alternative
2177,"Ohhhh I like that, too! I need some gummy worms! Craving sweets too hard right now!"
2177,"Indeed, I enjoy the sour gummy worms. My german shepard likes to steal them."
2177,"He sounds like a brat! And very, very spoiled! My cats try to attack them."
2177,Haha my cats are too lazy to attack anything. They are so rested.
2177,Mine have been running like idiots through the house this morning. And being really loud!
2177,There is nothing like cat nip and a laser pen.
2177,I'll have to try that! Any holiday plans yet? I may get a teeny prelit tree and call it even.
2177,"Not yet. My Christmas is routine. Three gets together, and then Christmas morning at my house."
2177,I live alone so it's just me and the cats-yeah I am the stereotypical crazy cat lady lolol!
2177,The world wouldn't be the same without crazy cat ladies. I applaud you.
2177,Awwww thank you! Have a wonderful day and make tons of money!

2178,Congrats.....that is exciting.  Is this her first child?
2178,Yes! First child! It's given me new inspiration for my writing too which is good!
2178,Oh great.   What do you like to write about?
2178,Just normal things that happen in my life...so the bus story is a good one!
2178,"Yes, real life is often stranger than fiction.   "
2179,"LOL me too, sometimes I eat that after I'm done swimming. "
2179,That's a good idea. Since swimming after you eat can make you feel nausea.
2179,What do you do for fun?
2179,I play video games with some friends. Gotta get that fun in! 
2179,That's cool! I like travelling a lot.

2179,Yeah it's exciting some times and dull other times. Where are you from?
2179,New York.. how about you?
2179,I'm from California! Couldn't live in New York. Not enough lakes for me to swim in!
2179,I know it is expensive in California. As a nurse I would struggle maybe

2180,"I'm not good either, though I still love it. Do you like to dance?"
2180,Sometimes. What do you like to dance to?

2182,"Yes it is, we should have called the police"
2182,"I'd say calling the police might be a little too far, but I would definitely encourage your wife to keep her distance at least! "
2182,Did you see it happen?
2182,I didn't but I heard the commotion after it happened. It did not sound pretty.
2182,It was just a little disrespectful 
2182,It was very disrespectful. People shouldn't have to worry about things like that happening to them in their own neighborhood.
2182,"That is very true, I am just still very upset. How would you take it?"
2182,Well if I had a partner and this happened I would be pretty upset still too. I think talking to them might help.
2183,rap and pop 
2183,I don't like rap music.
2183,why dont you like rap
2183,It just gives me a headache and most of the time I cannot understand what is being said.

2190,"Yeah, Glasses have come a long way and are very stylish nowadays"

2190,"I only have four pair but I do have them in silver, gold, red, and sunglasses"

2190,That sounds really nice. I'm sure you can find a lot of different styles in turquoise.
2190,"What style do you like, round, square, frameless?"

2191,"Hey I'm very similar in that regards! Dogs are awesome, what do you like to do on the weekend"
2191,I usually go to the dog park. But sometimes I go to the movies. Have you seen any good movies lately?
2191,"Yea I saw that new Joker movie, it was pretty good, but I'm more a music person, I especially like rage metal genre of music. What about you"
2191,I saw Joker too. It's pretty dark but had a great performance. I like classic rock. 
2191,Any upcoming movie you're interested in seeing? I'm looking forward to the new Star Wars movie.
2192,I like baseball the most. Nascar isn't too bad either.
2192,Baseball is fun to play for sure! We play all the time especial catch at the beach. 
2192,I love going to the beach. Do you have a favorite beach?
2192,"Oh yes, Panama City is our favorite and I wish I could own a house there someday."

2192,"Me and you both. I am already hungry for lunch maybe some fast food, do you have any ideas?"
2192,I would recommend Chick Fila if you have them. Now I'm hungry
2192,"Oh that is my all time favorite of course now, but Mcdonalds use to be the top spot."
2192,I get my kids Mcdonalds occasionally since it is way cheaper. Have you had the new Popeyes chicken sandwich?
2192,Exactly me too and there is something about the cravings of certain food that makes me want to stop for a quick fix
2192,I agree. So much easier than cooking at home. Not as healthy though.
2192,"Either Popeyes, Mcdonalds or Chick Fil A, they all will suffice for speed of service!"
2193,I love purple it's my favorite
2193,Me too!  So does my daughter and my mother.
2193,I always wear purple when I go to my favorite band Worn's concerts.

2193,"If you like him, I bet you would like Gov't Mule"
2193,I will have to look them up.  Is that how it is spelled?
2193,"Yes, it's spelled exactly that way. When you find them, listen to Beautifully Broken. It's my fave."

2194,"Oh wow, that sounds delicious. I will have to try that sometime soon!"
2194,It's my favorite ice cream. Do you have a favorite?
2194,I love birthday cake ice cream. The one that has cake pieces and frosting swirls. It is so good!
2194,That sounds amazing. It makes me kind of hungry to think about it.
2194,"I know! Now I want some. But I'll have to wait until Friday. I am only working part time right now, so money is tight."
2194,I can understand that. What do you do for work?
2194,I am a home care nurse. So I visit people in their homes and help with medications and what not. What about you?
2194,"I've developed a cure for the common cold. So, I guess I'm mostly a scientist."
2194,Well isn't that amazing! Nice chatting with you. Have a good one. 
2195,you'er probably right. it's still a bummer 
2195,I know :/ ...just make sure you do something fun when you have a chance!

2195,i'd rather watch then participate. i am more into puzzles 
2195,what kind of puzzles you love

2196,"I'm in Arkansas too, Fayetteville. What a coincidence!"
2196,Yeah I know right!  So you do Amazon Turk too?  Do you like it?
2196,"I do like it, I've gotten some decent quals. I moved away for 12 years and then I moved back."
2196,Wow.  Yeah it helps me earn some extra spending money.  I live in Batesville actually.  What mad you move away?
2196,My job transferred to St Louis. I'm now living on the same street where I lived my wild childhood. 
2196,Oh I see.  That is very interesting.  I have moved all over the place but always stay close to family.
2196,My street was way out in the country when I was a kid but Fayetteville grew up around it. 
2196,Are you a HOGS fan?
2196,"Oh yes, my heart keeps on getting broken, what about you?"
2196,Yes mine too!  It is terrible.  I just love them and wonder what will happen to them.
2197,"buffalo, ever been there?"
2197,"No, I have never been that far north. Is it cold up there? "
2197,"yeah, I love snow"
2197,I have been in the snow but I hate it. How cold is it up there right now? 
2197,57 and rain in the forecast
2197,That's not too bad. It is in the 70s here and it looks like it might rain

2198,"Yes, it is one of the most popular fishing shows on the planet. A great choice."
2198,Any other shows you can recommend? 
2198,"Yes, that would be Chasing Monsters – Adventurer Cyril Chauquet seeks out the most colossal and dangerous underwater creatures around the world in this adrenaline-packed series."
2198,I love that show! What is you're personal favorite? 
2198,"Probably ""Monster fish"" - where biologist Zeb Hogan travels the globe in search of the biggest, fiercest fresh water fish."
2198,I will have to watch that one.
2198,"Yes, please do. There is a whole sea of options out there today when it comes to finding great fishing shows online (pun semi-intended)."
2199,That is so lucky. I get to market for homes all around the world as well.

2199,No me neither and since I was an only child I get to dedicate a lot of time to work. 
2199,Do you tend to have a lot of work?
2199,"I love to work and can't wait for the next challenge, of course after two cups of coffee! Do you drink coffee?"
2199,"i drink it occasionally , but i prefer tea with milk and sugar . how about you ?"
2199,"Oh that sounds great as well! I have not tried it yet, do you have any brand recommendations?"
2199,"Tazo is a good brand, my cats love it"
2199,"Lol, oh my cats would go bonkers if they had any caffeine I am sure. How many do you have?"
2199,"I have 3 cats, they make is super difficult when it's dinner time, I love to eat tacos, but they always try to get them"
2200,"Yes, more annoying when they don't get everything they want"
2200,I can only imagine. I teach violin and viola lessons to kids sometimes and it can be a challenge
2200,That sounds like a nice job. Are you into fitness? I typically run about 2 miles a day.
2200,I am! I play a lot of tennis and I am actually running a half marathon this weekend
2200,Oh nice! I love tennis! I played football in college so I'm a little worn down from that.
2200,That's cool. Do you keep up with football as a fan? Now that you're out of college?
2200,I watch it from time to time. Not as much since the kids play sports. Do you have kids?
2200,I have a son. He's only 4 1/2 so we haven't fully been immersed in the world of kid's sports yet. He's starting basketball this year
2200,That's a fun age. It's good to keep them active and off of all the electronics
2200,Agreed! He's all about being outside right now and we are fully embracing that while it lasts :). How old are your kids?
2200,"I have 3 boys. 13, 14 and 18. Definitely keep him outside as much as you can. Good exercise for everyone."
2200,Wow! I bet your house is full of energy :)
2201,I would love to be a cook I think. I make a fantastic meatloaf!
2201,"I love meatloaf! I'm a crappy cook, though. What's your favorite holiday dish to cook? "
2201,"Hmm, favorite holiday dish. Honestly I love to make different holiday candies and cookies to nibble on throughout the month. Just gotta keep them away from my doggie though!"
2201,"I love cookie dough! I love always sweets, but chocolate is my favorite. Who's getting into your cookie dough? The kids? "
2201,"My dog, Toto. He loves to eat human food even though some of it makes him sick. "
2201,Awww... The poor baby. I have a cat. He's always laying on the homework I'm trying to grade. 
2201,"Oh cool, I assume you're a teacher? What do you teach?"
2201,"I teach third grade. They're rowdy, but I love my job. "
2201,"I used to teach kindergarten but the school I worked at sadly had to close their doors, which is why I'm out of a job currently."
2201,I'm sorry. It's sad that so many schools are closing these days. Kids need safe places to learn inside their neighborhoods.
2201,I definitely agree. I love teaching but sometimes I'd like to explore other options. 
2201,That's always a good thing. Are you thinking of going back to college? 
2202,I am a program director. Do you enjoy new technology?
2202,"I do enjoy new technology very much, especially as a health care provider. "
2202,"That is great to hear, I am very partial to I Phone and its components...more so than Samsung. How about you?"
2202,"I have always been partial to Apple, so I am used to their platform for sure. I prefer the iphone over Samsung!"
2202,What about Apple brands advancements in the technology world has had you most excited?
2202,I think innovation is their strong suit. They are always pushing the boundaries.
2202,"Absolutely, I can only imagine what they will come up with. Is it true that they are launching a phone that you can bend?"
2202,That would be awesome it they did! Materials these days are getting so much more advanced. 
2202,Indeed...sometimes they seem from out of this world. Since my wife left I have plenty of extra spending money for cool gadgets.
2202,"I'm sorry to hear your wife left. At least gadgets are fun, distracting, and won't break your heart!"
2203,I am in the United States. I would like to travel but don'
2203,Where would you like to travel if you had more time? Within your own country or internationally?
2203,I would like to work for National Geographic and take photos around the world. What about you?
2203,"I would like to travel somewhere cold, maybe Alaska. What do you do for fun?"
2203,I don't have fun ever since my wife died. I'm all alone. 
2203,I'm sorry to hear that. I've lost people in my life too. I hope you find or have found peace. What do you do for work?
2203,I'm unemployed and do Mturk to pay my bills. I miss my wife.
2203,I think picking up a hobby would be nice to help you out. When I encountered difficult times I play guitar. I also like to cook too.
2203,"That sounds productive and beneficial, forgive my negativity. I'm just being facetious. I'm all out of prompt."
2203,It's no problem! Do you have any favorite foods?
2203,"If I could travel to other countries like South Korea, I would like to try new things like Kimchi, or real Japanese sushi. You?"
2203,I like USA southern food. I also like seafood a lot! Sushi is good too. I like salmon sushi. What is your favorite sushi?
2204,I did wait a while to go back to school after leaving for a year.
2204,"There's still some time left to make the most of it, isn't there?"
2204,"There is plenty of time, yes. After I get a good job I want to save up for a corvette when I retire."
2204,I'm not lying but I've owned 7 corvettes when I was younger lol. Once I had 3 at one time lol.
2204,That's awesome. I want to own a corvette and a hundred dogs. I love dogs and want to open up a shelter for abused dogs.
2204,"I've had 14 dogs, mostly doxies. Since we like vettes and dogs, maybe we should get together LOL!"
2204,Maybe this is fate! 
2204,I hope you get all you want! I was in dog rescue myself and it's a very loving thing.
2204,That's amazing was it a big rescue center?
2204,"No, it was a local dachshund rescue but we still had about 10 foster families and got dogs all the time."
2204,My grandfather used to have a dachshund. Great little dogs. 
2204,Best of luck to you! Don't give up your dreams!
2205,Yeah I have a dog and there is an outdoor cat that hangs around our neighborhood. What about you?
2205,no pets - my love is music - I play violin - you play or sing?
2205,"Yeah I play guitar, banjo and harmonica but not so much lately "
2205,ever compete?
2205,No I'm not that good. I just play for my own enjoyment
2205,"yeah, it is enjoyable. ever perform?"
2205,No but I will jam with other people sometimes. 
2205,that's fun. I love doing that. do you have a lot of friends who play?
2205,Some of them do. How long have you been playing violin? 
2205,since I was 2
2205,Wow you were practically born to play violin. So do you play in an orchestra?
2205,"yeah - my mom teaches, so I couldn't wait to get my hands on one. No to the orchestra. I'm a soloist."
2206,Mashed potatoes are my favorite. I eat plenty of them since I'm vegan.
2206,"They are quite yummy! Our Thanksgiving routine is to hang out, eat the traditional spread including LOTS of mashed potatoes, and play chess afterwards for a few hours."
2206,Ours is the same but replace chess with watching football. What kind of pies do you make.
2206,Pecan pie is the crowd favorite here! We normally make peanut butter pie as well but that's more of a cheescake thing.
2206,"that sounds great, I make a pumpkin cheesecake sometimes."
2206,I don't think I've ever had that! It sounds pretty yummy though! How does Vegan cheesecake work?
2206,"there's vegan cream cheese, I think it's made from tofu but I still do regular food for the extended family"
2206,Interesting! I had no idea. I might have to look into  it since I've got a cousin who's vegan and it might make for a good surprise.
2206,I don't know why not having animal products in things make them so expensive
2206,"Smaller, specialty market I suppose! It's cheaper when you just crank out the same recipe a million times. "
2206,You're right. I don't have many grocery stores near me so I have to make my Whole Foods trips count
2206,I live in the suburbs so I have to choose between Walmart (yuck) or making a trip to town. Whole Foods is so expensive too!
2207,What will make you pissed?
2207,It would take a lot but I suppose if my dog ran away that would make me upset too. 
2207,Exactly.... that was what make me pissed off because my dog ran away 
2207,Did you find your dog?
2207,I can't find because i don't no where exactly he is now
2207,I'm sorry to hear that. Have you put up any posters?
2207,Yeah.... i done that already.... Anybody found my dog their is a gift for the person 
2207,What is the gift?
2207,Am gonna give the person $50
2207,That's a good gift. What kind of dog is it?
2207,Is a Barbet dog black in color 
2207,I have never heard of that breed. How big is it?

2208,"wow , that's pretty young !"
2208,yes and he's such a handful! hahah
2208,"I am sure you're a great parent! So, you enjoy music?"
2208,thank you! yes I love music I used to play clarinet. how about you?
2208,"I play guitar and bass, started with piano!"
2209,My favorite color is blue.
2209,That's a great color
2209,What do you want to do for a career?
2209,i am not sure yet . maybe some type of engineering
2209,"Nice, engineering seems interesting but not for me."
2209,yeah you pretty much have to have a degree to do that . do you have pets ?
2209,I unfortunately do not. How about you?
2209,I have no pets currently no.
2209,Would you like to get one?
2209,"I thought about it, but dont think I could handle one. Do you have one?"
2209,I would like to get a dog.
2209,Dogs are cool. I started a new job recently. Do you have a job?
2210,"I would have spent my whole summer there if I could, two weeks was too short"
2210,I would love to visit there in the near future. How could you not love all that the county has to offer!
2210,"the pastries were amazing, what is your favorite Italian food?"
2210,"Does Gelato count as a food? Lol, I love Fettuccine Alfredo and Spaghetti Bolognase"
2210,"Gelato is definately food. I'm glad I live in a big city, we have some decent gelato places "
2210,"How about the wine there, did you visit any Vineyards?"
2210,"There are some nearby, I keep meaning to go but haven't gotten around to it. "
2210,"I understand wine making there goes back many generations! I had a small part in a movie, filmed in Italy that involved a family wine business"
2210,"That's cool, did you get paid to do it?"
2210,"I did, but not much..I had a small speaking part as a neighbor. Hopefully I'll get larger parts in the future. What do you do?"
2210,do you speak Italiian?
2210,"I have always been interested in the language, and started studying it online for a bit."
2211,"Yes, I work in IT. I run marathons in my spare time. Do you like fitness?"
2211,That's pretty awesome. Do you usually run marathons?
2211,Occasionally. I prefer to lift weights though.
2211,Are there any big marathons near where you are?
2211,The biggest within driving range is the New York City one but I haven't run that one yet.
2211,Which was the longest you participated?
2211,There are a few different ones. What are your hobbies?
2211,"I like to spend time with my family, and I organize parties as well."
2211,Nice. Family is so important. I do enjoy a good party. 
2211,"They are great, what is your favorite music?"
2211,I enjoy Alternative and some country. What about you?
2211,"I like pop music, and I do enjoy some rock, it is pretty great for certain occasions."
2211,"Oh yeah, I also like some pop music when I'm running."
2211,"Great! By the way, I need to go. See you later!"
2212,What is the most useful purpose they serve now?
2212,"Since they are highly trainable, they are often used for disability assistance, search-and-rescue, as well as police and military jobs."
2212,That is great! Is it cost effective to spend the time training them for these activities?
2212,"Of course, but unavoiable.  Death is not really the concern, but dying."
2212,I believe working with horses is a very notable activity that is not praised enough.
2212,Absolutely!  Is there anything you're personally passionate about?
2212,I actually work with people with disabilities too using animals. I am very passionate about this activity.
2212,My daughter is thinking about that career track.  Is it hard though when an animal doesn't make it?
2212,"Not really, If the animal is unsuited for this purpose it can always be used as a house pet for a household. "
2212,"Well, that's great to hear.  Is it pretty easy to find a permanent home for them at that point?"
2212,It very easy to give these to people. Always a needy family looking.
2212,That is very nice of you to help those that are needy.
2213,credit card bahasa? what is that?
2213,"I have a Chase credit card. They really aren't that great, but I do hope you get approved. Why do you need it?"
2213,The Chase credit card offers me 2% cash back on any grocery shopping bill. It gives me benefit considered that I don't have a permanent job
2213,Yeah I didn't think about that. Could see some benefit there..
2213,"Sure, you need to get one. About grocery shopping, I started to limit how much I eat. I joined loss weight program"
2213,"wow that's amazing ! i wish i could do that myself , could help my diet"
2213,Absolutely! Do you want me to explain the program to you?
2213,"Sure, I need to lose weight so I look good for my future trip to Ireland. Or Puerto Rico"
2213,"Eat protein, fat and vegetables only 20 to 50 gram daily. Future trip to Ireland or Puerto Rico, that would be an awesome trip."
2213,I would love to visit Puerto Vallarta! It is a Mexican beach resort city on the Pacific Ocean's Bahia de Banderas! It's so beautiful!
2213,I have never been there. You must be really excited about the trip. How much will you spend for the on going trip?
2213,"about 350, and I wanted to bring my girlfriend, so all in all about 740 with fees. Hopefully they have nice blue or red flowers there!"
2214,"I love ""Creep."" What other music do you enjoy? "
2214,I remember them they were out when I was in high school I think Creep was their big hit then!
2214,It definitely was. it was really my jam back in the day. Soon I have to walk my little dogs. Do you have any pets? 
2214,"I don't but I wish I could my apartment building won't allow pets. I grew up with a Golden Retriever, what kind of dog do you have?"
2214,One is a miniture pincher. The other is a chichauaua. They're adorable. I call them Daryl and Carol. It's so sad your apartment won't let you have one. 
2214,"Yes I'd like one someday when I have a house, I think it would be better if I had a yard they could run around in."
2214,My dogs love to run. What sort of dog would you adopt if you had a yard for them to run around in? 
2214,I'd like another Golden Retriever since they are really good with kids. My daughter really wants one also.
2214,I love Goldens. My GrandDad used to have one. What would you name them? 
2215,which book is your favorite?
2215,It would have to be Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Do you have a favorite?
2215,"I really like Prisoner of Azkaban, I love reading after work"
2215,Same here. The only thing that's bothersome is eye strain. I've worn glasses since childhood.
2215,"That must be awful! The audio books might be for you, I will listen to books as I cook in the evening."
2215,I've looked at those. They can be a bit pricey. What's your favorite thing to cook>
2215,Italian is my favorite but enjoy everything. Cooking is very relaxing to me
2215,"I enjoy cooking as well. I say that now, but I'll have second thoughts after cooking Thanksgiving dinner"
2215,"I find cooking very relaxing, how do you unwind after work?"
2215,"I usually catch up on TV after work, but I read a lot too. Any favorite TV shows?"
2215,I prefer medical dramas but recently I favor catching up on movies. I hope the new Harry Potter books get a movie adaptation!
2215,I agree. I've watched them several times over the years. 
2216,It does. What do you do for a living?
2216,I work with animals.
2216,I drive a cab. I would rather work with animals.
2216,do you allow dogs in your cab ?
2216,I do. I love dogs.
2216,"I also love dogs, especially Canis. The wolf in them makes me like their attitude."
2216,Dogs seem so much smarter than cats. Do you like your job?
2216,i enjoy it but like most jobs it does have its bad days
2216,I live in Georgia. I would love some cool weather right now. Where do you live?
2216,Georgia is pretty hot right? Hot summers and cold winters there?
2216,"Hot summers and mild winters, mostly"
2216,Have you been to the zoo there?
2217,You like to fish? Because I love heavy metal I love fishing with a spear! So metal!
2217,I'm not sure that makes sense? Yes I like fishing. It's relaxing. What do you do to relax?
2217,"Work out, bro! Working out is like, the ultimate relaxation! What about you? Other than fishing."
2217,"I like going on walks. I also like to work out, but it's not so relaxing to me. We have lots of hiking spots here in Tennessee. "
2217,"Ah, I'm jealous. I used to live in North Carolina in the mountains but moved to Dallas for a job! I miss the mountains so much!"
2217,"Yeah they're great here! We take our dog, too. Dallas is great - we visit a lot"
2217,"My dog can barely handle walking down the street without giving up. Dallas is nice, but I haven't lived here long enough."
2217,They have tons of great restaurants. What kind of foods do you like?
2217,"Steak, BBQ, Tacos. Not necessarily in that order. The taco places around here are amazing! Haven't tried the BBQ yet."
2217,What?! Texas is known for barbeque. You should try Pappas
2217,Maybe I will when I get the chance! I've been dying to take my fiancée somewhere nice! What kinds of food do you enjoy?
2217,"Steak, fish tacos, just any ""American"" restaurants with the usual burgers and wings"
2217,"Sounds nice! Well, I've got to go! Nice speaking with you!"
2218,I love dancing to relax. I'm on a competitive dance team. 
2218,That's cool.  Are you a dancer
2218,"Yes, I go to dancing competitions at least once a month, what do you do for hobbies?"
2218,i do dance competitively on a dance team
2218,"wow, nice, how is your team doing?"
2218,We are doing very well. We are doing much better than we have in the past. 
2218,"We're doing pretty well too, what's the farthest you've traveled to compete?"
2218,About 1000 miles. It was international competition.
2218,"Impressive. We went to Hawaii last year, that was a blast."
2218,That sounds fun. Did you have a lot of time to do extra activities.
2218,"Yes, we were able to do quite a bit of sightseeing and went to the beach every day"
2218,Were you able to go out on the water at all?
2219,Coins might hurt! But I would love the extra cash. How do you like the grocery store?
2219,i love working there . people are great .
2219,That's awesome. I imagine you meet all sorts of people at a job like that. How long have you been there?
2219,11 years ago. Which is both good and bad! Lucky I haven't suffered any recession effects.
2219,Super lucky! Glad to hear it. I am planning a trip to Japan soon. Have you traveled out of the country before?
2219,"No, but we are going on a cruise to Cozumel next Spring Break and I think that would be so much fun. Have you ever been?"
2219,I haven't! But it is on the list. I hear it is gorgeous. I hope you have an awesome time. Is this your first cruise?
2220,"that's true, I could kill a fake plant. lol"
2220,Haha. I tend to be pretty bad at maintaining my plants since I travel so much
2220,"I hear you, What kind of traveling do you do?"
2220,Mainly for work. Roughly 300 miles per week
2220,"Alot of time to listen to some music, I personally love rock music to keep me attentive while I travel."
2220,I enjoy rock also. Do you watch movies?
2220,I love watching action movies the most.
2220,I like action movies but my favorite movie of all time is 16 candles.
2220,That's a classic. You can't go wrong with a classic.
2220,"I agree, what's your favorite?"
2220,Well if were going with classics I would have to say my all time favorite is Footloose.
2220,Yeah that is a classic for sure. Kevin Bacon is a great actor.
2220,"It's been good talking to you, I'm Gerald by the way"
2220,Hi Gerald. Cool name. Nice chatting with you.
2221,being a parent is a challenge
2221,"Yes it is, it is the physical, emotional, social, and intellectual development of a child. Unfortunately there are too many bad parents out there"
2221,Sometimes being a good parent isn't easy.  We all make mistakes.
2221,Sometimes parents may not do their work well so parent with good parenting skills may be referred to as a 
2221,referred to as a what?
2221,It
2221,You've lost me here
2221,Where as a parent is a caregiver of the offspring in their own species.
2221,"Not true! There are plenty of ""parents"" out there who take care of pets, animals, etc.  Having a human child is not the only way to be a parent"
2221,"Not only parents raise their children, There are a grandparent, a legal guardian, aunt, uncle or other family member, or a family friend."
2221,Don't forget teachers!
2221,"That's true. Many teacher's have responsibilities that extend beyond formal teaching, such as coaching sports or overseeing clubs"
2222,My dad just got a job at HP.
2222,"That's great. We have lots of big companies like them here, too. What do you do for work?"
2222,I am currently enrolled in college. How about you?
2222,Very cool. I am a teacher. What are you studying?
2222,I am studying engineering. I want to follow in my step-dad's footsteps.
2222,"Wow, engineering, sounds impressive.  I'm sure the income will be awesome."
2222,I hope so. I would like to repay the kindness of my adoptive parents.
2222,That's a great idea. What kind of food do you eat? 
2222,I think mexican is my favorite. I like food on the spicy side. How about you?
2222,I hate spicy. Italian is totally my favorite. I love any type of pasta!
2222,Italian is good. I just find myself putting something hot in most foods. 
2222,That's fair - at least it's easy to throw some red pepper flakes in anything
2223,I really want to learn how to paddle board so I can do it on my days off.
2223,You can start learning by body boarding - by riding on your belly or knee before moving up to stand up
2223,do you know any good places to practice?
2223,I think it depends on where you live. But I'dstart in a place with calmer waters. 
2223,That is smart! when did you start paddle boarding?
2223,A few years ago. I needed more exercise and it's a bit of a thrill. What other exercises do you like? 
2223,I really enjoy swimming! I have always been really interested by other water sports.
2223,"Swimming is really fun and besides it, it is very healthy as it involves all muscles of the body to be engaged in movement"
2223,I've been swimming since I was quite young and it has really benefited by health
2223,I agree!  It is one of the top public recreational activities - in some countries swimming lessons are mandatory!
2223,I really think it should be. Its and important skill to learn when you are young and it provides so many oportunities and benifits
2223,"It does. I've always wanted an inground pool at home, but my yard isn't big enough. "
2224,I have never traveled overseas but would love to sometime. Rome would be nice.
2224,"I would love to visit some of Rome's churches, palaces, fountains and the Catacombs! I think I'd need at least a month to explore the city!"
2224,At least! That would be a fun trip.
2224,It's really busy too! Rome recieves about 710 million tourists a year. I think that's crazy.
2224,"That is crazy, but that means it must be a great place to visit"
2224,True. Maybe they have a down season. Or I can go when it rains so no one explores :P
2224,That's a thought. I wonder what the weather is like there.
2224,"Right now, it's raining and 71 degrees. I missed my chance!"
2224,"Well, I'm sure there will be other chances"
2224,I'm sure there will be. Maybe even for a swim :)
2224,And I do want to go swimming!
2224,You should go before it gets too far into the winter season
2225,"Yeah, I love that movie. I think Keenan and Kel are really funny in it!"
2225,Kenan and Kel stars Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell did you watch that show?
2225,"Yeah, I watched every episode. I loved them ever since the All That days.  Did you watch it? "
2225,I watched all of them too! 90's Nick was my childhood! What other shows did you enjoy as a kid?
2225,Same here. I watched all of those Nick shows. Do you remember Are you Afraid of the Dark? It used to freak me out as a kid. 
2225,I loved it! It would freak me out too but I think that is why I liked it so much. Did you watch Cartoon Network at all?
2225,I only watched a little bit of Cartoon Network. I forget what shows it had though. Maybe I did watch it more and forgot. 
2225,I always loved Dexter's Lab and The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy. I remember watching a lot of Bugs Bunny as a child too
2225,"I never saw those, but I did watch a lot of Bugs Bunny. What I really liked was Tiny Toons."
2225,Oh man! I grew up on that cartoon too! I managed to find the dvds of the show a few years back. They are still hilarious!
2225,I was thinking the same thing. I think even now I would still think they are funny!
2225,It is always worth the watch for the nostalgia. What are your favorite shows now?
2226,That's very creative! I love that idea.
2226,I tried to make a mini cactus pot but it was so awful that it's just an ashtray now lol
2226,Did you try to make it out of clay? I've never had any luck with clay. 
2226,I did actually! Maybe that's why it didn't come out so great.
2226,I like fimo clay. It's not so temperamental. Regular clay is just so hard to work with and it gets everywhere!
2226,"I'll have to try that next time, it was definitely messy."
2226,You can get it at any arts and crafts store. There's a variety of colors too so you can make a sparkly mini cactus vase if you want! Lol!
2226,"not a bad idea! I'm sure if I keep at it, it will come out better"
2226,It takes practice. There's tons of videos on YouTube. I make jewelry out of it. 
2226,thanks ! i will have to check it out !
2226,You're welcome. Glad I could stoke the creative fire!
2226,it is always good to be creative !
2226,Do you want to keep chatting?
2226,"I should be going for now, need to head to yoga soon, always something to do!"
2226,Sounds like fun! Nice chatting with you!
2226,nice talking to you too ! see you later !
2227,ok help me out
2227,"When you are feeling nauseated, it can be helpfully to focus on your breathing and lower your head down between your knees for a few seconds. "
2227,ok i will do
2227,What has you feeling so nervous?
2227,what precaution should i take for my girlfriend
2227,"Ah, yes. That can be nerve wracking. Hopefully you can find a good solution. "
2227,yeah it is I am going to propose her for marriage
2227,That is amazing! Did you get a ring yet?
2227,yes i did
2227,I am sure she will love it! Are you doing it soon?
2227,yeah i think not soon we are in relationship from past 4 years
2227,4 years is a long time! Congratulations. I hope it turns out just like you want it too!
2227,yeah it is she is very special
2228,Did they make the pipes themselves?
2228,How do you feel about smoking pipes?  Are you a smoker?
2228,I'm not. I'm terribly allergic to cats so any kinds of smoke bother me. How about?
2228,Sorry to hear that.  I didn't start smoking until I got married. I needed a release.
2228,My husband is an attorney. What does your spouse do?
2228,Are you talking about my current husband?  This is my fifth husband.
2228,Wow that is impressive! Why did you divorce the others?
2228,They didn't want a wife that smoked pipes.  They only thought I smoked cigarettes.  I didn't let on until later in the marriage.
2228,"That must be challenging to have to hide hobbies from your spouse. I'm sorry, that must have been stressful."
2228,Actually it became a challenge.  How long will it take them to find out.  My third husband was pretty quick.
2228,Have you been married to any attorneys? My husband practices corporate law so he comes home with interesting stories.
2228,I think my second husband wanted to be a divorce attorney.  He worked at a law firm.
2229,I actually just recently decided to go extreme and become vegan
2229,"Interesting, I've tried vegetarian diet, but I'm into gymnastics and need to eat meat. "
2229,"You can get tons of protein as a vegan. They have protein pasta, beans have tons of protein too"
2229,Is it whey protein? Do they get it from beatles? 
2229,I'm not sure what kind of protein - I think whey comes from dairy. Plant protein? 
2229,"I'm not sure either to be honest. I've seen the protein that comes from insects, would you eat it? "
2229,Ew no! Would you?
2229,Well I'm not sure. I'm a fan of the beatles so I might just try some! LOL
2229,Gross. No way for me. What do you do for work?
2229,"I used to be a gymnast coach, now I'm a software developer. "
2229,Cool. I'm studying philosophy at Mass. 
2229,"Interesting, do you study logic? "
2230,"I don't think I could ever be a vegetarian, even worse a vegan."
2230,its pretty hard to be honest. 
2230," To be honest I think it is a very healthy lifestyle, I just don't have enough self control or motivation to go down that road."
2230,the main thing is just to try and eat lots of veggies and slowly over time it becomes easier
2230,"Yes, I think you're right. Your body just gets used to those kinds of foods and doesn't crave others."
2230,yeah after a while things with lots of refined sugars just start to make you feel a little ill
2230,"Yes, I believe it. My mom has cut a lot of sugars out of her diet and feels better and doesn't miss them."
2230,"Yeah its definitely better, but to be honest.Sometimes I do miss a nice steak"
2230,I bet! I think the keto diet in general is a healthy way to live. I am interested in that one.
2230,"I've read about it, but its mainly just cutting carbs and eatting more healthy fats"
2230,"So kind of like a vegetarian, but adding in fats and meats, right? No sugar and no carbs?"
2230,"yeah I believe its a hogh protien and low fat diet, and you throw in a couple of their supplements to make the body go in ketosis"
2230,"Great chat, thank you, have a blessed day!"
2231,"Maybe, you are right. I will have to consider this, thank you. "
2231,"It just takes some practice like acting, I failed an audition but I won't give up"
2231,"Yes, you are right. I like the statement of not giving up even though you failed. What do you do for a living?"
2231,"I'm an engineer for a phone company, what do you do?"
2231,"I am Digital Content creator. I get it from my parents. They are both into creating digital content, and they are both red headed. "
2231,"So you must be redheaded too, I know quite a bit about the genetics of red hair, mine is red too."
2231,Really? What a coincidence. I think we would all get along together. Speaking about genetics . I am into this as well. 
2231,Both of my parents are brunette so I was quite a surprise. I got my love of cooking from my mother though
2231,"Alright. Sounds interesting. Speaking about cooking my wife is vegan chef, and I like to cook at times as well, but I rather her do it. "
2231,I've cooked as long as I can remember. I bet it's a challenge to cook for a vegan.
2231,"Not at all. But you know everybody says that, even I did at some point, but not anymore. Vegan food is super delicious and cheap as well. "
2231,what are some of your favorites?
2231,"Super cheese pasta. You never can go wrong with that. Speaking about it, my wife about to make some right now. "
2232,She told me she was having a baby.
2232,A baby I would have never guessed. Have they been trying for a while?
2232,"I'm not sure. But it's exciting, either way. I think they want to do a gender reveal party. Have you ever done one?"
2232,"No, but I have had a close friend do one that I attended. It was fun."
2232,I've never been 
2232,You should look up some videos online. Are you going to it?
2232,"If they do one, I think I will. I've heard of lots of people doing these, so it seems like a lot of fun."
2232,I wonder if I will get invited. I have not seen my family in years.
2232,Get invited to what? You have a family member doing a gender reveal party? I'm sorry -- you lost me.
2232,Yeah my family has been having gender reveal parties but I have not been invited to any.
2232,Oh. That's a little strange. Sorry to hear that.
2232,I try not to think about it. I more close to my friends than my family.
2232,"That's good, then."
2233,I know! I love using it to buy accessories for my pet chickens.
2233,OHH! I Love chickens ! I have always wanted some. I have a duck! lol- What kind of chickens are they?
2233,They're leghorns! Very white and fluffy. 
2233,Do you like music? I play several instruments. My favorite is the bass.
2233,I love music but don't play myself. I'm from Kansas so I'm a fan of country. Do you play in a band?
2233,I don't play in the band but I do have a very large CD collection.
2233,Have you used your chase credit card to buy those CDs?
2233,I payed mostly cash for them. Do you have a chase credit card?
2233,"Yes, several. They give me a pretty good credit line. Do you mostly use cash for purchases?"
2233,Whenever I can but I like having credit cards for the rewards. Do you have any reward perks?
2233,"Yes, 3% cash back of gas purchases. It's pretty cool since I live on a farm and drive a lot."
2233,I bet that adds up quick if you have to drive to town often. Do you have many farm animals?
2234,I enjoy taking pictures with my phone while hiking
2234,"I plan to bring my camera. A phone takes decent pictures, but if I want to become a photographer I have to use something a bit more professional."
2234,True but all that extra weight can be a problem too
2234,"Yeah, that's true. I want to become a famous photographer that specializes in nature shots."
2234,In that case you have to suffer for your craft. I'm happy with my phone's images and the hikes are more about the exercise for me.
2234,"It is worth it for the amazing shots that I can get. For me, the hikes are about the pictures."
2234,"By the way, about that New Zealand friend. Did you ask why they call hiking ""tramping""?"
2234,I was a bit weirded out hearing it. I just kind of gave him a look and changed the subject.
2234,Odd. I would have asked.
2234,It got me thinking how an innocent word in one country might be offensive in another.
2234,Where else do you go for taking pictures?
2234,There is a lake near by that is beautiful. I don't have to do a lot of walking to get there either.
2235,You'll have to take a trip to the coast! I am currently focusing on learning the guitar. Do you play?
2235,"unfortunately no, I would love to learn though!"
2235,It is proving to be tricky. But I am enjoying it. Besides surfing what else do you like to do in your free time?
2235,Hiking is my favorite! Vermont is gorgeous this time of year
2235,I imagine. I have always wanted to visit. I hike a good bit when I find the time as well. It is so rewarding. Are you working?
2235,"I did some work for an environmental non profit this past week, it was very rewarding. What are you up to?"
2235,I am in school so I'm just working at a deli counter right now. I like it though. You meet lots of different people. 
2235,it's good that you've found a job that can be enjoyable while in school
2235,Thanks! I appreciate it. Are you in school?
2235,"nah, I'm done with school. I much prefer being outdoors anyway lol"
2235,That is nice though! I can't wait to be finished.
2235,what are you going to school for?
2236,Do you have a favorite site?
2236,"i like the bbcgoodfood website, tons of recipes and people leave reviews and suggestions which is great"
2236,Sounds interesting. I'll give it a look. Thank you. Are you a candy lover?
2236,"Yeah I love jelly beans, it's hard to find vegetarian ones but when I do it's amazing. Do you have a favourite?"
2236,Oh yeah. I love yogurt covered raisins.
2236,"yum , who doesn't like candy ? what is your favorite food ?"
2236,My favorite food is Chinese. How about you?
2236,"I'm the same for sure. Getting some delivered today actually, I can't wait!"
2236,Now my mouth is watering. What is your favorite Chinese?
2236,Can't beat tofu with black bean sauce. When they figure out how to make vegetarian prawn crackers I'll be a happy girl!! How about you?
2236,I do agree. Been nice chatting with you. Enjoy your Chinese.
2236,Oh thank you! Have a lovely day!
2237,I stole a bunch of ink pens from work. I'm notorious about that. Lol!
2237,"Ah well, I think we have all done that! It's not too harmful to have taken some pens, they are easily replaced. Don't feel too bad."
2237,I know but they're the really good pens like the type the Romans would go to war over! Lmao!
2237,"You could just say that you ""borrowed them"" and return them tomorrow. Can't go starting another Roman war, LOL"
2237,That's true but I always walk out with at least 20 pens in my pocket and 3 in my hair. I'll sneak them back in. 
2237,"Oh wow, okay you might be taking too many then. I'm surprised the company hasn't said something to you about it!"
2237,"Well, they're supposed to be ""give aways"" for our patients anyways so they don't notice right away. "
2237,Do they ever run out of giveaways to give the patients since they are lacking due to your hair containing 3 pens as you leave each day? LOL
2237,"Lol! No. We have stress balls and notepads, too, and those are too hard to just walk away with. Lol!"
2237,"Lol so you give away notepads with no pens?! This situation is stressing me out, I need one of those stress balls now."
2237,I'm sorry I don't have one of those but you can borrow one of the ink pens!
2237,"Ah but if I use an ink pen like a stressball, I will have some messy clothes and hands! "
2237,Yeah I didn't think about it that way but the stress balls won't fit in my hair. 
2238,I keep mine blonde.
2238,Do you find that you have to color your roots a lot to keep up with a blonde hairstyle?
2238,"oh yes you do,you have to keep regular appointments for touch ups. Thank god I have a trust fund."
2238,A trust fund? You're lucky. I work as a competitive ski racer for my money. 
2238,That sounds like a fun profession. 
2238,It's alot of fun. I have been skiing since I was a little kid. What do you do for a living?
2238,I'm unemployed but lucky enough to have a trust fund. I haven't made up my mind on what I would like to do yet.
2238,"Wow. I wish I didn't have to work. What are some of your hobbies, then? "
2238,Planning parties with my parents & fundraisers. But at my Debuntante ball I lost a very pricey Diamond so I don't think I'll be doing much helping with that anymore.
2238,"Sounds like you have an awesome life! I am a mother, so I like to hang out with my daughter. Do you have any children?"
2238,"No children, But I would love to have a large family one day. To me your life is the one that sounds amazing."
2238,Thank you! I am grateful for my life. It was ice talking with you. Take care !
2239,Oh..ok from which book.Do you have the habit of reading books
2239,Seven Kingdoms mostly but the books go into sooo much more! I try to read often. Do you read alot?
2239,Not much.If i start i have the habit of finishing it leaving all other work
2239,"Yeah, I used to do that too. Do you have any hobbies that you do in your spare time?"
2239,Not any habits in particular depends on my mind set it will vary
2239,I understand. I've had some spare time (vacation) lately so I've been catching up on reading and stuff.
2239,Exactly....Then what else you do apart from reading
2239,Been crafting and watching some crime dramas. 
2240,They could at least wipe his nose! I just wanted to enjoy my dinner after a hard day at work.
2240,I can totally understand. What were you having for dinner?
2240,I had a steak and baked potato. It was great!
2240,That sounds really good! Do you like sauce on your steak?
2240,"No, I don't like sauce unless the steak is overcooked. How about you? Do you like sauce?"
2240,"Yes, I love sauce on my steak. Either ketchup or A1 will do for me."
2240,I prefer A1 if I need a sauce. Are there any good steak houses near you?
2240,"Yes, there's one called the New Frontier Steakhouse. They have a live country band every Friday, which I love."
2240,I would love that! There's one near me called Woody's. They have a piano player. 
2240,That sounds great! Is steak your favorite food?
2240,One of them! I would say bacon is my favorite. What is yours?
2240,"I would have to say pizza. I live by myself and am not much of a cook, so I order delivery a lot."
2240,"I live in a rural area, not much delivery. Nice talking to you!"
2241,I was born in the United States of America where I currently teach.
2241,thats interesting. Does that mean you read a lot being a teacher?
2241,I read a lot teaching material that would benefit my job and raising my 3 year old.
2241,"I read quite a bit, My husband is actually an author so I always seem to have new reading material"
2241,"Are you a critic for him, or do you feel like you have to support the material since you are married?"
2241,"I try to be more supportive then a critic, he has other friends for that."
2241,That sounds great for the relationship. Do you have any kids?
2241,"Less conflict lol, Yes we have twin boys that are just a bit older then your son"
2242,I was listening to van halen at the time and it inspired me to adopt this cat.
2242,What was it about van halen made you want to adopt the cat?
2242,I find their music to be uplifting with a can-do vibe so I took it as a sign. Do you like van halen?
2242,That is very can-do of you! Yes. I love their music. What other music do you like?
2242,I love Prince because I love purple. How about you?
2242,Purple rain is a karaoke classic! At the moment i like the song more than a woman by the beegees 
2242,I like the oldies too. Anything that gets me dancing! Do you likedancing?
2242,I do I like dancing when the songs are groovy and I've had a few drinks. Barbie Girl is my dance anthem.
2242,I am not familiar with Barbie Girl. Is that a pop track?
2242,Its the 90s classic by Aqua its very much pop brings be back to my childhood. Did you like the 90s?
2242,"I loved all the boy bands from the 90s. I""m a big fan of music of all genres as long as they get me dancing."
2242,Thats the most important part about music its got to be good to dance to. What is your favourite dance?
2243,Yes! I love purple! Most of the rooms in my house are decorated in some shade of purple.
2243,I am wearing a purple shirt today. I love purple. Blue is a favorite of mine also.
2243,I like blue also.  I thought about dieing my hair purple just to see how it would look on me.
2243,My daughter's hair is pink. I'm not sure about it! 
2243,"lol,  My daughter said I shouldn't have purple hair with a master's degree."
2243,My daughter loves cats. I have a dog named Alfred. I won't dye his hair purple though.
2243,lol.  You should get Alfred a purple leash. That would be so pretty.
2243,"Hey, that's a great idea! I'm hungry. What did you have for lunch? Or isn't it your lunchtime yet."
2243,I had a salad.  It had a lot of radish. lol  What are you planning to eat?
2243,"I'd like a juicy hamburger, but I will end up eating a turkey sandwich. "
2243,That sounds good.  I have definitely decided to dye my hair purple while I was talking to you.
2243,That's a bold move! My hair is blonde. I'm too chicken to dye it purple. My boss probably wouldn't like it either.
2244,I think being a teacher previously has helped with time management. What keeps you on track during the day?
2244,I'm not very good at time management. I make sure to find time to lift weights everyday though
2244,"Well, that's good. It takes a lot of dedication!"
2244,It sure does. How do you like being a teacher?
2244,I don't teach anymore. My husband and I decided it was best for our family for me to stay home. But I loved it at the time.
2244,That is great that you are able to stay home. I despise work almost as much as sweet potatoes.
2244,"I love sweet potatoes! But I've always been a fly-by-the-seat-of-my-pants kinda girl, myself. I find I do better in nontraditional jobs."
2244,I need to find one of those nontraditional jobs since working for a big corporation is tough.
2244,"There are quite a few legit ones online, as long as you know where to look. What kind of work do you do?"
2244,I work in marketing. It's kinda cut throat sometimes.
2244,"For sure -- there are often places looking for digital/social media marketing, for people wanting to work online. Seems like a tough field."
2244,Are you able to work from home?
2244,I could if I wanted to. Just too busy with family stuff. It's a lot of work managing a family. 
2245,That's very interesting. How long have you been skating?
2245,I've been skating since I was about 24. How about you?
2245,I'm not really much of a skater. I prefer playing rugby.
2245,"Wow, big difference between skating and rugby. Do you play with a club?"
2245,"Yes, we're called the Northern Lights Rugby Club. We practice every Tuesday and Thursday."
2245,I am guessing you get a fantastic workout playing rugby.
2245,"I sure do, and it really makes my mother happy. Skating is great workout too, right?"
2245,"To a certain extent, but it all depends on how long you do it and how fast your skate."
2245,Where do you typically skate and for how long?
2245,I generally skate at the ice rink by the YMCA. Normally 45 minutes or so. How long do you play rugby?
2245,That sounds like fun. Our practices usually go for about an hour. 
2245,Every been injured playing rugby?
2246,That kind of job can be nice when you are super burnt out! My two boys keep me busy enough though. Do you have kids?
2246,"i have one, five years old."
2246,Oh what a great age. You know all about being busy then! 
2246,"oh yes, and it didnt help me getting my major in geology. "
2246,Oh gosh! School and a little one. That is a lot! Congratulations. What made you choose geology?
2246,the earths history just always facinated med. do you have a degree?
2246,That is really cool. I have my Nursing degree. I am a home care nurse actually. I just love helping people. 
2246,my mom was a nurse. it's a rspectable job
2246,"Thanks! Props to your mom. Nursing can be hard, but I think its really rewarding. What kind of music do you like?"
2246,"i prefer rap and hip hop, you?"
2246,"I am more of an alternative or pop kinda person. But I do love the occasional hip hop. Honestly, I'll listen to mostly anything, but not country! Lol"
2246,"oh gosh, i hate country too! i think its because thats all my parents listened to"
2247,I wish it were that easy. My family ignores me. 
2247, i am sorry to hear that. have you told them how you feel?
2247,"Yes. But like I said, they ignore me. But thats enough sad conversation. How are you?"
2247,I am pretty good. just doing housekeeping before work
2247,I'm at work now. A Co worker brought in peanut cookies but I cant eat them. Im allergic
2248,What about speed metal? Or the screamo?
2248,I don't know enough about it to say which one I prefer. 
2248,Sometimes metal is just too much. I prefer bands like Gogol Bordello or Elvenking. Something a little different from the top 40.
2248,I haven't heard of those before. What genre are they?
2248,Gogol is hard to describe. Look up Seekers and Finders.It's an album/song by them. E.K. is spiritual rock. 
2248,I will! I like listening to new music. And I agree-the top 40 aren't part of my daily mix
2248,Then look up The Folk Implosion. It's not folky at all. It's a two guy band. Also Alexander Jean.. BF/GF band that's interesting.
2248,"I'll have to write these all down for after this conversation! My family comes to me for music suggestions, so now I have something to offer"
2248,"Oh lord! I have a ton of them! My playlist is nothing but weird, obscure music and this is the only time of year that I'm normal!!!"
2248,What program do you use to listen to music on?
2248,I used to work in a radio station so I have all the demo songs before people became popular and most of the stuff I just stumble across. Amazon
2248,Sounds like a nice job perk. I'll definitely give those a try
2248,It was. I miss it but when they sold the company...I was low man on the totem pole. 
2248,"It was great talking with you, and I'm glad to get something out of these tasks! :D"
2248,Ditto! If you want to keep chatting we can...I think. 
2248,"Yeah, but I'm at work so I gotta keep my tasks short so I don't get caught :P"
2248,Gotcha! Do you use Facebook messenger?
2249,haha if divorce were that easy
2249,What exactly is holding you back? Why are you staying with her?
2249,"Our kids, she's crazy, remember?"
2249,That's understandable. It's tough when children are involved. Do you still get along with her?
2249,"As best I can, it's harder some days than others, that's for sure"
2249,Well I certainly commend you for doing that. I'm sure it can't be easy. How long have you been together?
2249,Too long lol
2249,Do you think it's possible you may be able to patch things up and make it work?
2249,Not if she sleeps around every time I'm deployed and exposes our kids to who knows what...  Maybe when they're old enough?
2249,"That makes sense. I was offered to play basketball professionally, but I had to turn it down in order to be around for my kids growing up."
2249,What do you do now then?
2249,I'm a mailman. I'd rather be happy with my family than constantly travelling for games and at practices.
2249,"That's for sure, thanks for the convo!"
2249,It was fun. Have a great day!
2250,Yeah that's true.  I guess having two brothers growing up helped mold me for this role.
2250, I hope I will still be helping my kids when they are grown up. My daughter wants to be a lawyer like me
2250,Well she's got a lot of work ahead of her. how old is she?
2250,"She's 20 and still in undergrad, but doing quite well. Do you have any kids?"
2250,"I've got one son who's three, and still wants to be a t-rex when he grows up."
2250,That's adorable. You should show him the land before time. It's such a cute movie.
2250,Yeah he's seen that... a couple times.  Now he wants to be a leaf eater like some of the dinosaurs.
2250,What kind of movies do you like? I love comedies.
2250,I'm usually into scary movies or thinking types.  I guess action but the kind where it gets trippy.
2250,i like that too . I just watched  British horror movie called Ghostwatch. Definitely recommend.
2250,Mmm yeah I'll have to find it.  Is it on netflix or anything?
2250,There's a streaming service called shudder. You can get your first month for free.
2251,what are you up to?
2251,"just looking online for some new glasses, mine recently broke"
2251,that's cool. im looking up the latest game engines
2251,"oh that sounds more exciting, are any catching your eye"
2251,yeah. have you heard of flash player?
2251,"yeah of course, Dont all computers pretty much have that installed"
2251,gotta go with the free resources. especially after some recent hardships.
2251,"oh i hear yeah, I think times are tough for most people right now"
2251,yeah my wife just lost her too
2251,"oh man, So sorry to her that. Hope you're coping with that loss"
2251,what about you?
2251,"nothing that major with me, just picking out new glasses, because my eyes are green and I dont like the way they look"
2252,Where are you working now?
2252,I am working from a coffee shop. I love relaxing over a cup of dark roast and a pastry. It helps me work.
2252,What city are you in presently?
2252,Orlando. It is a busy place.
2252,"Yes it is. I live in Edgewater, Florida about 40 miles from you. Where are you from originally?"
2252,A small town in New England. I haven't been back there in over two years. 
2252,"New England is a beautiful area. I am originally from Madison, Wisconsin."
2252,I've never been to Wisconsin. What do you do for a living?
2252,I am retired military and I now work in a Golf Pro Shop at a local golf course.
2252,That sounds interesting. Do you play golf?
2252,"Yes, it is my passion. How about you, do you play?"
2252,"I don't play, but I like to watch the tournaments on television. "
2253,thats fascinating
2253,"Yes, fancy name right. It's easier to just say that my favorite fruit are strawberries LOL"
2253,Much easier lol.  They're one of my favorites too.  I like them on almost everything.
2253,"I really enjoy the bright red color, juicy texture and sweetness.  When you are picking strawberries, the entire field has a special aroma."
2253,How often do you go to strawberry fields? I would love to go to one but Im alwasy working.
2253,Just once a year. We pick a lot though and give away some to friends and family and freeze a load too.
2253,Do you make jams or preserves out of them?
2253,No... that's too much work L
2253,It is. I work for a restaurant so I like creative food stuff.  Im a manager but Im really enjoy what i do
2253,Nice. So what do you like to do in your free time? Do you have any pets?
2253,I like to cook and try different recipes.  I dont have any pets.  They would probably be huge if i did lol
2253,LOL I have two cats. I love them. And they are huge even though I am not a cook
2254,That's interesting. Do you play tennis?
2254,I love tennis but its been years sine ive played
2254,It can be hard on the knees. Do you play any other sports?
2254,No.  I have three daughters that are involed in everything so I have no time for myself.
2254,I understand... how old are your daughters?
2254,"They are 12, 14, and 16.  They are in volleyball, cheerleading, gymnastics, dance, and drama."
2254,"That's great! I was in dance and drama at that age too. So, what are your hobbies?"
2254,"I like interior design.  I love to remodel, redesign and create things."
2254,Me too! I recently moved and have been adding little upgrades here and there but it's so costly!
2254,Yes it is!! Do you watch HGTV?  I have been watching it with my mother.  She is from Saudi Arabia
2254,I love all of the shows on HGTV! They are great for inspiration. One of my best friends is from Saudi Arabia!
2254,Really!  It would be nice if my mother could hang out with someone else from Saudi Arabia.
2255,Sounds healthy. I've heard beetroots are very rich on beta-carotene
2255,It's surprising the amount of readily available foods we have that most do not consume
2255,I know! I have a young son and I always make sure he gets a cup of greens a day. 
2255,"That's great, does he like pretty much all of his fruits and veggies?"
2255,He hates string beans but loves apples and broccoli. He likes to pretend they're tiny trees and that he's a dinosaur. Do you have any kids?
2255,No i do not. But i wish someday after getting married i will have my own. Do you like kids?
2255,"They're a handful and daycare is expensive, but I wouldn't change my son for anything. He's a gentle boy and loves our dogs."
2255,"in my experience , things like pets and kids cannot be compromised on ."
2255,"Definetely, they're all a lot of work. I own to boxer dogs and I would never be able to manage them and my boy without my husband's help."
2255,your husband is a lucky guy!
2255,Thank you! He's a lamb
2255,"That's wonderful, I love seeing people happy in their marriages :)"
2256,So are other games like match games. Anything to help with memory and dimensions. 
2256,"Yeah pretty much, I think the bottom line is the more you read the better you will get at it"
2256,I agree. I read Shakespeare for fun. I was always ahead of everyone else in my class. 
2256,"Yeah Shakespeare can be so exciting to read, I love reading stories of love"
2256,I enjoy the ghost stories. His love stories were fine and all but he did wonders with his ghosts and witches. 
2256,"Interesting, I prefer the more historic fiction but I can see why that would be interesting"
2256,Did you make it through Gone with the Wind? I tried both the book and the movie. I was not successful. 
2256,I've never tried to read that one no. What is it about?
2256,It's a Civil War drama with a whirlwind romance woven into it. The movie is 4 hours long.
2256,Wow that is quite a long movie then. I'm normally really ontop of films like that I can't believe that I haven't seen it
2256,It was a 1939 film. It's one of my mom's favorite. 
2256,I might have to make some spare time to watch it in that case. Maybe you should try to get through it?
2257,"Next week, I'm so excited I can't sleep, which works out because I usually go to bed really late."
2257,I hope you guys enjoy your visit! Are you guys really close?
2257,"Yea, we're really close. We both love sports and grew up playing soccer together."
2257,I love to play soccer! So you have any plans made for you two?
2257,We're going to see all the concerts we can!
2257,oh wow that sounds awesome ! who are you going to see ?
2257,"Slayer, Young Thug and Celine Dion right now. Going to be a roller coaster!"
2257,That's quite a line up! I don't think I've heard of Young Thug. What are some of their songs?
2257,"He's a hip hop artist, his bigger songs right now are Hot, The London and Bad Bad Bad. "
2258,"lol. Go figure I am scared of snakes, but not bugs. Living in Florida you get used to them."
2258,Yeah their 8 legs and the fangs that they have to inject venom into humans scare the heck out of me ! Like i feel they will kill all humans
2258,"You must be talking about spiders lol. Yeah, I don't like spiders either. I squish them every chance I get."
2258,Yes and spiders are found on every continent but Antartica!  I would move there but it is way too cold
2258,"Yeah I agree. I live in Florida, where it's hot. I love it."
2258,"I have been to Fl a time or too, love it when its not so muggy. "
2258,"Yeah, It definitely can be muggy. We have a lot of storms, too. I love thunderstorms. The sky lights up red, my favorite color"
2258,"I like storms also, I live in El Paso as a child and remember lightening storms with green flashing across sky, green is mine. "
2258,That would be so pretty to watch. I've never been to Texas.
2258,"I loved it there, the dry heat in the desert is the best. "
2258,"Yeah, I'm sure its a lot better without the humidity. "
2258,"Aye it is, now I live in Kentucky "
2259,"I live in Dallas,TX.  I am a Republican also. What do you do for a living"
2259,I work in a bar  in downtown NYC. We get some crazy people in there.
2259,I can only imagine. I went to NYC once and loved it. I am a Physical Therapist. Boring I know
2259,"Nothing wrong with Physio! Really useful. Bar work isn't always what it's hyped up to be, although I enjoy making people smile."
2259,That's cool. Are you married. I am and my wife is a nurse. So she makes all the money in our home.
2259,I am. My wife also works at the bar. It's a family business. Her side.
2259,That's pretty neat! I would love to own my own business. Do you like the family business?
2259,"It's a great place to work, although your work ends up coming home and yelling at you on a bad night!"
2259,I can see that. Do you drink while your working. That would be tempting for me. 
2259,"Occasionally, usually when someone buys me one. Although I try to limit myself to one or two an hour. Do you have a favorite drink?"
2259,"Not really, I am a draft beer kinda guy. It's been nice talking to you!!"
2259,"It's been fun! I like the craft beers myself, along with some good whiskey!"
2259,Whiskey is nice
2260,"So, what exactly was it that poor people did for nourishment?"
2260,They worked for hours for little pay and minimal food
2260,That's horrible. Can you imagine living like that?
2260,"It sounds awful, I would hunt instead"
2260,"I probably would too. Although, I don't have experience with guns. However, sometimes I have sword fights with strangers in the park."
2260,Well it's good that you know how to protect yourself? Would you like to hunt with me?
2260,That sounds like it would be fun. What kind of animals will we hunt?
2260,"pigs, chicken, deer, or people if you want"
2260,We can meet at the park. I'll be easy to find because I just dyed my hair pink and purple.
2260,When do you want to meet?
2260,How does this Sunday sound? We can meet early in the morning
2260,"sounds like a plan, ill bring my guns to hunt with"
2261,I am. I hope she can take care of herself out there all alone without my guidance.
2261,I'm sure she'll be ok. They have plenty of teachers that help out the first year. 
2261,"That's reassuring. She's excited to be in a new creative writing class first period. I'm glad she takes after her mother, haha. "
2261,That sounds fun. I take after my mom also. We are pretty much best friends.
2261,That's awesome. What are your favorite things to do together?
2261,Mainly outdoor activities. She is begging me to go skydiving but I am afraid of heights unfortunately. Ever been skydiving?
2261,"I have not! We like activities on the ground, like getting our hair done together, even though its hard to dye black hair, lol."
2261,As long as you are doing activities together that is all that really matters.
2261,That's very true. I'm glad we can be close so she can trust coming to me if she has any problems. High school is a daunting experience.
2262,I'd like to think they are. I try to read a wide genre of books. I finished the Kite Runner last night.
2262,What's that one about?
2262,It's about two young friends who grew up together in Afghanistan. Very tragic but beautiful. Do you have a favorite book?
2262,I mostly like nonfiction. I am reading Touched with Fire now.
2262,That's really cool? I also love to paint with acrylics. Do you like painting or drawing?
2262,"A also like to read books in French. The book The Little Prince was written in French. Have you heard of it. Yes, I like to sketch."
2262,I loved it as a child. It made me feel like I was on an adventure too. What do you like to sketch?
2262,"I enjoy sketching people, buildings, flowers.  Anything can be inspiration really for freehand drawing."
2262,I like that. I do landscape painting mainly. Do you speak french?
2262,"No, I just taught myself with Rosetta Stone and don't speak it outloud."
2262,That's admirable!
2262,"Haha, thank you!"
2263,Do you have plans to enjoy the weather?
2263,No - I think I'll go a walk and come home to watch the soccer
2263,That sounds like fun! 
2263,How's the weather there?  ANy plans?
2263,"It is very nice, Im planning on visiting my grandparents and practicing my italian with them."
2263,"Ah, I guess that makes you Italian! My grandparents are Irish."
2263,That't really cool! Do you get to visit the often
2263,I wish I could more often but they live in another country so it's a bit hard
2263,That makes sense. Are they in ireland?
2263,"They are, yes.  I've only been once in the last decade but they come here sometimes"
2263,I've never been but ive always wanted to visit Ireland
2263,Maybe one day you'll go!  There are many places I would like to visit that I have not been able to yet
2264,Blue eyes are beautiful!
2264,They are but brown eyes are more intelligent lol
2264,So they say haha I'm not really sure there's any scientific proof though ;)
2264,The only diff is that brown eyes are more healthy...serious.
2264,"Show me proof haha brown eyes are a recessive trait, I know that much"
2264,I have brown eyes but I'm blind as a bat LOL. Who knows. At least we can see!
2264,I do enjoy being able to see lol what's the most interesting thing you've seen in the last week?
2264,How much money I made on Monday LOL! How about you?
2264,"Haaaa!  That's rad :D I saw a homeless man peeing into a jug, was interesting, Idk lolol"
2264,I can't imagine being homeless. I hate being cold! lol
2264,"Same, at least there are local shelters and nice old ladies handing out hand made blankets :)"
2264,I wouldn't know! LOL But I am a nice old lady!
2265,"I will try to do that by eating a lot of pistachio ice cream, its my favorite."
2265,Pistachio ice cream is so delicious. Got to be lactose free milk for me and no real sugar. Don't want to raise my blood sugar level.
2265,"That is true. I watch videos of surgery, its one of my favorite as well. They do a lot of surgery's on people who eat a lot of sugars. "
2265,"That is very interesting. I am currently trying to open my own specialized grocery store. Hoping for a Amazon Fresh type, but smaller scale."
2265,Sounds like a lot of work. Do you have a business plan in place yet? 
2265,Yes I do. I've already got a loan from a local bank and my Uncle is providing all of my connections for the type of groceries I plan to provide.
2265,Very nice. Do you have any idea how many employees you would want to hire? And will you sell pistachio ice cream?
2265, I plan to have at least 8 employees. I'm thinking 6 hour shifts each. It's only a 2000 sqft.  Of course on Pistachio ice cream!
2265,Sounds like you just need to put the plan in place now. How long till the grand opening? 
2265,"Hopefully 3 month. Since I'm a Volunteer fire fighter, I was kind of torn between starting the grocery store and continue fire fighting on a regular basis."
2265,"Well, thank you for your service to the public. 3 months is not that far off. "
2265,"Yes, so much to do with so little time. I've been trying to assign duties to others, but I end up having to finish them all."
2266,I work for a large hospital and am hoping a good review leads me to a hike in pay.
2266,"Oh I see, what kind of hospital is it? General or private?"
2266,It's a private hospital and sorry about the confusion on my first statement. I love the outdoors and got a little ahead of myself.
2266,It's okay I understand. How do you find it working in a private hospital?
2266,I love all the people. I used to work for a private practice and seeing the same couple people every day got a little dull.
2266,Hopefully you will get your hike soon. What do you normally do other than walking to pass the time#?
2266,I really enjoy boating but the rivers have been pretty dry around where I live this year.
2266,It must have been really hot recently then. How hot has it been?
2266,It's cool now but it was scorching a couple weeks ago.
2266,It must be quite nice now its cooled down then. When will you be likely to go hiking?
2266,I try to go whenever I can. The weekends are normally when I can go but the crowds can be bad.
2266,"Yeah I bet they can be, how long do you normally walk for?"
2267,"heh, vocabulary was never my strong suit"
2267,I just call a boat...boat. I don't know the difference. I just don't ride them because I get sea sick.
2267,"it's not so bad, what do you do for fun?"
2267,"I'm a bit of a nerd. I'm trying to write a book. I paint, make jewelry, read, tie-dye stuff. Rather boring actually. "
2267,tie-dye sounds really cool! maybe you can make a blue and orange shirt to match my hair haha
2267,I could. two colors are easy to tie-dye. That would be good in a spiral.
2267,so what is your book gonna be about?
2267,"It's a mix of Tomb Raider, Indiana Jones and Supernatural with some history thrown in for good measure. I'm researching Nazi Germany."
2267,I love the indiana Jones movies! that sounds really interesting 
2267,"I didn't like the newer movies. I'm trying to make it a little creepy, a little dark with some mystery, history and adventure. "
2267,"thats understable, it seems that newer movies care more about cashing in on nostalgia than making a good movie"
2267,"I agree. They felt cheesy, contrived. That made me so sad because I used to watch those with my family for family night. "
2268,I have recently been substituting almond flour in recipes! It's delicious!
2268,"That is very healthy.  Since I am in my seventies now, I know I need to eat healthier."
2268,"Last night, I was listening to Britney Spears, baking this healthy bread, thinking who am I right now? haha"
2268,lol  That's funny.  Is Britney Spears your favorite singer?
2268,"The song came on randomly but for some reason, the lyrics really touched me. What kind of music do you enjoy?"
2268, I like songs from way back when they had real music
2268,Yes... and people actually played instruments!
2268, 
2268,I love progressive rock from the 70s. My favorite band of all time is YES.
2268,I like to sit on my front porch and listen to that old music.  I have a house on the countryside.
2268,"That sounds awesome. It's nice to kick back, relax, and enjoy the countryside. "
2268,Yess!!  I even sit out when its raining.  Its so peaceful.
2269,I'm sorry to hear that. Were you close with your mom?
2269,my mom passed in 1979 and it was me and my dad ever since
2269,I take it you are rather close with your dad. Is that right?
2269,"I am very close with my Dad. (To answer your other question, I was close to my Mom too)"
2269,I see. I'm really passionate about dancing. Do you like to dance?
2269,"Yes, I enjoy dancing, what type do you do? "
2269,I love all kinds. I like salsa and waltzes the most.
2269,"Salsa is awesome! One of the types of music in Cuba, are you hispanic by any chance?"
2269,"I'm half Cuban. My mom is white, and my father is Cuban. What about you?"
2269,"No, I am not Cuban on either side. European-American."
2269,That's interesting. Have you ever done one of those ancestry DNA tests?
2269,"YEs, I have"
2270,that sounds awesome. I love the adrenaline rush when skydiving.
2270,"I bet its quite the rush, I've never had the chance to try "
2270,"you should try it if you ever get the chance, don't think I will be able to again anytime soon"
2270,"Oh thats too bad, whys that?"
2270,"My old Honda needs a lot of work, so I won't have the money anytime soon."
2270,"thats too bad, can you do most of the work yourself. My mom used to be a mechanic before she died"
2270,"I'm sorry to hear about your mother. No, I know nothing about fixing cars."
2270,"it was a long time ago, Yeah thats too bad. Best to shop around for a few quotes"
2270,"Yeah, I plan to. Guess I will spend my free time reading the latest political thrillers until I can get it fixed."
2270,good to keep the mind active since you wont be getting around much
2270,"I agree. Hopefully I can get back to skydiving soon, I have a new place with awesome views that I want to try out."
2270,"talking to you has inspired me to try it, I'm going to try and sign up at my local skydiving club"
2271,This is a great market for all ages!
2271,"Yes, it is! Specifically in skateparks which have been around since the 1970s. A lot fo aggressive skaters go there."
2271,This is where Tony Hawk and a lot of well known skaters go to stay ready for competitions.
2271,I used to play the Tony Hawk videogames. It's how I got interested in skating to begin with.
2271,"Yes, Tony Hawk is a legend both in the competing arena as well as gamer community."
2271,"Definitely, I bought it the second it was released."
2271,My children still play it as well. I expect it to be around for generations to come.
2271,"Yes, It's very classic game."
2271,I agree
2271,I heard they remade it for the current consoles recently
2271,"Yes, a whole game conversion for almost every device. Also they have the soundtrack available for those who love the music."
2271,I had the soundtrack on loop for the first one during my childhood.
2272,Well statistically blackjack is between you against the dealer. Not any other player. So a 50% change of winning every time.
2272,"Wow. Interesting. The game is also called twenty-one, where on has to  compare card game between usually several players and a dealer"
2272,"Yes, that is correct. I happen to be a black jack dealer and have a statistics degree, so I am very familiar with what goes on. "
2273,It is.  She spoils me..
2273,What are some of your favorite dishes?
2273,Chili and cornbread is one.  I also love cherries in the snow. Its an amazing dessert with angel food cake.
2273,"Chili and cornbread are always good. My favorite is BBQ, Texas-style specifically. Do you live in the USA?"
2273,"Those foods are always good but I have to stay in shape from eating all of it.  Yes, I live in Georgia."
2273,"Yes, plenty of exercise needed. Do you have any family at all? I'm divorced with two kids. "
2273,I like to run.  I just bought a great pear of running shoes. Theyre awesome.  Im divorced with three kids.ced with t
2273,Do you do any trail running? I hike a lot and have seen a few runners out on the trails.
2273,Im too clumsy for that lol  Do you like the hiking?
2273,"Yes, it's probably my favorite hobby. We just moved to Colorado so hopefully we'll be hiking a lot more when spring comes around. "
2273,Thats great.  Ergonomics is kind of a hobby of mine too.  I love the keyboards and chairs.
2274,i havent had lunch yet
2274,i am so hungry i always feel like this
2274,haha same. i'm leaving work early today so i just skipped lunch
2274,Me too. But I am gonna have to go eat a snack. I am insecure eating around people though
2274,ah that is rough. my mom is like that too. never a problem for me though
2274,oh i know . i always feel judged and never know what to do .
2274,what kind of snack are you going to have
2274,I think I will just grab some chips. That should hold me over till I leave work. 
2274,chips sound good. but i prefer sweets
2274,"I do too. But I am trying to lose a little weight, Im going on vacation soon. "
2274,that's cool. what kind of vacation?
2274,"Just a cruise to the Bahamas, I can't wait. I love cruises"
2275,Vanilla ice cream is probably my favorite snack if I had to choose.
2275,I love it too! Especially with toppings. Do you drink coffee?
2275,I do drink coffee! I am a pilot so coffee is my go to energy source for long flights.
2276,"Yeah, she does! I like music, I like TV too. What are your favorite shows?"
2276,I love the office. What is yours?
2276,"Office is hilarious! I like to eat, so I like cooking shows.Do you like cooking shows?"
2276,"I have a few times, my mom is really into cooking shows, so I watched them a lot growing up, and still catch a few now and then."
2276,"I actually tried out for a cooking show once! They didn't pick me, unfortunately.. But I wont give up! "
2276,"Oh I see. Well I'm sure you can practice some! Cooking goes back a long way, 2 million years ago! I'm sure they didn't know what they were doing either."
2276,"lol! Yeah, I practice a lot. I'm sure i'll get it one day. So how are you today?"
2276,quite well . thanks for asking . I will be even better after I listen to Britney Spears!
2276,Have you ever been to one of her concerts? I bet they are awesome.
2276,I have 3 times! She is my favorite artist.
2276,Wow! You're lucky. I would love to see her one day. I wonder if she is still doing shows in Las Vegas?
2276,"I think so, but she also spent some time in Los Angeles."
2276,I've never been to LA. I feel like the traffic would be horrendous lol.
2277,Where did the word come from?
2277,"It comes from taximeter ""automatic meter to record the distance and fare"". The more you know ;)"
2277,Wow never knew that but it makes total sense.
2277,my dad use to work for the taxi service so traveling was hard for us
2277,Where did he drive primarily?
2277,Downtown philadelphia. thank goodness he retired.
2278,I read not long ago there is also something called insulin resistance which is the result of eating constantly
2278,People with diabetic should takecare than the normal person about everything they do on their everyday activity
2278,"That's for sure, it's not a good thing to have to deal with"
2278,I have seen many people with diabetic and with good lifestyle had a long life span
2278,"Good lifestyle is harder for some than others, my uncle passed away at 47 due addiction (food)"
2278,"Oh... very sad to hear,was he having diabetic"
2278,Diabetes and obesity.  He ate more food in one day than I do in a week probably :/
2278,Do you listen to music...and what else your habits
2278,"I love music of all kinds, especially from metal and rock though, you?"
2278,I do hear music but some time i wont find time 
2278,There's always time for music though!  It makes almost everything better :D
2278,some time watching movie going out it depends
2279,It was awful. I had to send it back because it was still pink and raw on the inside!
2279,"Well maybe next time you can try to cook them, instead of eating them raw!"
2279,"Well, that was the problem. The chef at the restaurant served me raw chicken. Maybe I should just cook for myself."
2279,i eat chicken every day at my new job but i eat with my fingers .
2279,That's fascinating. What kind of chicken is your favorite?
2279,My favorite chicken is medium-well. I have purple hair.
2279,Purple hair is quite unique. Do you dye it yourself?
2279,Yes I used a tie-dye kit.
2279,I'm surprised that actually works. I've been thinking about dying my dog's hair.
2279,You should give your dog a paintjob like a race car.
2279,That would be really funny but too cruel. I love my dog.
2279,"I guess so. Fashion over anything, though."
2280,Safari Park
2280,Can't say that I've ever been. Is it a fun time?
2280,yes it is
2280,Glad to hear. I might visit some time.
2280,yeah you should
2280,You should try checking out some parks in Georgia. They're very fun to visit alone.
2280,which park
2280,The Appalachian Trail Conservancy is one of the funner ones.
2280,yeah i will visit sounds good
2280,I definitely would recommend it. What else do you do for fun?
2280,what kind of funny things i can do there.
2280,I'm not sure what you mean?
2281,What draws you toward emergency medicine? 
2281,I love helping people and work well under extreme pressure. I would love to move out of the city though.
2281,"Wow, I don't know about high pressure jobs. I wanted to be an actor myself but it was too high pressure. Why move out of the city?"
2281,I love horses and used to ride when I was younger but that's tough to do where I live. I see acting as a high pressure job!
2281,"You love horses.....me, I'm in love with a girl who's unaware of it."
2281,Have you told her? 
2281,No...there are extenuating circumstances...
2281,"Well, that's tough... I have been in love with someone who couldn't reciprocate and there's nothing like that pain. "
2281,Yes it is agonizing
2281,"The buddhists say that, ""life is suffering""... I find myself understanding that more and more as i get older."
2281,Wisdom does come with age!
2281,I hope so! haha
2282,"He is really talented, I hope I can watch them perform some day"
2282,Me too!  I can't wait to see him play! I need to save money first
2282,Do you know when your going to see them?
2282,Not yet. I need to find a new job. Stuck in a Factory for now. Doesn't pay very well.
2282,That's rough. I hope you can find something. I currently work two jobs as a cashier
2282,I may need to do that for a while. I love to travel and go to their show. I could save some money that way. 
2282,That sounds like a good plan!
2282,What songs do you like most from Red Hot Chili Peppers?
2282,currently I really love dark Necessities but it really depends of the day. What is yours?
2282,Californication for sure!!
2282,That is a classic
2282,Yes. I love their music.
2283,I work at an elementary school and when I hear kids call each other fat it reminds me of childhood.
2283,"I was an elementary school kid that got called fat a lot, so I can completely relate to that. =("
2283,Kids can be very cruel at that age. I'm sorry you were bullied. Are you ok now?
2283,"Yeah, I'm one of very few that can at least say I weigh the same as I did my senior year of high school. haha"
2283,Lucky duck! I just moved into a new apartment near work and it has a gym that I have been using.
2283,"That's cool!  I hate working out, I hate sweating.  Also, I'm not saying I wasn't fat my senior year, I just stayed the exact same. lol"
2283,What kind of exercise do you engage in? It's hard to do that without sweating.
2283,"If I do exercise, I'll do anything unconventional.  My favorite thing is hula-hooping. I made my own out of irrigation pipe."
2283,Wow! That is impressive! The kids in my elementary class are always doing that at recess.
2283,"I couldn't do it when I was a kid, so doing it in my late 20's early 30's was super exciting.  "
2283,Any exercise that you find fun is worth doing!
2283,That's very true.  My biggest problem is I don't like hooping in public and I now live in too small of an apartment to do it inside lol
2284,Have you ever played Dungeons and Dragons? I haven't but I have friends who do. 
2284,"I've never played it, but I think it's something I would be interested in though. Do you play?"
2284,"No, but I think it would be fun. Do you play any other games? "
2284,I like simulation games and a few card gameson the Switch. I have a hard time finding time to play though.
2284,"Yeah, I have the same problem. I like games that take a lot of people, but it's hard to find time to get together. "
2284,"It does make it difficult if only one person is making an effort too, though I'm not sure if that's in your case."
2284,Do you have to work a lot? Is that what takes your time? 
2284,"Yeah, my time is split between work, a dog, a kid, and housework. "
2284,"Yeah that definitely takes a lot of time. I love to paint, but I'm so exhausted after work that I dont always have the energy. "
2284,And I'm sure you have to be 'in the zone' too to paint. Not just something you can pick up like a game :P
2284,"Yeah, it's touch to feel inspiration when you feel to tired to even cook dinner!"
2284,That's why we invented TV dinners haha
2285,"That's pretty cool, have you ever tried to get them to sing or howl before?"
2285,"I personally have not, You must have though right?"
2285,"Only when they start whining it's easy to get them to howl, I read that Huskies and Malamutes are some of the most vocal dogs there are."
2285,I actually own a huskie! I can vouch that they are definitely pretty vocal.
2285,"Wow! That's amazing, I'd get one if it wasn't for their habit of eating things up. Hopefully one day though."
2285,Mine doesn't really chew anything up. You just have to keep them well trained.
2285,"I see, and do you watch much Television in your free time?"
2285,"The only television I watch is vegan cooking shows. Most of my time is spent outdoors running, or swimming."
2285,"Dang living an active lifestyle I see, I like a few cooking shows, but mainly I love singing competitions."
2285,"I'm not much of a singer, but I do enjoy listening to others preform!"
2285,It's definitely one of my favorite art forms.
2285,Have you ever thought of pursuing a singing career of your own?
2285,"Maybe, once I've done others things in life, but oh well! Have a good day!"
2286,my favoirte book is one my poppa reads to me called go dog go
2286,"That sounds like a very sweet memory, I haven't come across that title before but I'll be sure to look it up!"
2286,do you like dogs? i have a dog named percy
2286,"Yeah I have two dogs myself, Percy is a very cute name!"
2286,thank you. what do you like to do in your free time?
2286," In my free time I like to take my dogs on a walk next to the coast, it's very close to where i live which makes it convenient"
2286,thats very nice. I like to play with toy trains in my free time
2286,"Yeah I've heard of those, they seem like they're alot of fun if the idea of trains fascinates you"
2286,when i grow up i want to build trains
2286,"My father used to build trains up until 1998, he really enjoyed it"
2286,wow! that's very exciting. what do you do?
2286,"I'm currently working at a retail store in my town, it's not very exciting but it gets food on the table"
2287,We went to fogo de chao - have you heard of it?
2287,"No, I haven't. If the restaurant is not near a great place to surf, I've never been to it. What's the style of food?"
2287,"It is a Brazilian steak house. All you can eat meats. Amazing, but not good for my triathlon training!"
2287,I have been to a similar restaurant called Texas De Brazil. Oh all the meats were delicious. They cut it right your table.
2287,That sounds exactly like it. What a great meal.
2287,"I know what you mean about  triathlon body. To solve that, after eating, wait half hour and do a 25 mile run and a 5 mile swim"
2287,"Oh, do you do them too? I have my 4th coming up in November"
2287,"I don't, but I love to surf. When the waves are out, I'm A Surfin! Working out is fabulous. Since I'm a nurse I see a lot of unhealthy people."
2287,Oh you must live near the ocean?
2287,"Actually the ocean is my back yard. Once I step out my sliding glass back door, I'm practically taking a dip. Weather is perfect hear in the Bahama's"
2287,Oh that sounds amazing
2287,"It really is. If I'm not surfing, I saving a life somewhere. The life of a male nurse. Theres a shortage of male nurses. Hospitals need heavy lifters always."
2288,Some rock band that my kids like. I'm not even sure. Skillet maybe?
2288,"It's not Slayer by any chance, is it?"
2288,No. I think they're called Skillet
2288,That's interesting. I haven't heard of them. What are some of your favorite bands?
2288,"I'm more into older stuff like Guns N Roses, Bon Jovi (the first time they were popular), and Nirvana"
2288,"Yeah, I like older music too. Of course, being from California, I naturally love punk too like Social Distortion."
2288,I'm not familiar with them. Oh! I also like the Offspring! I forgot about them.
2288,"Oh yeah, ""Smash"" is such a good album. Their newer stuff I find to be quite subpar."
2288,Yeah. most bands are like that when they try to stay relevent.
2288,You're right about that. Have you heard the new Green Day?
2288,I haven't. I'm almost scared to listen to it
2288,"You should be! I believe the song is called ""Father of Mine."" I don't even think it sounds like Green Day."
2289,They are.  People are so rude to me when they come into scrubway.
2289,"I think people are just so self absorbed, they can't think of anyone else."
2289,People at my crummy job at scrubway are so selfish.
2289,I would hate working there
2289,Its not always bad.  My sister is the hottest girl that works there.
2289,Your sister sounds pretty awesome
2289,Oh you have no idea.  You wanna hit?
2289,"I have a girlfriend, I don't think she would like that too much!"
2289,"Oh dear, my bad!  How old is your girlfriend?"
2289,She just turned 21. I met her in class.
2289,Oh nice!  My girlfriend is 16.
2289,Cool! We've been dating for about a year. How long have you two been dating?
2290,"I can probably repoty it to my boss, I hope they do something"
2290,You can reach out to them if you have a report to make or if you want to help i would imagine.
2290,They're usually pretty approachable. How's your day been?
2290,"My day was pretty good, it's been quite busy and all with fixing cars."
2290,At least you've had things to do! What kind of cars did you fix?
2290,"I was working on my dad's old Chevrolet, thing's a workhorse but its a fixer upper."
2290,Oh cool! I bet that was really interesting.
2290,"It sure was! so, what do you do in your free time?"
2290,"Listen to music, work out and do some training. What about you?"
2291,Photography 
2291,What was your photo of?
2291,"Is most photography businesses, which i took for my clients"
2291,wow ! that is really neat ! whats your best photo ?
2291,I normally take a group pictures in the event or any ceremonial event
2291,what sort of events do you normally photograph ?
2291,Wedding and Birthday
2291,neat ! how did you get interested in weddings so much ?
2291,Lol...... i love taking pictures at wedding because it look very color and amazing
2291,I love weddings and happy occassions...anywhere I can share laughs and love
2291,Definitely... is fun and lovely in case you have an occasion to do please call  
2291,I will. I love getting dressed up and celebrating
2292,I like mercedes! I drive mine everywhere.
2292,Those are nice cars to. Mine is Brown like my hair. I don't know why I got it that color. Lol
2292,"I have brown hair too! It's not a bad color, its natural for hair."
2292,What do you do for a living. I am a writer. 
2292,I own a loan company with my fiance. We're getting married in six months!
2292,congrats ! what an exciting time ! where are you getting married ?
2292,Bahamas! The views are beautiful there. I can't wait!
2292,"Cool, I am going on a cruise to there next week. I can't wait, I love the Bahamas!!"
2292,Cruises are fun! I haven't been on one since my childhood though.
2292,I've been on so many. They're definitley worthwhile! At least in my opinion!
2292,I might have to plan one for me and my fiance's honeymoon then!
2292,Good idea!
2293,it ended up ok. Lucily i had my dog with me to comfort me which helped me feel better
2293,"I can understand your fear. I am scared of heights, its actually my biggest fear."
2293,what do you do to help you if you have to be in a high place?
2293,I try to close my eyes and think about the end result. But I've had to fly all around.
2293,do you travel a lot for work?
2293,To see family mostly. What about you? How often do you fly?
2293,"i usually don't fly much, just once or twice a year"
2293,"I had to fly last month, seems like I have been cheated on by every girlfriend but one. lol"
2293,oh no i am sorry to hear that. did you recenetly go through a breakup?
2293,"Yeah, it was hard. But over it now. Just trying to move along with life. lol"
2293,"i see. i am not in a relationship, i just have a dog who is my best friend"
2293,I love dogs. What type of dog do you have?
2293,a husky
2294,yes.  both my son owen and i are both allergy to cats
2294,It is difficult to have allergies. I have been doing some reading lately about the science of allergies. I love to read. 
2294,i guess my body is very sensitive. i have allergies in the spring season as well as year round.  but i am allergic to certain scents as well.
2294,"I am the same way. I have to spray my perfume on my clothes, not my skin (or I get a rash). "
2294,well i get a headache from the smell of acetone. but i love getting my nails done every 2 weeks at the salon. nothing is going to stop me
2294,That's great! I just painted my nails blue... nothing like a nice manicure!
2294,thats right.  i am a simple gal. i also get french. or now the 'new baby boomer' french nails :-)
2294,"French is my ""go to"" also. My best friend went to nail school and usually does them for me but she has been so busy lately, I did my own."
2294,I like it to look perfect so i just let the professionals do it for me
2294,I have been coloring my own hair lately but it's not the same quality you get from the salon!
2294,I have been doing my hair at home for more than 5 years. i just do dark brown so looks good.
2294,I will have to try that. I usually go with light brown and it's hard to match.
2295,Doesn't that make you tired? I think the only thing that might get me off my couch is mac and cheese.
2295,"nah, more coffee than alcohol keeps me going"
2295,Wow! Do you have that every morning? 
2295,"Maybe a few times a week, since I love drinking alcohol such as beer, with my friends."
2295,Oh see that's too much work for me. I prefer to stay home on the couch and watch tv. 
2295,"I don't watch much TV, I'd much rather get out and do things. "
2295,That's understandable. I know a lot of people like that. You must be an extrovert! 
2295,"absolutely, always on the go, always something to do.  "
2295,Do you go out to eat a lot? 
2295,"With friends, if it's just me I prefer to cook at home.  hbu?"
2295,I mostly order in. I really like comfort foods like pasta. Basically anything with carbs. What do you cook?
2295,"everything, from pizza to steaks on the grill.  and homemade mac and cheese!  what kinds of pasta do you like?"
2296,me too. what'd ya do about it?
2296,I found some hobbies and eventually got through it
2296,what kind of hobbies helped? for me cooking fresh food helps
2296,"Yes, I cook and also make candles for aroma therapy"
2296,nice. how hard is that? I've never tried that. but it sounds nice
2296,"It is really nice, you can find many videos on youtube to help you learn. It helps to keep your mind focus and its very enjoyable."
2296,I may have to check that out. I find coaching with my cheer squad helpful too. the girls are full of life.
2296,"I love cheer, anything to do with dance really helps and keeps you in a positive space."
2296,that's for sure. I love dance too. do you watch So You Think You Can Dance?
2296,I have watched it in the past not so much now. I find i like to listen to music through out the day and just dance. 
2296,"yeah, me too. I used to take 3 hours just to get out the door when my social anxiety was at it's worst. but now I just go"
2296,"That is awesome, you have to take control and not allow it to have power over you."
2297,"Yeah, sure of course I have a sense of humor!"
2297,I totally understand that! South Park always makes me laugh.
2297,"I am not much of a fan of South Park, I like watching Archer and Bob's Burgers though"
2297,I only watch south park because my friend likes it. I have never seen archer and Bob's. What is it about?
2297,Archer is about an American spy who specializes in espionage like missions.
2297,That sounds interesting! I will have to check it out. What other shows do you like?
2297,"Well, I am huge anime fan so I like watching various anime shows!"
2297,That's cool. I miss the simple times of just a few TV channels.
2298,Well it turns out it just started raining! So that stinks. Luckily my friend James is here with us and he is hilarious
2298,That's good. Is the boat on a lake or the ocean?
2298,It's on a lake. And hopefully this storm will pass and we'll get to go out on the lake and waterski
2298,Nice! That sounds like fun. You must be somewhere where the weather is still warm
2298,Yep. We're in Texas. I go to school in Lubbock but their boat is at Lake Travis which is down by Austin
2298,"Oh yeah, I've been to Austin. It's so awesome"
2298,It's a super cool place. Especially 6th street. Where are you from?
2298,I am from Georgia
2298,Oh no way I used to live there! I was born in Marietta. It's already cold there?
2298,I've been to marietta many times. It just started cooling off within the last couple weeks. It was still in the 90s in the beginning of the month
2298,It's so pretty there I miss it sometimes. That's what I love about the hill country around Austin. Reminds me of North Georgia
2298,"Oh yeah, North Georgia in the fall is quite beautiful"
2299,Do you like music?
2299,Yes I do. What's your favorite?
2299,"I like Jess Greenberg, are you familiar with them?"
2299,I am not familiar with them at all. What style of music is that?
2299,She's an acoustic guitarist...really hot too.
2299,Oh nice. I'll have to have a listen to her. I do like acoustic music.
2299,"Thats awesome! I want to see her play, but I need to get money so I got a job this past week cleaning gutters"
2299,Oh nice. I recently finished my training as a security guard
2299,How did that go? What training was required?
2299,It was pretty good. It's basically a really easy version of the academy for police officers. Just physical training and a psych eval. 
2299,"Sounds challenging, but great job for finishing."
2299,Thanks. Me and my two dogs will be living good now.
2300,"2001 by arthur c. clarke, I've been brushing up on the classics again."
2300,That's a great read. I haven't been reading much because I've been partying a lot.
2300,"Haven't really had a chance to go to any parties much, work has been dominating my free time."
2300,That's unfortunate. What line of work are you in?
2300,I work as a computer tech at a company.
2300,I bet you're very tech-savy. Do you like to go to the beach?
2300,"Sometimes, depends on the weather. How about you?"
2300,I really like the beach. Bodysurfing is my favorite.
2300,"Sounds like fun, i used to go out on a boat to fish in the ocean a while back."
2300,That's cool. Where did you do that?
2300,"Off the coast of florida, good times. you ever fish?"
2300,"I've fished a few times. I never caught one, and I got very impatient."
2301,"That is very, very cool. Do you like to hike or ride bikes?"
2301,"I go on long walks, but not really proper hikes, and I'm not a fan of biking."
2301,"I really like being in the mountains, its probably my favorite place. Whats yours?"
2301,"I like to go thinking in the mountains in a route near home,where a lot people go so it is safer."
2301,Sounds like a good plan. What do you do for a living?
2301,"I do art work! I sometimes paint sets and stuff for shows, but mostly freelance work. What about you?"
2301,That sounds like a really nice life. I'm a Doctor.
2301,That's so cool! What kind of doctor?
2301,I am a heart doctor. What type of art do you paint?
2301,"It varies from job to job. Like I said, I've painted sets before. I also do digital art"
2301,Very cool. Sounds like you have a lot of fun with it.
2301,I do! It reminds me of my childhood sometimes. It's fun
2302,"Yes, it was my first time gambling. Now I am looking for a second job to pay my bills."
2302,"Gambling is a terrible thing. I played the lottery once and lost, haven't played since."
2302,That's good! I have definitely learned my lesson too!
2302,So what kinda jobs are you looking for now?
2302,"Well, I am still in school but I am looking for another part time job. Likely as a restaurant server."
2302,"I used to work a 9 to 5 telemarketing job, I hated it."
2302,"Yes, I would hate that too!"
2302,"By the way, if you ever think about gambling again, talk to someone. Keeping it bottled up is never good."
2302,I agree. I didn't even realize that I had a problem until that experience.
2302,"It's better just to take the money you were thinking about gambling, and throwing it in a savings account."
2302,You are absolutely correct! I only wish I had done that!
2302,"Well as long as you learned your lesson, that's all that matters right?"
2303,"25, you?"
2303,I am 28 and I just moved to Sweden. Where do you live?
2303,I like in Seattle! How is Sweden? 
2303,I always thought Seattle seemed like a cool place. Sweden is nice so far. 
2303,"Seattle is very cool, wet as is the cliche. I'd love to travel more. "
2303,I like the rain so I would probably fit right in. Where would you travel to?
2303,"Europe and Germany, that's where my family is from! "
2303,"You'll get there! My relatives are from Ireland, England, Spain, and Sweden."
2303,That's amazing! How often do you travel? 
2303,"I started traveling abroad a lot in my early 20s, and then took this new job to move here."
2303,That's really cool! What is your new job? 
2303,"I teach Science and English at a local school, and online as well. "
2304,"Yes, I want to be one and not let the profession die out. I am unique in that way. Are you unique?"
2304,yes I am. I didn't finish college but doing a job I love as a pilot.
2304,"That is really special and impressive. I like unique items, too, like my purse. It's got a picture of a skunk on it. You much of a skunk boy?"
2304,They're cute but can be scary.
2304,I agree. That's why I connect with them. Cute but scary. By the way I've got to be off soon! Any last words
2304,I've had a good week so far. Hope you have a good week!
2304,I have also had a good week! I went snowshoeing. 
2304,I wish we had snow. I'm in Hawaii. So we got the ocean.
2304,That sounds beautiful. I love the beach. 
2304,Yes! The beach is lovely. Have you been to Hawaii?
2304,"I have never been there. But I hope to go. I have been to Guam, which also has lovely beaches. "
2304,How long were you in Guam? I actually don't know much about the place.
2304,I was there for a week long holiday. Check out some info about Guam! It's a great destination. See ya later!
2305,Why did they flip out on you?
2305,I do not know. He just did not see things my way.
2305,"For me, I was taking out my recycling and they saw one of my two tattoos and flipped out. "
2305,"Some people don't like tattoos. However, that is not a reason to harass the people who have them."
2305,Thats what I thought. Thank yoU!
2305,How did you respond?
2305,I just shrugged it off and went back inside. The weirdo kept walking and shouting. 
2305,Do you know him or was he stranger?
2305,A total stranger. I couldn't believe it. 
2305,Did you ever find out who he was?
2305,"Nope, never found out. I was just scared of getting attacked."
2305,I'd be scared too!
2306,Do you know if they make any engineer type games for the Switch?
2306,I don't know of any specifically. Have you tried Mario Maker?
2306,I have not. I fix airplanes for a living though so I especially enjoy games where you make or fix things.
2306,"Well, I bet you'd love Mario Maker. You make your own Mario levels and design everything from the terrain to the enemies."
2306,That sounds fun! Is it out on the Switch?
2306,"Yes, Super Mario Maker 2 just came out in June of this year."
2306,I'll have to try it out! What type of games do you play?
2306,"I like the cooking games. I love cake, especially chocolate with a lot of frosting."
2306,Strawberry cake is my favorite. Do you do any baking yourself?
2306,I do occasionally. My dogs keep me very busy.
2306,What kinda dogs do you have?
2306,I have Siberian huskies. They are so energetic!
2307,"Yes, better...improvement over that last hell on earth."
2307,"That's Great, being able to pay your bills with no stress is always a great feeling. you can have a little extra money to do other things you enjoy doing!"
2307,We go camping every month once a month. What do you do?
2307,Oh Awesome Thats seems like great fun! I'm not much of outdoors person but wouldnt mind trying something new like camping. I work in finance department for my job.
2307,That sounds good....I'm suppose to say i like Justin Timberlake but i just cant bring myself to do it...lol
2307,"Lol, He's Great! I Like some of his music,it would be surprising if he popped back up with a great album!"
2307,To each his own i guess :) i'm a classic rock guy myself
2307,"Classic rock is great as well, I Like all Genres of music. What are some of your favorite classic rock songs?"
2307,"Comfortably numb, Stairway to heaven, Spirit of radio, Bohemian Rhapsody etc "
2307,oh thats awesome is that the song released in 1971 by Led Zeppelin?
2307,Yes i think that is when it was
2307,That was a classic they really knew how to compose and play !
2308,"Wow, that is a lot of tribes still here! They must have such a rich culture"
2308,"Yeah, I'm originally from Ohio and can definitely attest to that."
2308,"I have never been to Ohio, I am usually too busy playing soccer to travel."
2308,Oh. Do you play professionally?
2308,"No, I wish I did. Then I could get rich. Sadly the only chance of that is doing well in stocks"
2308,Yeah but the stock market is very volatile. Might not be the best way.
2308,"Very true, it is almost like gambling. With that being said, I have done well in the past and hope to keep that trend going. Have you bought stocks before?"
2308,No. I've done alright with a few mutual funds but nothing that volatile.
2308,Very smart! Mutual funds can go up and down...but generally you will always make money if you wait long enough. I have around 75% of my investments in them.
2308,Yeah that's pretty smart. I'm young so I should probably be more aggressive but I'm pretty patient.
2308,"Well, sometimes when your young you don't want to take that huge risk.... You have to afford a house, family, education etc"
2308,"Of course, it's like why possibly throw away money when you can just take relatively sure bets with mutual funds?"
2309,"Well that's more than I know, like I said I just started learning"
2309,I like to learn to create websites...with the money in advertising it's a promising gig.
2309,"oh yeah website development is a lucrative field, not sure if that's something I'd like to do though"
2309,What do you like?
2309,"Anything related to dragons, books, movies, videos."
2309,What is it that draws you to dragons?
2309,I think they are real.  
2309,Really? Well that's interesting. What makes you believe that?
2309,"if you read some of the old stories and text, it makes a good case for them being real.  "
2309,"Hmmmm, never heard that before....There use to be something similar back in the days of the dinosaur, now i kinda doubt it."
2309,"and if you watch the right tv shows, they could be aliens, hahaha"
2309,"i believe there are, but theyre too far away to get here and the universal speed limit is light speed"
2310,What does it have in common with UFO Conspiracy theorists?
2310,Supposedly that aliens are somehow involved with God and dictating what happens on Earth.
2310,I have seen theories like that on the television show Ancient Aliens
2310,"Yeah, it's totally crazy to me but interesting. I do believe that certain crystals contain mysterious power."
2310,A lot of people must believe that because I see a lot of crystals for sale.
2310,Most place have crystals highly over-priced.
2310,"What kinds of crystals do you think have power, and what kinds of power?"
2310,"Salt crystals, particularly the pink ones, contain a variety of healing powers."
2310,Maybe that's why the Himalayan salt crystal lamps are so popular?
2310,You're right about that. What do you think of crystals?
2310,"I don't really know anything about them, but I am open to alternative therapies."
2310,It's great you have an open mind. I really admire that.
2311,Sweet! I also live in my parents basement because I have issues. 
2311,What kind of problems?
2311,"Not sure exactly, though people close to me often comment that I am a neurotic hypochondriac. I guess I do always think I'm dying of an illness.  "
2311,Have you seen a doctor about these issues?
2311,Yes but it's hard to find a doctor who sees things my way. I am a pious Seventh Day Adventist and I try to find doctors with my beliefs. 
2311,I find that doctors and religion don't always agree. Do you sometimes talk to your pastor about your problem?
2311,"No, maybe I should do that. That's good advice, thanks. What are your interests, religion or otherwise?"
2311,I am hoping my parents will let me adopt a cat for my birthday.
2311,"Wow! I hope you get that cat. I love cats, I have a white one named Duey. I hope your birthday dreams come true. "
2311,My sister has two cats that live at her house. They are so cute!
2311,"Cool! Just make sure the cats do not get rabies, a disease which I believe I have. "
2311,I thought rabies was limited to wild animals and people can't get it?
2311,"Eh, I don't know. Have a blessed day!"
2312,"I see. I don't have any children but I have a parrot, Todd. He's like my child lol. I love him."
2312,I love parrots! I have one called Cheeto because they're my favourite snack.
2312,Oh that's adorable. Do you ever take your parrot anywhere ?
2312,"Sometimes to the park but a lot of places are not parrot friendly, believe it or not!"
2312,I would love to take mine to the beach. I've never been before. I think we would both enjoy the sand and sun and waves
2312,"It would almost be like being a pirate, all you need is sun, sea and a boat!"
2312,"lol, indeed. I live in Florida, about 20 minutes from the beach. No excuse not to go. I think I will this weekend :) "
2312,I need to get some time away from the house anyway so I might head to the beach myself soon!
2312,Do you have any other animals besides Cheeto?
2312,"yes ! I have two cats actually, one for each of my kids!"
2312,"I have a kitten, as well. I found him in my backyard. I named him Micky. He is an all black cat."
2312,You found him in your backyard? Did you look to see if he was a lost cat?
2312,"He was only a couple weeks old. I feed the mom, shes a stray. She had kittens in my backyard"
2313,I like to write as well. What else do you enjoy doing? I like high adrenaline activities like skydiving.
2313,i write poetry but not most of the time. I love skating! it's fun.
2313,Skating is a lot of fun. I'm pretty bad at it though! Why don't you write more poetry?
2313,"i like to write poetry. Maybe someday i can be like Emily Elizabeth Dickinson , the american poet"
2313,I love her writings. I did an 8 minute speech of one of her poems in a high school speech competition. It was a lot of fun.
2313,i was awarded for the best poetry writer in 2018. I was so happy!
2313,That is amazing! Congratulations. That is something to be proud of! Hopefully I'll be able to buy a book of your poetry one day!
2313,thank you! i would love to publish one someday. meantime i will be skating.
2313,Sounds like you are keeping busy! Do you work?
2313,I work at home. what about you?
2313,I am a home care nurse. So I go to people's houses and help with medications and what not.
2313,That's cool. I have worked in a hospital as a nurse before.
2314,Oh yeah? I've read a few of his books. Which one is your favorite?
2314,"The Shining, but I like a lot of his shorts and other novels too.  "
2314,I read the Shining. It was way different than the movie!
2314,"most of his stuff is different on film, that's why there's so many terrible movies made out of his stories"
2314,Yeah. Like Running Man. I read the book -- never actually saw the movie but I heard it was pretty terrible
2314,awwww 80's Arnie movies are a guilty pleasure.  I really liked it.
2314,"Ha! Sorry, didn't mean to offend. As I said, I haven't actually seen it. I loved The Terminator so I'm with you to some degree :)"
2314,"no offense taken, thoughts on the new all female terminator movie?"
2314,I'm withholding judgement for now. I think Linda Hamilton is a badass so I'm in for it
2314,Just hoping it's not another 'Ghostbusters'  hahaha
2314,"Yeah, some things are better left alone :)"
2314,Have you seen IT 2?
2315,yes that's a good one :)
2315,what kinda music you into ? i love metallica !
2315,I like metallica just fine...my overall favorite is pink floyd 
2315,"Nice, I have heard a little of pink, but it was a little before my time. Metallica was just on the radio a lot when i was growing up. "
2315,"Well, give em another chance, theyre kind of what you call...timeless"
2315,"Ya, i probably should. My father really likes them. Lately "
2315,Seem to be being revisited by people who maybe didn't listen so much before...guess because todays music is kind of lame.
2315,"Ya, depends on what you listen to I guess. Most of the mainstream music you hear on the radio is just terrible... no substance to the lyrics"
2315,yeah and made by machines a lot on the music...but youre right no substance.
2315,"Totally. I should look more into pink though, I often read autobiographies before bed so that may be a good way to get some interest in their music"
2315,For creativeness i recommend the albumn Wish you were here.....The Wall 4 years later was good too
2315,Thanks! I'll try and see if I can find a good album download link and give them a shot. Lately I have only listened to hip hop.
2316,It was a car crash...
2316,That's horrible. I'm sorry that happened to you.
2316,The funeral is on next Saturday and I'm not sure that my family can afford the debt that comes along with funeral expenses...
2316,That's rough i've been in that situation before. The debt will be paid off over time.
2316,Yeah it's just always one thing after another. You think you get a hold of life and then it slips away. Tragic.
2316,That's life though all you can do is keep going. 
2316,"Yeah, you are right. I just wanna talk about something else to distract myself. How are you?"
2316,I'm good just living life. How are you doing?
2316,Other than the accident I've been hanging in there. Trying to make ends meet one way or another.
2316,That's good to hear. What are you doing for work?
2316,"I actually recently was accepted to a job program that trains me on some coding stuff! It pays me during training, which is nice!"
2316,That's great to hear i work with computers and stuff.
2316,"Nice! It's a great industry! Anyways, I've got to go. Thanks for chatting with me!"
2317,I don't really play with others. I play with my dolls in the sunshine instead.
2317,I do like that as well
2317,it's a lot more fun than having to deal with other people.
2317,That's true. It's nice to be left alone with your imagination sometimes.
2317,"you definitely don't get into fights with it, at least. people can be really mean sometimes."
2317,Some people can be mean. It's unfortunate. That's usually when I read a book. Do you like to read?
2317,"Oh, yeah! I have a whole library in my e-reader. I read a lot when it rains and I can't go outside."
2317,Really? Wow! I also like to borrow audiobooks from my local library. I often help sort books in the library. What genre do you like to read?
2317,"Mystery, mostly. I like trying to figure out who did the thing before the author tells us. Sometimes I even get it right!"
2317,"I do the same! Remember those ""choose your adventure"" books? Those were great. I really like fantasy novels as well. "
2317,"Ooh, those were my favorite as a kid! Even if some of the ""bad endings"" kinda confused me. "
2317,"They were entertaining, but I feel like they always had the same ending. lol"
2318,I hope I can publish some so you can.
2318,Kind of short stories?
2318,Fiction. Mostly mystery and suspense stories. 
2318,Cool. i always liked Stephen King short stories...most of them anyway
2318,"Yes, his older stuff is really good."
2318,I am the doorway was good....newer one was Everything's eventual
2318,I wonder how he got his first stories published.
2318,Probably found an agent....these days you can print your own but i'd recommend getting an agent or contacting the publishing companies
2318,I should look into both options. I wonder how hard it is to get an agent.
2318,I wrote a story once. It was about global warming in the future...but i wasnt a good writer but i had a good idea
2318,Have you ever had anything published?
2318,"No, i just tried that one time :) ....send a copy to the major publishing companies...if they like it they'll get back to you."
2319,I am not a picky reader either! I just love to read. What do you do for work?
2319,I work in customer service and i also am a speaker.
2319,Awesome! I am a software engineer. I design websites. What kind of speaker are you?
2319,"I am a motivational, inspirational, career  and also i volunteer for youth at risk."
2319,That is really amazing. I really love hearing people volunteer. I also volunteer at a teen clinic in my local area.
2319,That is awesome! i love to volunteer and have always found engineering to be fascinating.
2319,"It really is! It can be frustrating sometimes, but it is very rewarding. Also comes in handy to know a lot about software this day and age. "
2319,"I can imagine it being frustrating but also very rewarding once you get it figured out.  It is very good to be a engineer in this time, very valuable."
2319,Great job security for sure. Same can be said for customer service! There will always be people that need help!
2319,"Yes, very demanding and sometimes very draining. "
2319,"I remember! I worked in customer service for years while I was in school. Customers can be really awesome, but others can be trying. "
2319,"yes, there is good and bad i try to lean more to the good. It is very rewarding having the feeling that you have solved a issue for a customer."
2320,"Shaved it off, I'm studying to be a dentist and I had an incident where someone's hair got caught in their braces."
2320,That doesn't seem like a good time.
2320,"No it wasn't, but we learn from our mistakes"
2320,It's funny to think that Ancient Egyptians were worried about their teeth in 30 BC.
2320,I know! and some people don't even now
2320,I wish more people would take care of their teeth nowadays.
2320,Have you ever had braces?
2320,No my teeth are great. How about you?
2320,I used to have braces but they're good now!
2320,You must be very proud of your new set of teeth.
2320,Very proud! Especially as a trainee dentist!
2320,Are you liking that so far?
2321,Did you see the new Starwars area in Disney?
2321,yes ! was really a great movie . wish they would make more like that .
2321,I have all the old movie on DVD i need to pull them out and watch them again
2321,There have been so many films now.  The 11th one came out in 2009!
2321,I know it's insane but they are good...
2321,I agree. I like older films and shows. Do you like Starsky and Hutch?
2321,i dont know what this is... I'll look into it
2321,you can watch on netflix 
2321,oh ok! ill look into it. is it a movie or show?
2321,It's a movie . my favorite movie ever !
2321,gotcha I for sure will look into it! can't believe i've never heard of it
2321,have you seen the new it movie yet ?
2322,"I've had 5 great danes total my whole life, but 3 now."
2322,"Oh wow, that music be difficult to go on vacation. Do you have a kennel you leave them at?"
2322,It can be frustrating at times but they stay with a friends!
2322,"That's great having friends who are willing to do that. I would try and leave them at my parents, but I am worried that they may be mad"
2322,Yes I'm very fortunate. Where was your last vacation to? Mine was to go to a concert in a different city.
2322,"Hawaii, I went with my in laws and my parents. I always try and keep my parents involved so they are happy. "
2322,"That's smart- especially keeping the in laws happy! I went to see All American Rejects, they're one of my favorites!"
2322,"Wow, I would love to see them in person. They  are very impressive to watch!"
2322,I highly recommend it! I've seen them two times now
2322,I would love to. I hope they come close to me some time so I can check them out. I think the lead singer looks nice
2322,He looks even nicer in person- LOL!
2322,Do you think all of the members are attractive? Who is your favorite?
2323,I don't think I would be into that. There would be too many people. I have social anxiety. And i'm a really quiet person
2323,"I joined Karate a few years back, which helped with my social anxiety. It's tough..."
2323,"That sounds like fun. I tend to just stay home and hang out with my dog, Sunny"
2323,What kind of dog is Sunny? 
2323,Sunny is my best friend! He is a chocolate lab. Do you have a dog?
2323,I had a Chocolate lab growing up! His name was Harley and he was the best. 
2323,"Yeah, ,they tend to be really loyal dogs. And very smart, too !"
2323,"I've been putting off adopting another pet. I recently lost my cat, Pepper. He was 21 and like a child to me."
2323,oh that's sad. our pets are our family. they are like children. 21 years old? wow! Pepper lived a really long life. 
2323,"Animal lovers always understand! He did have a happy, long life. :)"
2323,I hope my dog sunny lives to be 21. He is only 3. 
2323,He's just a teenager! I love the name Sunny too... so cute.
2323,"Thank you, I picked the name out myself :) "
2323,So nice chatting with you. Give Sunny a pat for me! :)
2323,Nice chatting with you as well. Have a nice day :)
2324,I am going to see a movie.
2324,"That sounds like fun, what kind of movie will you see?"
2324,There is a new Star Wars movie that I am going to.
2324,oh wow that sounds awesome ! are you going with friends ?
2324,"No, but I am going with my brother and nephews."
2324,"Cool, siblings can be like really good friends if you get along with them. I'd say me and my sister get along pretty well."
2324,I have a sister but she's never interested in me.
2324,"Oh yeah, I know how that feels. My sister and I don't talk much now that's she's married and living in a different town."
2324,Do you get together for holidays?
2324,Just some holidays . do you live near your family ?
2324,"We are all close, within an hour of each other."
2324,That must be nice. Do you guys get together for all holidays?
2325,"Maybe, but I believe the prognosis is grim. I can't play my favorite game, chess, without my laptop. "
2325,that's sad! i love baseball though.
2325,"Baseball is a respectable interest. I would watch baseball, but I am too busy taking photos of chessboards all day. I love chess. What do you do all day?"
2325,i like the tigers baseball team so i spend most of my time watching them. meantime i try different hairstyles.
2325,"Also cool! My hair is falling out these days. I think it's cause of all the mountain dews I drink. Four per day, baby! Do the Dew"
2325,"oh take care of your hair! i have a natural blonde hair,sadly not brown."
2325,"Oh you wish it were brown, huh?"
2325,yeh! i love the color brown more than blonde. 
2325,"That's interesting! I also like brown since it reminds me of fancy handcrafted chessboards. As you know, I really enjoy chess as a hobby. "
2325,That shows how much u really love playing chess i feel you. maybe we can play chess and baseball someday together
2325,Maybe we can play a combination of the two and we can call it chessball. I'll bring the mountain dew. 
2325,That was really hilarious! i loved the combination ha ha
2326,Do you have a large book collection?
2326,I do have a few really good ones.
2326,"Which book is your favorite, I really enjoyed Harry Potter"
2326,"goblet of fire is my favorite one , how about you ?"
2326,"I liked them all. Are you enjoying good weather, Seeing the sun out really makes me smile"
2326,"I love the sunshine, it's great."
2326,"And then the rain comes on and spoils everything, still, I like to  keep on singing."
2326,Do you sing?
2326,"Not very well, I was thinking of the film Singing in the Rain with Fred Astair"
2326,Was that the movie with lots of concert sequences?
2326,"Not that I remember, it's some time since I last saw it."
2326,"I've never seen it, so I'll take your word for that."
2327,it comes in many forms dont you thihnk ?
2327,"oh yeah, a wage slave is still a slave."
2327,"agreed, i dont remember when was the last time i ejoyed a day off , sometimes it feels like the more i aquire the more i want to aquire"
2327,"It's a treadmill, George Carlin used to do a great bit about needing more space for all his new stuff.  "
2327,i think ive heard it before
2327,"he was great, he called everybody out on their b.s., so few good comedians these days.  "
2327,"i myself enjoy comedy , also rock climbing but i havent had time for neither"
2327,"rock climbing, that's cool.  how did you become interested in that?"
2327,i moved to Tennesee where i became friends with a neighbor who got me intol it
2327,"wow, I do a lil hiking or mountain biking but, nothing involving heights, don't like em.  "
2328,The last movie I saw was Joker. I went with both of my brothers.
2328,I haven't seen that yet but I plan to soon.
2328,"It's very dark, but very good."
2328,"That's good I've been a fan of Batman since I was little. So, my interest level for this movie is high."
2328,I'm not much of a comic book movie fan. But this one was very different.
2328,I normally dislike superhero movies also but I've always liked Batman for some reason.
2328,"I work nights in a lab, so I usually have to see movies during the day. "
2328,Well at least you're getting the matinee prices. I once worked in a warehouse overnight it made me feel like a vampire.
2328,I know the feeling. I feel like I'm the only one up and out at night.
2328,It's definitely a different way of seeing the world.
2328,The hardest part is getting out of the house when it's daylight.
2328,Yeah that's like nighttime when you work like that you should be sleeping.
2329,"The worst, right? Fortunately I am really good at changing tires so I wasn't TOO late to my job."
2329,"Nice, hopefully you were able to call ahead. I had to do the same for my mother and father, but we had no spare!"
2329,"Yes I was, I'm an accountant so luckily everyone was very understanding. How do you change a tire with no spare!"
2329,I had to use one of those temporary fill kits which blocks the hole in the tire. Then re inflate it. It worked until we bought a new one. 
2329,"Oh wow, that's impressive! Have you always been good with cars? I just recently started a new hobby of gardening"
2329,"No, i just help my sister a lot with her car so I have gained some experience. What do you grow?"
2329,That's very nice of you. I grow mostly easy stuff for now in hopes of keeping it alive! 
2329,"Nice, I generally grow only edible food! Save some money and enjoy the experience a the same time. "
2329,"That's a great suggestion! I know they say plants grow better if you sing to them, I wonder how they'll do if I play my electric violin!"
2329,That sounds like an interesting plan! maybe do it to only a few plants and make an experiment out of it. 
2329,I'll definitely try that. What edible plants do you grow?
2329,"rhubarb, raspberries, strawberries and blueberries. I love berries haha "
2329,That sounds delicious!
2330,"That is true, but times change"
2330,"Yes I've heard as much, sadly. Have you ever been involved in any street riots? I can't imagine how stressful that would be."
2330,"I live in Baltimore, so unfortunately, I had to drive through the Freddie Gray Riots."
2330,How was that like?
2330,It was crazy!  Just mobs of people in the streets.  Looting buildings and throwing things
2330,"That sounds intense, I'm glad I've never been involved with anything like that."
2330,You are lucky.  That was actually my second riot.  The first was in 1968 after Dr. King was killed.  Both scary.. 
2330,Definitely.  Did you make any adjustments to prevent or protect yourself after this horrific event?
2330,No.  You just have to keep doing what you do.  You can't let that stuff change your life.
2330,"This is very true, you just gotta try to stay safe!"
2330,"Yeah, I just mind my business and keep my head on a swivel because you never know what people are up to."
2330,Being cautious is always my top priority.
2331,I live in alaska bro
2331,Cool! Just moved to Georgia
2331,"Nice, you like atlanta?"
2331,kind of . i live about 2 hours away so not to bad
2331,One time I visited georgia and the rest stop was just a bathroom in a trailer. Made me laugh
2331,"Thats the island located in Glynn County, Georgia right? I'll have to give it a whirl."
2331,I didn't know georgia even had islands
2331,Yeah !  In 1802 western Georgia was split to the mississippi territory
2331,That's...fascinating 
2331,sure is! and there is a lot of history too begining in 1607....
2331,You're sure interested in Georgia's history huh?
2331,"Yes, I can't wait until winter when it cools down. I love to see the snow"
2332,Going down to the casinos. Trying to make as much spare cash that I can.
2332,"I like the casinos, but I don't go often. I usually end up losing everything I spend on playing."
2333,I don't think I can take a bus from Ireland to the Netherlands.
2333,"That is probably true. Regardless, my love for the capital of the Netherlands is strong. I would love to go there and watch a sunset!"
2333,"You and I, both. I love Ireland since it's where my family hails from, and some still live. Have you ever been?"
2333,"Wow you are Irish! That's cool. I've never been there but hope to go one day! A sunset there would be nice to see, too. Sunsets are great. "
2333,"Right? The weather here is very nice; temperate and consistent, albeit a bit rainy. Where do you live?"
2333,"I live in the Netherlands. My country has good mental healthcare clinics, which is good cause I have an eating problem. "
2333,"Yeah that's good. Mental health services are becoming so much more important. I blame social media and the whole ""living online"" phenomenon. "
2333,"That may be to blame! But I'm not sure if it's influenced my problem, which is going directly back to bed after breakfast. Why do I live like this!?"
2333,"Comfort in food? I love food, too, so I can definitely relate."
2333,Good suggestion. My love of breakfast foods makes me want to snuggle back up under the covers. 
2333,"Nothing quite like coffee and breakfast in bed, either."
2333,Yes. Those little tables made for breakfast in bed? I just love them. I have a collection in my basement. My wife hates it. 
2334,"I would have a hard time with someone like at my job. I work as a snakeskin oil salesman, and the type of people who buy it are very gullible."
2334,"wow, that very interesting to sell snake oil this day and age. How is it working out for you?"
2334,"Not very well. My ""career"", if you can call it that, is at a deadend"
2334,Maybe you should think of a new twist on your business to get younger generation.
2334,"Nah, I'm thinking about quitting and getting a job working at Costco. I love Costco; its my favorite store to shop in"
2334,I can get lost inCostco's especially during the holiday season. Good luck with that!
2334,"Yeah, the pay is good and I heard that have good benefits. People who work them have told him that the company actually cares about its employees."
2334,"That is a great option, maybe you can do both and not totally give up on the oil."
2334,I don't think so. I only got into snakeoil sales because the owner liked the way I talked. Its time to expand my horizons
2334,"I wish you the best of luck with your endeavors, having a sales background will always open doors for you!"
2334,I appreciate it
2334,"Change is always good, i am looking to get married again. "
2335,So do I. I never been kayaking.
2335,"i have when i was younger, it was fun!"
2335,"I don't know how to swim, so I'm afraid of kayaking and it may flip over then what. I'm drowned...hahaha."
2335,that's why you wear a life jacket :)
2335,"Okay, so does the life jacket really save a person from drowning? Hard to believe it will work if I fell in the water. I think I would faint."
2335,"yes, it saved my life when i was a little kid."
2335,Oh really. You didn't have to know how to swim while you were in the water?  Does it keep you afloat and you don't have to swim at all?
2335,"yes, that is exctly what it does."
2335,I've seen movies of people whitewater rafting and fall out of their boat and go floating down the river.
2335,what kind of movies do you like?
2335,"I once watched a movie starring marilyn streep I think the movie was the :River Wild"". "
2335,thats a good movie!
2336,"Really? Mine's pretty bad, but maybe that's just New England. "
2336,"Yep. We get looked down on so much, but I think some schools are gonna rethink their attitudes now."
2336,"I sure hope so. It's a good school, the staff...oh boy. They need attitude adjustments."
2336,i think if they have enough positive role models they will do great
2336,"how can you be a role model for the staff, though? they're already grown up."
2336,"I guess, but they can always teach them"
2336,"some of them don't want to learn, though. that's the hard part."
2336,"true.. but it is in part for their own good, improve would help the students and their status"
2336,yeah. it's too bad they'd never see it that way.
2336,"I believe the school principal and other officials play a huge role in this, choosing reliable staff"
2336,so long as they're reliable themselves. which they're kinda not.
2336,definitely and they need to have the students parents around to support them as well
2337,"Ah that's okay, I'm single too. I can't express myself very normally with people."
2337,"well, that's ok feel free to open up. i am from baltimore have you ever heard of it?"
2337,"Yeah I have actually, I've been there a few times; usually I'll go out and get fried fish for dinner, it's great there. What's your life like?"
2337,nothing much i love cheering people up.wanna know something interesting? i have a pencil thin mustache!
2338,I had cats when I was young 
2338,"I had a couple cats, but mostly, we were a dog family. "
2338,What kind of dogs?
2338,"Mostly labs growing up, but I have a beagle/lab mix now. True to my roots!"
2338,I love labs! I have a beagle/dachshund mix
2338,I've always wanted a doxie! <3
2338,Nice! What kind of cat should I get?
2338,I dont pay attention to those breeds :P they're all attitudey to me
2338,Yeah but I want to get something that would be good for the kids
2338,Alot of cats at the shelters are already paid for by donors. You can take your kids there to see who they get along with
2338,That's a great idea! I will look into it.
2338,I used to visit shelters just to play with them
2339,Italian is very good. I personally love cooking Chinese food.
2339,It's kind of hard to find a lot of the ingredients in asian cuisines here in america but I love eating chinese food haha
2339,Me too. Are you still enrolled in school or do you have a full time job?
2339,"I have a full time job, you?"
2339,I am currently studying software development and it's very interesting.
2339,"Dope, IT is a good field to go into"
2339,Indeed. What is your current job?
2339,I work for a museum and it's pretty boring
2339,How long have you worked there?
2339,3 years
2339,Perhaps you should search for different jobs if possible.
2339,I probably will... I'm just comfortable at my current job
2340,It was something Ive aways enjoyed doing with my family when I was younger we went on ski trips.
2340,That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you have a favorite place to ski?
2340,"Yes, its really fun. its funny that im afraid of heights but im very competitive. no favorite place as of yet."
2340,"Man, I bet your fear of heights makes for some white-knuckled rides on the ski lift! Good for you for overcoming that fear!"
2340," Oh Yeah! Thank you,Do you have any hobbies you enjoy doing?"
2340,"Yeah, I paint and I run and play tennis"
2340,Oh that sound fun! What type of painting you like to do.
2340,Mostly just acrylic painting -- abstract or weird collage things that I build in Illustrator and then transfer to canvas
2340,Oh! That sound's cool ! I've Always wanted to learn how to make create on Illustrator.
2340,I wouldn't call myself an expert by any means. I've mostly just learned how to use it for the things I want to do. It's a cool program. 
2341,first date - you can guess what didn't happen next - lol
2341,No kiss to end the night I take it? I hope you went on other dates after though!
2341,no and no - that was unfortunately the end of that relationship 
2341,"I'm sorry to hear that, I feel for you! Have you gone on dates with others since?"
2341,lol - of course. what's your worst date experience?
2341,Well my dad used to be a car salesman and one time he put those inflatable things outside our house before my date picked me up! Mortifying!
2341,"what ""inflatable things"" would that be?"
2341,"They are inflatable ""air dancers"" that whip back and forth LOL. Kind of funny looking back now"
2341,oh those - yeah - that sounds pretty embarrassing. good you can laugh over it now though
2341,"Yea I guess I'm generally a pretty happy person, what about you?"
2341,oh yeah! I always look on the bright side of life
2341,Always be positive :)
2342,I like rap and country mostly
2342,I am more like a rock and roll type of guy myself.
2342,Where are  you from? I hope to live in Iceland one day
2342,"Ireland, land of castles."
2342,I would love to experience the cold winters
2342,I do not like cold weather.
2342,I love cold weather with strong breeses
2342,I like a nice cool breeze but not cold itself.
2342,Whats the weather like in Ireland?
2342,The temperature is moderate and we get a lot of rain.
2342,"I love the rain, do you like it?"
2342,I don't like rain very much but I respect it.
2343,That should be exciting!
2343,I like baking fresh organic desserts for my family.
2343,I use to cook with my family but we are not as close anymore
2343,what kind of food you enjoyed eating with your family?
2343,Fresh organic we are vegan
2343,I used to be a very strict vegan with no dairy or meat. 
2343,"yes, my parents are strict vegans and everything else. reason why i haven't told them my preference in relationships"
2343,so they want your partner to be vegan too? Is this some tradition from your family you should follow?
2343,"lol, they want my partner to be hetorsexual"
2343,"lol, I understand. Some family want every member to follow after them but how can one be true to themself when they are following after others?"
2343,"very true, thank you"
2343,"so as much as you want to respect them, you should eat what you want, after all it's your stomach...lol"
2343,i agree and i will!
2344,I like older romantic comedies. Pretty Woman was the first R rated movie I saw.
2344,"Cool, Pretty Woman is my favorite movie."
2344,If only I happened upon the right guy in the wrong place. My luck is usually the opposite.
2344,Sorry to hear that. I wonder how people today would react to Pretty Woman if it was just released.
2344,I suspect the ideas wouldn't be well received. What do you think about the themes now versus when you first saw it?
2344,"I agree. I was always more in to the content or moments of movies, never really thought about the themes much."
2344,It's a nice thing about older movies...the writers not worrying as they explore a relationship
2344,"I agree, they were more likely to explore subjects writers would touch today."
2345,What is your favorite food?
2345,mac and cheese ! especially in the shape of dinosaurs .
2345,That's a good choice.
2345,"I am super hungry but its too late to get mac and cheese, i will get some pancakes i like eating breakfast at night!"
2345,What time is it there?
2345,"Not that late, like 10.  I'm usually home by 8 pm.  I just tend to stay up late at night, usually playing video games, doing absolutely nothing productive."
2345,"I can relate, I enjoy playing video games as well."
2345,me too ! you have anything you are passionate about other than games ?
2345,I just enjoy food in general but I also enjoy watching sports.
2345,"Okay cool, I'm not that big into sports."
2345,What are you passionate about?
2345,"well , i would like to become and astronaut !"
2346,i see where you are coming from because i really do enjoy the outdoors
2346,"I do, too! Actually, one of my favorite hobbies is going out and hunting. I hunt deer and use every part of the carcass somehow. "
2346,thats fantastic. i really enjoy fishing. its so peaceful.
2346,"Fishing is another great hobby. It connects you with the outdoors. Speaking of connections, I really wish to be married one day. "
2346,I would like to be married one day as well ... as long as i can fid someone who is into recycling as much as i am lol
2346,"Ah I see you are a recycling buff. Recycling is a chill interest. I also enjoy lobbying against corporations, who pollute the earth. "
2346,look at you making a difference in the world!
2346,I try! If only I had a spouse with which to hunt and lobby. I am not married though. 
2346,aside from hunting and lobbying what else do you do 
2346,I enjoy studying languages. Do you speak any languages besides English?
2346,i only know some sign language that i was teaching one of the special ed students at school
2346,"Wow, cool! I used to be a special ed teaching assistant myself. "
2347,"Wow, I bet that takes a lot of effort!"
2347,I have to train every day thou.
2347,7 days per week? You don't take a rest day?
2347,"Nope, I keep my schedule pretty tight."
2347,That's admirable. I used to be a trainer and worked out 5 days per week. But then I got out of shape :( 
2347,How long have you been working with a trainer?
2347,I used to BE a trainer (personal trainer). A long time ago. I probably should work with one now but I lack the motivation. 
2347,Sorry I misread that. Why did you stop?
2347,"I got a job teaching and just stopped going as often, then stopped altogether. Laziness really."
2347,That's too bad. Do you think you'll ever get back into it?
2347,"I doubt it, but I hope I do. How did you get into Olympic weightlifting?"
2347,"I started as a way to keep in shape, especially since it requires a lot of strength, endurance, and flexibility."
2348,I will be walking my dog back to the spot where he introduced me to the Lady who became my second wife
2348,"that is great ,taking care of dogs is wonderful reguardless of the situation"
2348,"He is sweet little fellow, I call him Bertie. Do you keep any pets?"
2348,"no, i cant afford to have one , i take care of my brother who thinks hes a viking"
2348,"That sounds like hard work, you must be very fond of him"
2348,"i am , but it takes most of my time right now my nails are painted green , no time to fix them"
2348,"Green is a great color for nails, I wouldn't worry, but you should try to get some quiet time for yourself"
2348,"yes , maybe i will try a home work out, thanks for the suggestion"
2348,"That's not my idea of quiet, but I hope you enjoy it. I stick to gentle walks and fine dining, I especially enjoy a juicy medium rare steak."
2348,"i take my stake rare also , it makes the meat extra soft"
2348,"Wow, now I'm really getting hungry. Just a bowl of soup tonight though, I need to watch my weight."
2348,cutting backk on red meat helps you with that 
2349,I've been a fan since the Don Schula years.  who's your favorite team?
2349,My favourite team is the Seattle Seahawks!
2349,"awww, how's their season going.  I listen to sports talk radio all day long in the cab of my truck, but haven't payed much attention to the seahawks."
2349,They are doing quite well this year. Dolphins aren't doing so great this year eh?
2349,"nah, hoping for next year.  hahaha   but i'm happy as long as there's a good game on"
2349,"For sure. I love haloween, do you know who's playing on thursday night football next week?"

2349,"hahaha, don't want any tricks!  I have to work Friday so it'll be an early night.  and half price candy the 1st"
2349,"Oh yeah, next day half off haloween candy is the best! Are you from Miami?"
2349,"nope, I'm in Dallas, just not a cowboys fan"
2349,Surprised the Cowboys aren't your fav team.. or at the very least the Texans. No Texas team pride? 
2350,"I love chili corn dogs, Oh my goodness so amazing"
2350,My pet skunk loves them too!
2350,"Wow, a pet skunk how do you manage that? lol"
2350,I keep my distance and don't make him mad

2352,"Thank you, well i didnt think i did either but it passed over us. I am originally from Massachusetts"
2353,"Yea, I was in a hurry to meet my friends at prom and paid for my gas and rushed out of the store."

2353,That's nice :)  I do that with pictures of my wife.
2353,"And, I did wind up going back and paying for the Coke lol"
2353,How did they react when you came back?
2353,"Well, luckily I explained it quickly before they called the Police. There was a line and I was in a hurry, they thanked me for coming back and being honest."
2353,Good for you.  Being honest is important.
2353,Very true for me.
2353,I try to be a honest person at all times.
2353,"I completely understand. You said you had a wife, any kids?"
2353,"I do, I have one boy and one girl and I love them both very much."
2354,Yep really helps lose weight
2354,I don't diet because that would mean giving up my favorite foods.
2354,Like what?
2354,"I really like meat, particularly steak and chicken."
2354,Keto is the perfect diet for you then
2354,Are people on the diet allowed to keep eating meat?
2354,"Yes, low carb but high protein"
2354,So I can get healthy while eating my meat? I think I might try it!
2354,Definitely!
2354,I also like fruit. Can I keep eating those too?
2354,No Keto is about reducing carbs which are found in fruit
2354,Fruits and veggies do help with overall health though.
2355,You eat what all the time?
2355,Anything Italian. Italian food is my favorite!
2355,Me too. That is why I love Olive Garden. How about you?
2355,Olive Garden is great. I love their breadsticks. I like Macaroni Grill too!

2355,I have and the ones in PHilly are the best philly steak sandwiches. 
2355,That's what I hear. I need to make that happen. Do you like Philadelphia?
2356,"Yeah class does have a way of cutting down on the time one can play, did you have any games you prefer?"
2356,"My game of choice has mostly been Runescape, but haven't played it in a while."
2356,"Ah I used to play that back in the day when it was in its prior versions, i haven't tried the new one though."
2356,"Me and my best friend played all the time back in the day, when I started school it was kind of a way to get away from everything."
2356,I remember mining alot that was probably the thing i spent the most time on and then eventually made my way to mining the rune ore.
2356,"I never got that far with it, you must have played quite a bit! although mining was my least favourite skill"
2356,It was certainly  good way to try and make some money on a fresh character.
2356,What games are you into now?
2356,"Lately i don't play as much but i have picked up Wow classic to play a little bit here and there when i find the time, you?"

2357,"They were swamped, world series and all that. "
2357,So say them all :) well i hope you enjoyed it more for you
2357,"Eventually, I did get a discount because it was so late. But it is a really good place so not a shock they were busy."
2357,Sound like a great place i order from this place local...bear pizza
2357,"Bear pizza? Now is that pizza made by, with, or for bears? Lol"
2357,Its a local place because of all the bears that come in and out around town. Because the slices are so big and good!
2357,"Ah, a rural town? What type of pizza do they serve? New York style?"
2357,"all types, but its oversized and really comfy food not really good for you. Extra cheesy and greasy some veggie options as well."
2357,"Sounds really good, making me want pizza again."
2357,"me too, is it dinner yet!"
2357,"Not yet, but who says we can't have it early? And leftovers for breakfast!"
2357,"thats true, im thinking of watching battle star galactica and eating pizza. "
2358,"A model, that is interesting. I couldn't do that with my two children at home."
2358,i like jazz as well . it is very relaxing . anything else about yourself ?
2358,"I haven't listened to much jazz. About me, I also own 3 dogs. Do you have any pets?"

2358,When did you first start listening to jazz?
2358,I started listening to jazz when I was in college. I love it!
2358,That's cool. Could you recommend any songs to me?
2358,Jazz songs by Hal Lenord are cool. My son loves them too!
2358,Nice. I will have to check out some of his work.
2358,Yes for sure I think you'll love them. When I was young I recall Starfish and Coffee was good too.
2358,I may have just never heard the right stuff. I will listen to some of those jazz groups.
2358,I bet you will be transformed all most instantly.
2359,band is cool. Do you love band as much as I love fashion?
2359,"Probably not, I enjoy hanging out with my friends a lot more."
2359,Ever since I was a little girl I've been obsessed with fashion. What kind of things do you like to do with your friends?
2359,I enjoy partying and getting the high school experience.
2359,simple enough. Seen any good movies lately?
2359,"Not really, how about you?"
2359,I haven't been to the movies in ages. 
2359,Do you enjoy watching movies at home?
2359,"Every weekend! I spend so much time studying for school or working on projects I don't get to go out much. But, I do watch a lot of Netflix. "
2359,What are some of your favorites on Netflix?
2359,"I just finished the series ""living with yourself"" it was pretty funny"
2359,I'll need to check that out!
2360,"I agree, i'm a truck driver so often find myself hours from home or sleeping overnight in motels - it can be lonely at times"
2360,I like to try to combat the loneliness by losing myself in a good book. What about you?
2360,"Yes, very much so - i'm a fan of the simple life and getting away from a computer screen. What are you reading at the moment?"
2360,I'm reading the dystopian Wool series. It's good for contemplating a very different society and I can forget my loneliness for a while.
2360,"It's not a series I am aware of, who is the author?"
2360,Hugh Howey. Each of his titles goes in a direction that I'd never have really considered before. What is your fave genre?
2360,I'm a huge fan of mysteries and old detective stories but I am always after recommendations! How is your day going today?
2360,I'm need to hang some drywall but I'm just not in the mood to fight the mess today. My boyfriend will be proud when I finish the job.
2360,"Haha that sounds satisfying, you can't beat getting a job like that complete! Does your home need a lot of work?"
2360,The last hurricane left a never-ending supply of needed repairs. My boyfriend isn't so handy but he's learning.
2360,"Oh i'm so sorry to hear you were hit by the hurricane, was this very recently?"
2360,It was last year so I am tackling one project at a time until I get everything complete. Do you have any magical drywall tips?
2361,I do like to paint now and again.
2361,Painting is very relaxing especially while listening to rock music..lol
2361,"I don't really listen to music when i am, what kind of painting do you like to do?"
2361,i love all kinds but i am lean more towards abstract. 
2361,I'd say i do the same mostly making use of pouring techniques myself.
2361,"thats is awesome, i find really unique items in the store i work in"
2361,Where is it that you work?
2361,I work in at Michaels
2361,For me painting has been a good stress relief ever since i transitioned to female when i was 17.
2361,Painting is a great way to relieve stress. Good for you on transitioning.
2361,"Thanks, its been difficult to go through but it was long overdue to put into motion."
2361,Congratulations on taking ownership of your life 
2362,Do you like to run in marathons? I do
2362,I do but only if I have someone running them with me.
2362,I just like to listen to my music and go!
2362,What kind of music do you like?
2362,When I am running I like to listen to rock
2362,"That is actually nice, I like rock music."
2362,I like to listen  to country music when I am not running
2362,Carrie Underwood is the best country artist as all her grammys prove.
2362,She is good you are right.
2362,Who is your favorite country artist?
2362,I liked Taylor Swift when she sang country. Now I like Kane Brown
2362,"Nice, it's a shame that Taylor Swift switched genres."
2363,"Yes, they really are. "
2363,"I wish I had a large family, my parents died when I was really young so it's just me and my brother for now "
2363,"Oh, I am sorry to hear that. I spend most of my time with my grandson these days. My husband has passed away. "
2363,"I am truly sorry to hear that, family can be a big help. What hobbies do you have to take your mind away from it all"
2363,"Well, right now I am baking a chocolate cake. It's my grandson's favorite. I also like to knit. How about you?"
2363,"I'm really into eating, I love exploring new foods - food trucks are a big favourite. What do you like to eat?"
2363,I like most foods. I have a sweet tooth. What kind of cuisine is your favorite?
2363,"I'm pretty into Spanish at the moment - tapas, tortilla - you can't beat it. Do you have a favourite cake for your sweet tooth?"
2363,"Yum, that sounds delicious. Like my grandson, I would have to say chocolate cake is my favorite. "
2363,Chocolate cake is such a classic. Have you been knitting him a hat or sweater ready for winter?
2363,I haven't yet but that is a wonderful idea! Would you like to own a food truck one day?

2365,"Well hopefully they understand. things come up, you know."

2365,Ive had that problem before. Kind of awkward.
2365,"Yeah, luckily I was able to leave places like that. Usually they're not well managed places."

2365,That's good. what field are you in?
2365,Investing
2365,Right on. Hope you're making the big bucks. Have a good one!

2366,I do high intensity interval training. I dress like an Olympian for people to see me workout.

2366,I used some different ones after I had a hernia operation and couldn't consume solids. I had enough for my entire lifetime!
2366,Hernia is painful that's not something I want to encounter. 
2366,It wasn't fun but life is better now. Good luck in inspiring others in your awesome workouts. 
2367,"I know, it is my calling though."
2367,Concerns are the practice of keeping a cow pregnant all the time to lactate and slaughter unwanted male calves. It makes me sad.

2368,"Yes, my friends and I still play them on our old gameboys sometimes. "
2368,My favourite game (and colour) were red - who was your favourite pokemon?
2368,I liked Arcanine. How about you?
2368,"You can't beat Charmander, I named my dog after him! What do you do for fun aside from Pokemon?"
2368,"I hang out with my friends a lot, but sometimes I wish I had a significant other. "
2368,"Just get a dog, they're better and more reliable than any partner! Jokes aside, have you tried Tinder?"
2368,"Ha! That might be true! I have tried Tinder, but I find most people on there aren't looking for anything serious. Are you in a relationship?"
2368,"It will work out, these things tend to happen when you least expect it! Honestly i'm too busy with work at the moment to really get out there and mix"
2368,"I suppose that is true, thanks for the vote of confidence! What do you do for work?"
2368,"I'm a truck driver, so a lot of long miles in the cab. How about you?"
2368,"Oh, that's a cool job. Lot's of travel I suppose! I work at a restaurant. "
2368,"Oh nice, what sort of food do you serve?"
2369,"I understand that. Sometimes when I work long hours, which I hate, my head keeps dropping and the glasses fall off"
2369,I work short shifts at the library myself. Where do you work?
2369,I work at a Toyota Dealership because I like Toyota cars. It's a lot of fun

2371,I wish they would just let me work out barefoot.
2371,I would be afraid to work out barefoot! Might drop the weights!
2372,"I hear you! Here in Pittsburgh, where I live, people still think its a ""pound"" unfortunately"
2372,"I will agree with you there. We use whatever words we want. However, pound isn't one of them"
2372,"Yea, none of the people I volunteer with it call it a pound. For some reason, it has a negative connotation! Do you volunteer anywhere?"
2372,"Yes, volunteering is a part of who I am. I feel contented rendering my skills and services as an act of charity where and when I could."
2372,That's so great to hear. There are a lot of volunteer opportunities here in Pittsburgh. Where do you live?
2372,I currently live in New York on a temporary basis.
2372,Are you in the city?
2372,Oh definitely! City live can be but stressful a larger part of the time. Countrysides on the other hand are calm. How about you?
2372,I'm in Pittsburgh so a big city for sure but nothing like NYC!
2372,"Gotcha! Yeah the population of the city itself is 3,500,000. So I bet it's nice to be in a less populated area. How's  work and family time managed?"
2372,"Wow yea that's a lot! Work and family time is being managed well, thanks for asking."
2372,You too! Thanks!

2373,"Oh that's terrible, I'm so sorry. You must feel bad."
2373,I feel terrible about the whole ordeal
2373,I can imagine. Take your time with it. I've been feeling terrible too lately for a much less severe reason. Just have to pick yourself up. 
2373,I have to set the funeral up
2373,I would think their family should do that
2373,I will help pay for it
2373,"I would donate, but I'm tight on cash right now. I've tried starting my own comics and have presented them to publishers. Been getting rejected"
2373,I have to go and grieve. Good luck on your business
2373,"I'm trying hard, but the rejections make me want to give up. What did your friend do for a living?"
2373,Was a baker but I have to go now.
2373,"Fine, bye. Have fun going and baking."

2374,"Oh man, that stinks. And it can come from pretty much anywhere: the muscles, nerves, bones, organs, etc. It's so hard to pin down the cause."
2374,yes it is it can also come bending the wrong way or not right in bed.
2374,Have you ever spoken to a doctor about this? It could help
2374,yes i have they said weight after i loss weight they sleep pillow between your leg and bend  your leg little
2374,I do not think sleeping with a pillow between your legs will help with weightloss. Do you have any hobbies? Pottery is what I enjoy making.
2374,you have to sleep on your side it work for your back not weight. yes singing
2374,singing? Do you make appearances anywhere? I'd love to hear it sometime.

2375,Hopefully a scientist but there's so many avenues that I could take 
2375,It's great to have options and it sounds like you'll have many of those available. That's awesome!
2375,Your travels are way more exciting than school by far.

2375,A junior. Two and a half years down. Five and a half more to go. 
2375,One third of the way through! That's exciting.

2376,What kind of shows you like?
2376,"I like to watch escape to the country, I would love more outdoor space to garden in."
2376,That sounds like a good plan. How big is your garden?
2376,I only have a small balcony right now. 
2376,"if you have a patio , you can use it"
2376,I use it for growing herbs and flowers but ideally I would like more space. Do you have a garden?

2378,"Yes, being a grandparent is the happiest part of my life."
2378,I bet. I've heard it's nice because you don't have to do much of the disciplining and you just get to have fun. 
2378,"That's right and I have no guilt feelings about their discipline, too."
2378,Do you ever disagree with how they are being raised? 
2378,"No, because I respect my children's right to rear them as they see fit."
2378,I love your outlook on that. My mother-in-law can be judgmental about the kids.
2379,That's great to here.
2379,"Yes, I don't think he would be alive without modern medicine."
2379,There have been such great advancements in medicine.

2379,Did you injure it somehow?

2379,"Oooooh, gotta be careful of those garden hoses. I cut my hand with my garden sheers last year. I had to get 5 stitches."
2379,That sounds terrible. Hope it wasn't too painful
2379,"I'm a big baby, so yes, it was painful!"
2379,Hope it didn't cost too much for the hospital

2383,Wow. That's quite a pedigree. I bet that was very exciting to watch.
2383,"It was exciting to watch with the hype, but ended up with him losing"
2383,Aww...that's too bad. Especially for someone who's really competitive.
2383,He was fighting someone who has boxed his whole life .. so the outcome wasn't too suprising
2383,Right...it was a big honor just to be in the ring with Floyd Mayweather!
2383,"He did put up a good fight in the first few rounds, but started to fatigue as the fight went on"
2383,Boxing looks really difficult. Do you know who we're supposed to sign off here?

2385,Cheese goes great with everything! My parents nicknamed me cheesey Arnold growing up.
2385,That's a great nickname to have. You could definitely be the potato Terminator! hahaha
2385,That is funny! Do you have a nickname?
2385,Only some variations of my first name. Initially my friends struggled to pronounce my name so we used nicknames and it just stuck with us.
2385,That makes sense. What tv shows do you like? I love it all!

2388,"Well, I have six grandchildren and three children."
2388,That's amazing. Do you ever take vacations together?
2388,Not yet because we mostly hang out in our homes where there is plenty to keep us occupied.
2388,I'm just wondering because we are considering visiting somewhere warm this winter. I love the sunshine. 
2388,My wife and I visited Santa Rosa island in florida several times and enjoyed it a lot.
2388,Do they have a fun nightlife there?

2390,"No, unfortunately. I work in marketing"
2390,Does your degree come in handy there?
2390,"A little. I do business to business marketing, so it's nice to be familiar with the field. Do you work in IT or something related to your degree?"
2390,Yes I do network administration.
2390,Awesome! It's nice knowing your education (studying AND cost) pays off in the end.
2391,I think Madonna has done a good job reinventing herself and making herself relevant and fresh.

2404,"Nah, I've loved them from the start. It's nostalgic!"
2404,Definitely! They just had some glitches to work out.  
2404,"True, but all games back then had their issues. Still an incredible game! What's your favourite Halo game?"
2404,Fallout 3 has always been my favorite. What about you?
2404,Halo reach was incredible. What else do you enjoy doing?
2404,I also enjoy hiking! I spend a lot of time in the bluffs on the weekends.

2405,Candy and chocolate
2405,"Same, are you in school, I attend part time."
2405,"No, I finished quite a while back. It was fun."
2405,"Yeah it's a great time, I work a bit on the side as well."

2405,"Yeah it's great, I work at Nordstrom it's a lot of fun!"
2405,"Wow, that's a nice store with great products."
2406,Because I'm too country for water. I listen to country music and drink  my country syrup like a real man.
2406,gotcha
2406,How are you on this fine day? Right now I'm cooking. People say I'm fairly decent at it.

2407,lol yeah i love burgers too much
2407,"i do to and burgers are my weakness, those new impossible burgers have helped some. They're just not the same though."
2407,How do they taste? I haven't tried one yet?
2407,"They have the juicy taste of a real burger, but it's still not as good as the real thing."
2407,i didn't think so LOL Nothing beats real beef
2407,You're right about that. I couldn't be a full time vegetarian bc I like to feed my cravings every once in awhile.
2407,yeah me too.  I love lamb too
2407,I have only tried lamb a time or two and wasn't a big fan of it.
2407,it depends on how it is prepared
2407,I think I had it at a chain Mediterranean place. So it probably wasn't the best. It was a little dry for me. 
2408,I have heard Austin is a great music town.
2408,It is! I got to see a few new bands. I posted the photos online. Did you see them?
2408,No I haven't seen them.  What is your favorite music genre?
2408,I like everything. After visiting Austin I think I like music even more than before. What about you?
2408,I too like all types of music. Recently got to here a string quartet on a cruise ship that played everything from Mozart to Queen.
2408,Oh wow! That sounds like an awesome experience. I'd love to hear more about it sometime.
2408,Were you in Austin for business or personal travel?
2408,"No, I just travelling to see the world starting close to home."
2408,That sounds awesome.  I love to travel also.  Do you travel internationally also?
2408,"I have only completed international travel once, but I hope to do a lot more of it in the future. Do you?"
2408,I have done some international travel - mostly for business but a few days each trip to site see.
2408,"How fun! Hey, I gotta run but let's get together next week so you can tell me more about it."
2409,"I know, that's my worry."
2409,My parents were divorced so I can definitely relate to how kids feel that go through thats. 
2409,"Yeah, that's why I got into reading."
2409,Reading is something I do also. I also got involved with the local theater. It's given me an escape from the stresses of life. 
2409,"Yes, I really enjoy getting lost in the fantasy"
2409,I gives your mind a break from the worries that plaque it I guess. But it helps
2409,the other thing that calms me is chicken nuggets
2409,"I just laughed out loud. If I had a dollar for every nugget, I would be on the front page of Forbes. "
2409,"wow, you really love chicken nuggets too"
2409,You could say that. 
2409,If only I could combine my love of reading with chicke nuggets
2409,Nuggets are good for any occasion especially reading
2410,My mother is from Ufa.  
2410,Did she move to the USA?
2410,Yes.  She came here when she was in her teens.  She actually taught me to cook some authentic Russian food.
2410,Did you speak any Russian growing up?
2410,"No.  Well, very little.  Mainly the curse words.  Hahaha.  Mom only spoke Russian when she got very angry."
2410,That's funny.  Russian seems like a difficult language to learn.
2410,"Yes.  I tried, but found Spanish much easier.  Imagine learning Chinese or Japanese.  They seem very hard."
2410,I think those are probably the hardest languages to learn.  Can you speak Spanish fluently now?
2410,"Not anymore.  I was pretty fluent at one time, back in college, but never was really able to continue using it conversationally."
2410,I mistakenly took Latin.  It didn't prove to be as useful as I thought.
2410,Were you training to be a doctor?  Or lawyer?
2410,I thought about med school but decided to go into philosophy instead.
2410,I studied sociology and psychology.
2411,"I am fairly athletic, but playing basketball would distract me from my studies."
2411,Sometimes you need a short distraction to keep you doing your best
2411,I have a hard enough time focusing. I wish I could be even more serious about school
2411,School is very important.   Do you not like your classes??
2411,I work a part-time job to cover my expenses.
2411,Part-time jobs are great.   Hope it helps with the money end and doesn't tire you out too much.
2411,Yeah it can be exhausting.
2411,Maybe that is why you are having trouble focusing a class work.   Sounds like you might need a different job.
2411,"I would love to, but I have to eat lol"
2411,"Yes, I know, but you need to be able to do your classwork or being in school is useless."
2411,I manage to get by. Fewer classes would probably help.
2411,Then that might be the answer.   Drop at least one class for now
2412,Why do you hate beets? I think they're pretty tasty
2412,"The texture feels slimy to me. I only like them pickled with eggs. Even then, I don't eat the beets."
2412,Gotcha. Gotcha. Some of the rabbits that I've rescued enjoy eating beets.
2412,They can have mine :) Rescuing rabbits is an interesting idea. How/Where do you rescue them from
2412,lol I'm sure they would gladly accept them. I usually rescue animals from overcrowded shelters because I believe all animals have a right to enjoy a wonderful life.
2412,I think that is great! I live in too small a place to do that.
2412,I think so too. My local church has inspired me to take action. Both my parents are in the church choir and introduced me to the other members. 
2412,Are you active in your church?
2412,"I am, but if you ask me about my participation in the church choir I will just look the other way lol. "
2412,"Same! My dad alwasy said we're told to make a joyful noise. Doesnt have to be angelic, thank goodness!"
2412,Preach. My voice is the complete opposite of angelic lol
2412,"It inspired you to save animals, so it all works out. Nice talking to you!"
2413,"Thanks, I did! And, I didn't even throw up after which is great bc of my horrible morning sickness,"
2413,"Oh wow, what is causing the morning sickness?"
2413,I am pregnant with twins! Do you have children?
2413,Congrats! That is exciting! Do you know the gender? I do not have children but I love seeing all the outfits for them- I want to be a fashion designer
2413,Girls! That's ok. I love fashion too! Especially cute baby clothes. Are you going to take design classes?
2413,Oh I bet the girls will love Coco Chanel! They're one of my favorite designers. I hope to go to school soon. Do you have names picked out?
2413,They would look cute in Coco! No names picked yet. I am excited for your future career. Good luck !
2413,Thank you so much! Good luck with your girls. You should get them some Alexander McQueen
2413,"Aw! Thanks! Who do you want to design for, men, women, or children?"
2414,"I really love scallions, I grow them in my garden."
2414,I heard somewhere that they've been grown for a least a good 5000 years.
2414,"Thats amazing.  I'm not surprised, they're my favorite food!"
2414,They were grown for thousands of years over in Asia and Europe. That's such a long time.
2414,Do you ever grow your own food?
2414,"yes, i love to grow my own food."
2414,What are your favorite things to grow?  I like peppers too.
2414,"peppers are good, so are tomatoes"
2414,"Yes, the store bought tomatoes don't taste nearly as good as homegrown"
2414," i know, they're so watery sometimes its gross"
2414,They're quite bland.  A good tomato can really make a sandwich.
2414,i like to make my own kind of tomato salad too
2415,Where was the party? When i was in community college we used to have them for every game we went
2415,We held it at a bonfire on the grasslands. It was fun. What do u do for fun?
2415,I love to write articles especially about nature.
2415,Well thats very interesting. Nature is beautiful and unpredictable. I have 3 teenagers so my day is consumed. How old are you?
2415,"I am 40, still dont have kids so get to spend time on writing. I got my degree in communications "
2415,Thats awesome. What kind of nature stuff do you right about
2415,"Mostly about birds, I work with NatGeo as web content manager. So its kind of business and pleasure at same time."
2415,There's a place called Chennai. It's a city in India that has many cool birds like flamingos. Do you know of this place?
2415,"Yes, i have heard about it. One of my office worker did a documentary on them. "
2415,oh awesome. So im 38. Are you female or male? im female.
2415,"I am a male, am an orphan who grew up in a foster home in Canada. What about you?"
2415,i grew up in Texas. Its so hot here. My family was bad so its me now.
2416,I love to sing at karaoke bars.  Do you?
2416,I am terrible but it is so much fun. I really like it better though when I'm watching.
2416,It gets a lot easier after a few drinks with friends.
2416,Everything is a bit easier with a few drinks. LOL....
2416,What do you do for a living?
2416,I'm mostly doing odd jobs right now. Currently I am housesitting for some friends. They needed a sitter for their fur babies.
2416,"I love animals, what kind are they?"
2416,They have three American Bullies. They are show dogs so they only trust them to be with someone they know.
2416,They sound precious.  I have a pit bull myself.
2416,They can be a handfull. How old is your baby?
2416,He's getting up there.  He will be 10 years old this year.
2416,I had a Belgian Sheepdog. She lived to be 20. 
2417,Who is your favorite racer?
2417,My favorite driver is Kevin Harvick. I watched him win the 2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. That was such a great race.
2417,That's cool.  Do you own any memorabilia? 
2417,no I wish
2417,I have a few Dale Earnheardt commemorative plates.
2417,he was a great driver
2417,Do you like Richard or Kyle Petty more?
2417,i'm not a fan of either of them really
2417,Have you ever raced cars yourself?
2417,"yeah, my dads a mechanic"
2417,Wow that's cool.  Where did you race?  On a track or street?
2417,both really. anywhere we could get away with it
2418,"well, i'm a pretty lame person so..."
2418,Do you get anxious easily?
2418,"yeah, all the time. especially when i'm trying to find parking hen going to a new place."
2418,"I do too sometimes, especially around large crowds."
2418,"yeah, but it's totally worth it to get to some food trucks, I love those things"
2418,Some food trucks have the most tasty foods!
2418,"yes, even if it is gross"
2418,"I love the ethnic foods, but they can be hit or miss."
2418,"well, if you're not into spices, it can be"
2418,I love spices.  The hotter the better!
2418,i feel that way too. i love to feel my eyeballs sweat
2418,Thats when you know the food is slapping.

2420,No I am not more of the outdoors type.  i spent most of my time in the lab.
2420,Are you a mad scientist? Just kidding....What do you do for real in the lab?
2420,I have actually found a cure for the common cold.  I will be rich some day.
2420,Don't forget to spread the wealth not the germs.
2420,"Exactly.  I owe a lot to germs though, without them, I would have never made this breakthrough."
2420,Sounds amazing. I'm actually thinking about moving to New Mexico.
2420,"That seems like a nice place to live, hot though."

2421,Hahaha.  That's funny.  What sort of stuff do you read?  What does your cat like?
2421,anything really

2424,"Yes, I used to travel to Dallas a lot.  Where are you from?"

2424,I'll take the cold over heat any day!
2424,Me too but not the ice.
2424,That's not my favorite either but the local kids seem to love it
2424,I loved it too when I was a kid I lived in Maryland.

2426,"tupac, biggie, really any of that classic 90s stuff"
2426,"Oh yeah.  I like that way more than the modern ""trap"" stuff.  I can't understand anything they're saying."
2426,"yeah, very mubble core for sure. why are they like that"
2426,No idea.  It's what the kids like I guess.  I really like Run DMC and Beastie Boys.  
2426,so you prefer the East coast stye then?
2426,"Yeah.  I guess.  Snoop's cool too, but when I put on Snoop I just want to smoke and not do any homework."
2426,how about trying to smoke and do your homework
2426,That doesn't ever really seem to work.  
2426,"well, if you tried harder, maybe it would. or change up your weed"
2426,"Hahahaha.  True.  I still smoke that ""analog"" weed.  Haven't gone to the pens and stuff yet.  Haven't done ""digital"""

2427,"yeah, i usually end up watching them on streaming"
2427,Do you ever go camping? I love nature and love to get outside when I have time off of work.
2427,I go camping when I can. Wish I could go camping in Africa
2427,"Oh really, what appeals to you about camping there?"
2427,just the idea of all of those animals. I like hippos te best
2427,"Yes, Africa has such neat wild life! It would be cool to go camping in some areas of America too, they can have some pretty cool wildlife. "
2427,I dream of being reincarnated as a hippo though
2427,"That's interesting, why? It would be relaxing I guess, hippos don't have to work full time, in the same way as we do"
2427,I just want to try to eat a poacher
2427,"That would be ironic. They are pretty big animals, I wouldn't want to mess with a hippo."
2427,i hear it's the most dangerous animal
2427,It would be cool to see those in the wild. I wonder if it's dangerous to camp in Africa because they have such dangerous wildlife.
2428,Chicken nuggets are the best. God-tier food.
2428,Do you like Mexican food? It's my favorite.
2428,"Oh yes, I love it. I'm starving just thinking about it."
2428,I don't even mind Taco Bell. I love making Mexican at home too.
2428,I've never tried actually. Have you read any good books lately? I really enjoy reading.
2428,"Honestly, I haven't been much of a book reader lately. I used to read more when I was younger."
2428,Alot of people are like that. I dropped off for a while and now i'm going to the library every single week.
2428,That's awesome! I aspire to that.
2428,Anything else going on with you?
2428,Just planning my son's 10th birthday this week. 
2428,"Amazing, I am glad your offspring have survived so long."
2428,"Yes, he's a good kid! Really fun to be around."
2429,Thank you for the kind words. How is your day?
2429,It is absolutely gorgeous outside today.
2429,Nice! It's cloudy where I am. You doing anything for Halloween?
2429,First I am rolling the Tide this weekend and then I am heading for a haunted corn maze.
2429,It'd be awesome to do a corn maze based on the maze from The Shining!
2429,I love that movie. A maze like that would be so much fun.
2429,You seen the South Park episode based on The Shining?
2429,"No, but South Park is so funny. I'll bet they really rocked it."
2429,Do you like Simpsons as well? Are you fluent in Simpsons? :)
2429,I used to watch in the early days but I haven't seen anything in quite awhile. 
2429,"Oh, of course. Seasons 1 - 10 are where it's at. ""Dental plan!"""
2429,I love that they stayed the same ages.
2430,"if I can hide from 5 grandchildren, you can hide from your 4 daughters! lol how old are they?"
2430,"They are 10, 12, 15, and 18, I usually run out to the gym to get away!"
2430,"well, that's a good habit to have!"
2430,"Yeah I am also a older athlete so I have to stay in shape, do you play sports?"
2430,"no, I used to run cross country back in college, but not anymore, I prefer more relaxing activities"
2430,"Yeah I love to relax when I can, how do you relax?"
2430,I love to go fishing on the lake with a nice bottle of wine
2430,"Yeah that sure is relaxing, hopefully some peace and quiet from the grandchildren. "
2430,totally! They're not a big fan of it. How do you relax?
2430,I like listening to music and drinking a glass of wine!
2430,who doesn't? I usually go through 10 bottles a night
2430,Oh wow that's a lot I couldn't finish that much.
2431,No I had a coworker go to Walmart to get me a set of clothes
2431,That was nice of them. Did they pick something you liked
2431,"Yes, she is a very close friend and knows my style. "
2431,Well thats good cause i hate not picking out my own clothes. So how old are you?

2432,what kind of work you do?
2432,I do mostly freelance work online. That's good to hear about your role.
2432,I manage a IT group for a large corporation...
2432,How big of a group is it?
2432,"about 300 people, my group has 12 globally"
2432,Woah! That's a lot of people for sure. You don't find it stressful? 
2432,some times.. managing people is not fun always..
2432,I definitely can imagine. This is also another reason why I prefer working from home.
2432,how is working from home like?
2432,It's really great to be honest. I like the peace of mind I have compared to a regular day job.
2432,what are the other things you in your free time?
2432,"Since I work from home, I try to get outside as much as possible. Could be for a walk, a coffee, anything really."
2433,I was working at a coffee shop so I didnt see what happened
2433,That must really be frustrating knowing your friend did it. 
2433,I am not sure who's at fault..I havent spoken to them 
2433,Well I hope you get things sorted out.
2433,So do I..Do you have any piercings?
2433,I don't but most of my friends that I dance with do. Do you have any. 
2433,I have one on my eyebrow
2433,I'm a night owl that loves dancing but I'm afraid of needles and puncture woulds. 
2433,"I use to love dancing but since I got older, I stopped..Needles dont bother me"
2433,The love for dancing will always be there but the joints don't bend as easy. I can relate. 
2433,Thats my problem too..My joints pop and crackle..
2433,For some reason that made me think of a Rice Krispies commercial.
2433,Thats what I think of too..lol
2434,"Its at Paisley Park. I'll be bringing my fiance. You remember my fiance, dont you?"
2434,"Yes, I do. He even had a half brother called Jim"
2434,"Yes, Jim and my mom might be the only ones in my family attending the wedding. The rest of my family absolutely hates my fiance."
2434,oh so sorry . but i think chicago men are different . i live there
2434,"Yes, Chicago is a great city"
2434,"I love it, especially this time of year. My favorite color is green, but the leaves changing is beautiful."
2434,My favorite thing about Chicago is the variety of food.
2434,"The food is amazing. All different cultures. Italian, German, and my mother's favorite, Greek. "
2434,The best Greek I ever had is a little place in Fort Lauderdale. Amazing
2434,"My mother is from Greece, I grew up eating Greek food."
2434,Nice. My favorite Greek dish is Kleftiko
2434,"My favorite is spanakopita, I learned to make it as a child and my recipe gets better with age."
2435,She's such an amazing singer! Who's your favourite singer?
2435,i really love pink. i relate with all her songs. but i used to swear matchbox 20 wrote for me.lol
2435,She's a good singer too! Is that your favourite song?
2435,my favorite is probably blue 
2435,"i haven't heard that one, is it good?"
2435,im sorry i meant blue by keith urban do u know his music?
2435,"Ah, I don't really no. Is he good?"
2435,yea hes considered country. so what else do you like

2435,um i really love water. isnt that crazy? but i prefer drpepper
2435,That is crazy! Dr pepper is okay I guess.
2435,Do u like halloween? its my favorite time of the year. i just got done decorating.
2436,I'm looking forward to being somewhere new.
2436,You should hike in Montana! It's my favorite place to hike!
2436,I wonder if there are any good places to hike in Kentucky
2436,I have never hiked there. I have only been there by car and got into an accident and lost my arm.
2436,"Oh, wow. I'm sorry. That sounds pretty traumatic."
2436,It was. I'm okay now. It makes you value life!
2436,I bet! At least that won't keep you from hiking.
2436,Very true! I can't imaging not hiking. It's my passion. What's your passion?
2436,I like photography. I'm hoping to find some good places to practice when I'm in college
2436,Wow! How interesting! Where do you go to school?
2436,I'll be going to The University of Kentucky once I graduate.
2436,Good for you! I loved college. The best years of your life will be there!
2437,my favorite band is cody johnson and i go to bed early
2437,"Yeah I like to go to bed early too, but usually I read some of my books before then"
2437,what books do you like to read
2437,"I like romantic novels, do you read?"
2437,i try to when i have time! i love romantic novels 
2437,Yeah it's a great stress relief for sure! I also go to the gym to swim when I can to take my mind off work. How do you destress?
2437,i hang out with my kiddos! they are always fun to be around :) 
2437,Aw that's perfect! How old are they?
2437,i have a 2 and 1 year old!! lol so its constant crazy :) i can only dream of going to the gym for now!! lol
2437,Haha yeah finding the time is hard! Maybe take them to a local pool in the summer it would be a great family activity!
2437,yes!! they will be old enough by summer to go swim :) we live in texas so its pool weather until october !! haha
2437,"Haha wow that's great, I'm up in New York so definitely need to wait till the summer now."
2438,I have no idea what happened! Just a series of bad events.
2438,That's too bad!
2438,"Yes, but in the big picture I guess it doesn't matter much!  Do you like to cook?"
2438,I love cooking! 
2438,What are some of your favorite foods to cook.
2438,Any and all of them! Do you like dogs? I have one.
2438,Love dogs! I have a Maltipoo. What kind is yours?
2438,"A strange, hairless one. He has a cute little red sweater because it's my favorite color."
2438,"That sounds cute. It is starting to get cold here, I need to get my little guy a sweater too."
2438,It is starting to freeze!
2438,What part of the country are you in?
2438,"Appalachia, way up high."
2439,What do you do?
2439,I work at a pet store.  I love animals.  I'm even vegetarian because I love them so much.
2439,"oh cool!  I love my animals too, I love to take my dog running with me. "
2439,"Unfortunately, even though I love animals, I'm allergic to pet dander."
2439,"oh no, that's horrible.  does it not affect you at work?"
2439,Yes.  Very much.  I have to wear a mask and take medicine.  I'm really in the wrong line of work. haha
2439,"yes, that sounds like a lot to do.  I'm not sure I could or would do that.   Have you looked for other animal related jobs?"
2439,Not really.  I just got a job there because my mom owns the store and I'm in school.
2439,"That's convenient, I had a restaurant when my kids were teens, they hated it.  lol"
2439,I bet.  I've done restaurant work too.  What do you do now?
2439,"Now I sell insurance, it's super boring"
2439,I get bored even trying to pay my insurance bill online.  I can imagine.  I'm sure you make decent money though.
2439,have a great day!
2440,I'd love to be a superhero!  I'd like to be one that gets paid though!  lol   I love money especially when it pays the bills.
2440,Exactly.  Good lovin don't pay the bills
2440,No it doesn't.  I have plenty of love with my brown eyes but love doesn't pay the bills. You are right.
2440,I wish I was a superhero to cure all Cancers etc..or make the money to donate
2440,That's great!  That shows you are a good person!  I'd like to be one for the same reason.  I'm very selfless.
2440,Thank you. I like to stay humble and keep good morals
2440,I'm the same way.  I try to be the best person that I can be.
2440,i try to have the same mentality i can achieve what i strive for
2440,I live my life in the way that God would want me to.
2440,God has always been pt first in my life because he  the Supreme Being
2440,Exactly!  God is life!  He loves us no matter what we do.
2440,"i love God . he's my strength and yes, I agree"
2441,"nah, he's a lazy bum"
2441,He may be a lazy bum but at least he is doing alright for himself.
2441,I guess I just have a higher standard nwo that I'm looking to start my own business
2441,I've never heard of nwo. What is it?
2441,"I'm sorry, that was a typo, I meant ""now"""
2441,So what kind of business are you trying to start?
2441,An SEO service...do you know anything about computers? 
2441,Not much knowledge outside of common use.
2441,it's just a way to get websites to the top of the search list
2441,like to the top of google and other search engines?
2441,"yeah, like that.....to drive more people to a website"
2442,"Going shopping with my daughters, its one of my favorite things to do. You?"
2442,i 3 teenagers. not my fav thing to do. lol to much money. I really love spending time with them. we are decorating today.
2442,Thats really cool. Sounds like a lot of fun. Decorating is always fun. Are yall decorating for Halloween?
2442,yes its my favorite time of the year. such great imagination. 
2442,Thats great. I am a foodie and love food. Do you have any typical things you make for Thanksgiving
2442,nothing but normal stuff. my best desert is cherry delight. its so good and easy. the turkey is always stuffed and basted
2442,Sounds really good. Is cherry delight a pie?
2442,"no its mixed fruit in the cans, cherries fresh, and 2 tubs of whipped cream. i make the cream home made. and u just mix it all.whats your fav"
2442,Oh okay. We call that fruit salad where I come from. :) Yum very good stuff.
2442,oh lol that makes sense only this is more cherry red cause of the fresh cherries. so what do u make special
2442,Fried turkey is my favorite part of Thanksgiving. But pies mostly. Homemade pumpkin pie is the fav.
2442,i love homemade pecan pie. My husband makes it from scratch with pecans he picks and shells himself.
2443,"Yes, we used to play cards together, or listen to my favorite music genre, Classic Rock"
2443,That's sounds like a good experience you both had. I am sure she  is happy right now.
2443,"Yes, it takes the sting away from her passing."
2443,"I undestand sometimes it is difficult do deal with emotions, but if you know the truth it is mach easy to deal with the situation. "
2443,"Luckily, we did alot together so I have good times to remember. "
2443,That is for sure. I am sure she used to cook some good food. One of my favorite food is chocolate cake. What about you? 
2443,"Italian food, for sure. Although I am trying to avoid carbs."
2443,Are you trying to lose some weight or you just keeping yourself toned? 
2443,"I am trying to lose weight. Italian food and chocolate cake are best for that, right?"
2443,"Well not really, unless you exercise your body. By the way do you exercise?"
2443,I try to!
2443,Remember consistent work always pays off. Consistency is the key to success. 
2444,I did not know that.
2444,It's not normal information I'll admit but it's certainly interesting.
2444,"I mean, what is normal information? Information is information; it may be trivial but it's information."
2444,"A good point. In any case, blue is very awesome in how it's just barely within our sight.  Also the word 'violet' used to mean 'blue'"
2444,"As does azure and azul, in French and Spanish. Blue light is very noticable at night even if it is not bright."
2444,"Oh blue in the night sky makes Midnight Blue, the best version of blue."
2444,"Midnight blue is a beautiful shade, I agree. This is my favorite word for blue since it is funny sounding: lapis lazuli, it means blue rock. A very popular stone."
2444,Ooh. I also read that distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called atmospheric perspective.
2444,"I know this is true; blue stands out a lot to me, especially in digital photos."
2444,"If you look at a far away place, like from a mountain, you'll notice it gains a blue tint. The 'blue' of the sky isn't just some fill in color."
2444,I do love to look off high places to see what I can see.
2444,You probably also look at blue birds as well and that's caused by their black wings scattering the light.
2445,I'm a senior animator at Cartoon Network. I love drawing
2445,I wish I was talented in the arts! I have never been creative.
2445,I get my talent from my grandfather. He was an artist from Greece. My family came from greece during the 1950's
2445,Wow that is so interesting! Do you and your family like motorcycles? I am in a motorcycle club and love it!
2445,I don't know much about motorcycles. What kind of motorcycles do you like?
2445,I love Harleys! People know I am strong on that and as such I have never lost a fight!
2445,Cool. I'm more of car person myself. Have you ever driven a Tesla before?
2445,"I haven't, but they look cool! Do you have one?"
2445,"No, but I have driven a Tesla Model 3. The acceleration speed was crazy"
2445,I bet! Must be much faster than my motorcycle!
2445,The only downside is the range of it. There arent alot of electric recharge centers in my state
2445,That is a huge bummer. Charging at home is expensive.
2446,They usually have amazing produce as well. I know my local place is usually stocked with a variety of veggies to choose from.
2446,I love going to farmer's markets. My adopted dad takes me.
2446,"That's great. My grandkids usually don't come with me, but I go with my husband most of the time."
2446,I'm sure they'd love it! I know I've loved it since I was a baby.
2446,What made you love it so much as a kid? Most kids these days are so into their cellphones and stuff.
2446,"Just all the interesting foods around. I'm very into technology in general also, my dad works at HP."
2446,What does your dad do at HP?
2446,He makes sure the computers work before they hit the shelves. 
2446,That's probably an intense job in itself.
2446,"Probably, but he gets alot of neat stuff out of it."
2446,"Things to modify the computer at home with, I take it?"
2446,"yeah , anything to do with computers ."
2447,"It is your baby, the human baby"
2447,"Oh silly me, sorry I misunderstood your message haha. "
2447,"It's okay, mistakes happen. Do you read to your baby?"
2447,"Every night before bed. As the youngest of three, I have great memories of story time before bed with my siblings."
2447,That's so great. I think it's important to encourage a love of reading at a young age. It sounds like you're doing a good job!
2447,"Sometimes I read law books, I'm pursuing my degree, and the baby doesn't understand me! Haha"
2447,Law can be confusing even for adults! I can't say I blame the baby. 
2447,"At least we are getting quality bonding time, even if the baby doesn't understand it all."
2447,"That's true. It's all about the connection. Speaking of connections, I've recently connected with a popular publisher. I may be releasing my first book soon!"
2447,Congratulations! That is quite the accomplishment!
2447,Thank you! It's not a done deal yet. But it does feel like a big step in the right direction. 
2447,Definitely. Congratulations and good luck!
2448,"They are very hard to come by at times. I only work part time, but still can't find the balance. What do you do for a living? "
2448,"I work training animals. It's a fun job, but a lot of work. What do you do?"
2448,"I work part time at a book store. It's a good job, but the money could be better if you know what I mean. "
2448,yes . i definitely know what you mean .
2448,I sale some oil paintings on the side to make ends meet. I'm working on one of a koala right now. They're my favorite. What's yours? \
2448,"The parrots are the best, because they are so human-like. I've never trained a Koala, though!"
2448,I'd love to meet one in person. They're so adorable. Do you train parrots to talk? 
2448,"We do! and to do tricks, like riding little bikes. The kids love it"
2448,I bet it's adorable! Do you train a lot of parrots? 
2448,We rescue them. Some have special needs or aren't adoptable because they can bite
2448,Aww... That's sad. Are they biters because their owners abused them? 
2448,I am not sure but I do know they can be stubborn.
2449,I agree but its what babies do
2449,"Babies will be babies.  It's still disgusting though!  I'd be like, ""Honey can't we just have a dog?"" lol"
2449,I laughed out loud on that comment..I would agree..lol
2449,Well people sometimes say that I could be a kid since I'm very short...lol   I get around in a wheelchair though.
2449,Bless your heart..what happened if you dont mind me asking?
2449, I was in a really bad car accident when I was younger. It was a very bad time in my life.
2449,so sorry to hear that..I am glad to see God brought you through it 
2449,Me too!  God is #1 in my life!
2449,Mine too..Amen 
2449,Yes! I pray alot asking God to guide me in my life!
2449,He will too and I will pray for you ..God bless
2449,Thank you so much.  There is no love like God's.
2450,No.  But I do love flowers.  They're kind of my pets.  Haha
2450,I enjoy flowers too.  They definitely require their own kind of attention and care.
2450,"I have had pets before, and have loved them, but it's so hard when they get ill or pass away."
2450,I understand. I have had pets pass away as well.  It's tough to deal with.
2450,What sort of cat would you like?  An adult cat?  A kitten?  Kittens are so cute.
2450,I would prefer a fully grown cat.  One that already knows its way around the world.
2450,"Right.  My mother is allergic to cats, so I think I may like to get a puppy."
2450,Puppies are great!  They have no end to the amount of love they can show you.
2450,True. Very loyal.  But they can be so destructive to furniture and floors and stuff.
2450,"Yeah, it's important to make sure they are trained. Definitely need to get them housebroken too."
2450,That's true.  Sometimes my mother is such a handful on her own I wonder if I could even handle a puppy.
2450,"Puppies are definitely easy, they just require a bit of attention and love."
2451,I also have a Tabby cat it's so large right now though.
2451,"I am a big cat person. Love them, they are all so cute."
2451,Me too! They usually don't like my affection but they're great. Mine needs to lose some weight though.
2451,lol. Do you collect anything ?
2451,"I have a big collection of books right now, I'm trying to move out of my apartment so I can't take them all with me! "
2451,"Very nice. Reading is so fun, and educational. My collection is teapots I love to collect them. They can be very different."
2451,Oh wow! Are they all very unique?
2451,"I collect them from all different parts of the world, when I travel. They are all one of a kind."
2451,Wow that must be a very precious and valuable collection :)
2451,It really is. Do you get to travel at all?
2451,"Sometimes! I get 3 weeks vacation, and recently I went to New York."
2451,"Oh wow. Busy, busy place that is. So many people."
2452,How old are you ? do you want kids?
2452,"I'm in my 40's, raised my partners kids. I'm done"
2452,"There's nothing wrong with that, enjoy all the freedom you can. Have you been on any nice vacations lately??"
2452,"no, and so I can't wait for my next one. how about you?"
2452,"I'm planning to go on a nice cruise sooner or later, aiming for next year ! ive never been some very excited to start planning."
2452,ive always wanted to go on a cruise
2452,Oh yeah! it has so much to do from the ad's ive seen lately. they have different activites
2452,"most definitely , along with the beautiful scenery"
2452,Oh yes! Just the overall experience would be very nice and relaxing a bit.
2452,"It would be nice, on a boat too"
2452,Oh yeah! party on the boat and then relax on the island lol
2452,"exactly , nice way to wind down"
2453,I thought it would be a good thing to do and it made sense at the time. Oh well. What do you like to do to relax?

2458,I currently work in the local library as i love reading so i thought it would be the perfect place to work
2458,That's a nice occupation. You probably see different people all the time.
2459,I should have broken his arm! I've been through two so I know how it would have felt.
2459,Hopefully the police got involved
2459,I think they will. We called them and apprehended the guy.

2459,"So on a lighter note, do you have any siblings? I grew up with 6!"
2459,I do! I have a younger brother and sister!
2459,Sometimes it gets overwhelming trying to stay in touch with all 6 of my siblings.
2459,Yeah I bet ! That must be difficult .
2459,"I have a pretty close relationship with all 6, surprisingly. But we had a good upbringing. Are you close with your siblings>"
2459,"They live in Minnesota so I don't see them often, living in Tennessee. Where do you live?"
2459,"I'm from southern Florida. Most of my siblings live close by, but my oldest brother lives in Texas."
2459,"I love Texas. It's so hot there, though."
2460,"Oh, I hate when that happens! "
2460,"Yes, It feels disgusting. Can't wait to smell fresh again. What did you shop for today?"

2461,"But I do love beef and potatoes. And chicken, and pork..."

2461,"I am a Texan and I love Mexican food the most, pratically raised on it. And I had a Mexican wife for seven years as well so that was nice."
2461,Have you ever had the Mexican street food?
2461,"Yes I have, many times. That is the most authentic Mexican food, in Mexican resturants it is more Tex-Mex, which is still good."
2461,Tex-Mex is one of the best cuisines out there since you get the  best of American and Mexican!
2461,"Yep, and in Texas we've got plenty of Mexican food choices! I feel sorry for northerners."
2461,Lol yes. The southeast is a nice place to live. Although mostly I just really love our food.
2461,"We've also got really good Cajun food in places, especially SE and East Texas."
2461,"I love Cajun food, but Louisiana has the best, not Texas.  I'm sure its good there though. "
2461,"Oh yeah, Louisiana most def has the best I just mean the closer you get to the TX/LA border it gets better. But we have Pappadeauxs to lol."
2461,"Awesome,  People underestimate Louisiana,  I love baton rogue"
2462,Wow.  Wouldn't that be nice!  I do love game shows.
2462,so basically contestants solve word puzzles similar to theose used in hangman to win cash and prizes determined by spinning a giant carnival wheel
2462,Right.  Do you watch Wheel of Fortune?  Or Jeopardy?
2462,"I used to watch those, not lately thou"
2462,Yeah.  They are kind of old school.  That one guy on Jeopardy was very impressive though.  Almost set the record.
2462,"oh yea , do you like puzzles ? i enjoy them"
2462,Yes.  I was just recently in London visiting my mother and we worked three puzzles!
2462,Are you from UK?

2462,No way.  Me too!  For real. haha
2463,Yea leather is awesome.  I love the smell of leather especially when it's new.
2463,Leather is a very sturdy product - I like to buy it.
2463,"I agree.  I love my leather seats in my car.  Speaking of my car, I love to drink it fast just as fast as I drive my motorcycle."
2463,Do you currently own a Yamaha?
2463,lol I said drink my car...I meant drive my car fast.  I own a Honda actually.
2463,"Ah, Honda is a great brand - does it have leather seats?"
2463,It does!  And my seats are so comfy!
2463,That's great to hear - leather seats are arguably the most comfortable
2463,Yes they are!  I can't imagine sitting on anything else other than my leather seats.
2463,I imagine it's a pretty smooth ride!
2463,Very smooth!  I like to take road trips just to enjoy a great time!
2463,Roads trips are great in terms of getting away!
2464,Any current prospects?
2464,Not that I can see. Being male in this day and age is sort of challenging at times. It'll be alright.
2464,That's good to hear! Keep your confidence up.
2464,I'll try! Anything going on with you? I just leased a new car.
2464,What did you lease? I'm going to be looking for a new car in a few months.
2464,"a Honda Civic, nothing fancy."
2464,"Honda makes great cars. I had a Honda Accord once, but I've switched to a Toyota Camry."
2464,Awesome! how does it do?
2464,"It is fantastic. I get excellent gas mileage, and I never have to do anything to it except for routine maintenance."
2464,"That's amazing, I might look into that in the future."
2464,Check oiut the deals around Memorial Day - great discounts and zero percent financing!
2464,Awesome! thanks!

2465,How many people are coming over?
2465,Eight people and me will be there. 
2465,I'd suggest a large one-pot pasta that you can set in the middle of the table. 
2465,That sounds yummy. I could do some kale salad for the first course. Maybe I can make homemade bread to go with it. Do you enjoy baking? 
2465,I do. I love making bread. A few tear-and-share foccacias would go well with the pasta. Balsamic dressing for the salad?
2465,Yes to the balsamic. That tear-and-share sounds yummy too. Whats your favorite bread to bake? 
2465,"I do enjoy the classic farmhouse loaf, but a good soda bread is divine! What about yours?"
2465,I think it's sourdough. I have a starter that always turns out some good loaves. All this talk about food is making me hungry. 
2465,"I know what you mean! I've not long eaten, but now I want to get in the kitchen again"
2465,Me too. What are you having for dinner tonight? 
2465,Sweet and sour chicken with rice. I add marmalade to the sauce for some extra tang.
2466,I really love zumba so I was hoping to catch a class that was happening
2466,I love it too..Seems things never go as planned when you want something
2466,I know my boss can be alittle strict when it comes to getting off early
2466,"Yes, I can relate..I have a boss just like that too"
2466,"Lol, and I don't think he would approve of my reason.  I don't Zumba classes fall under the ok reason to leave work"
2466,LOL Yea good point
2466,So are you into fitness?
2466,Yes I am big on fitness..I just lost 100 lbs this year
2466,That is awesome!  You must be so proud of yourself.  I could definetly stand to lose some weight.
2466,Thank you I am proud but it was either lose weight or die..sadly
2466,Well 100 lbs is amazing and now that you know you can do it that is great motivation to keep going
2466,Thanks for the extra motivation!
2467,"That is very,very true. What type of music do you like? Right now I enjoy smooth jazz."

2467,Wow it must never be dull.  I bet it can be stressful though for sure.  do you enjoy it
2467,"Its fine sometimes, but other times it is very stressful. Do you have hobbies?"
2467,Well I guess this isn't a hobby per se but I am taking a class to learn Spanish.  I have always wanted to learn a second language
2467,One could say that is a hobby. lol. It is very good to know and understand Spanish these days.
2467,what about you do you have hobbies
2467,"Not really per se. lol. If you include teenage kids as a hobby, then yes I have three. lol"
2467,"lol, well that would deffinetly take alot of your time.  "

2468,Do you see that as a positive or negative? 
2468,"definitely a negative, my health is terrible"
2468,I'm sorry to hear that. Have you thought about seeing a doctor or perhaps looking at dieting options>
2468,"yeah, I started a keto diet"
2468,That's good. Have you seen small results from it so far? Have you also been exercising to pair with your diet?
2468,I've seen larger results. lost 30 pounds in 2 months eating right and jogging
2468,That's amazing! I'd say you're on the right path then. 
2468,thanks for the support.

2468,I like to fish. it's quiet and peaceful
2468,Have you caught anything big lately? I personally love to play video games.

2469,Yes. I love their music. Tool is awesome. 
2470,"I remember my district of New York, almost like walking through the set of The Godfather, except not being in the mafia!"
2470,I can't stand the Godfather! lol   I'm much more into Disney movies.  I'm not going to lie.  Ariel is my favorite princess.
2470,Disney can be fun. I prefer Belle to Ariel though. 
2470,I love Belle too!  I loved it when her and the Beast danced..lol   I am on a competitive dance team so I love to dance.
2470,What type of dancing do you do?

2470,Absolutely! I enjoy having a good party! Have you hosted any house parties?
2470,I have not!  I'd much rather go to a party because I'm too lazy to fix food lol
2471,I don't make a lot of money right now I'm unemployed so it's tough.
2471,In this economy it is tough for everyone. As much as i love math i hate dealing with budgets.
2471,"Yeah budgets are tough, I've got to set one for myself for sure. Do you have any hobbies?"
2471,Yeah i love to play soccer! it helps me work out all my stress.
2471,"That's a great way to destress, I love writing books."
2471,Oh wow that sound very fulfilling. I wish i had the patience.
2471,"Yeah it's tough, but I'm trying to finish it by the end of the year so I have to get moving."
2471,Moving sure can be rough. How much more do you have left to write?
2471,I have about 3 chapters so it should be ok I'm hoping!
2471,You'll get there! This will be a great accomplishment for you.
2471,thank you! I can't wait to hopefully be published one day.
2471,It would be so cool to see your book on the best seller list.
2472,i used to think the same thing but then i tried it and really liked it

2473,"Really? Nice to hear, I like the classics, but I'm open to remakes. "
2473,I prefer the classics too! What is your favorite movie of all time?
2473,Oh man that is a hard one. I'd say The Godfather 2.  It is a sequel and prequel all wrapped up in 1. 
2473,Oh. I have never seen that series before. I have heard good things though. 
2473,"That is a must watch series for any film lover, it is the staple mafia series. Lots of drama and great writing. "
2473,That's awesome! I will have to give them a watch sometime. 
2473,"The all star cast is straight fan fiction for any film lover. Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando"
2473,"Yes. I am aware of who the cast is. What else do you like to do, besides watch movies?"
2473,"Well I'm a pretty big gamer, waiting for The Last Of Us 2, but it got delayed again to May 2020."
2473,"Oh, why is it delayed?"
2473,"Who knows, likely to polish up the title as its Sony's big earner. The first game moved 20 million units so I think they just want perfection."
2474,"yes, i love the outdoors as i am always looking for wildlife when i'm outside hiking!"
2474,"me too, the wildlife is amazing. you never know what you'll see out there"
2474,"yeah, i'm also looking for a dog so i've been visiting the animal shelter recently. Do you like dogs?"
2474,I love dogs. I actually have two. I take them hiking with me. What kind are you looking for?
2474,i don't know. i just want one that will love me and be my best friend. Do you have any suggestions? what kind of dogs do you havd?
2474,"I have a husky and a saint bernard. I really love big dogs, they are the best for cuddling and make me feel safe. "
2474,I love the way husky's look. sort of like a wolf. I might get one of those.
2474,"If you like wolves, you should look into getting a wolfdog! They are also known as Ethiopian wolves."
2474,"no way, really? and they're domesticated? i gotta take a look at them on google."
2474,I believe they are domesticated! I've seen a few videos of them on the internet.
2474,omg they're huuge! i just saw a few pictures on google. i didn't know they were a thing haha
2474,Aren't they amazing?! I bet they shed like crazy though!
2475,Yes Columbia is good.  What do you do?
2475,i am just a student currently but hoping to study law as well
2475,Study hard it's tough to get into a good law school.  What are you majoring in now?
2475,"I originally wanted to get a BA in economics, but then decided I'd be better off studying criminal justice, so that's what I'm doing now"
2475,"That's good, always something to fall back on.  "
2475,"that's true , especially in this economy"
2475,"economy's doing great, lots of jobs out there these days.  "
2475,oh really? I can't seem to think that way. What do you find good about the economy?
2475,"Lots of jobs, upward mobility, tax breaks, it's a lot better than it's been in years."
2475,"Yeah, that's true. However, as a student I can't seem to pay for rent, tuition, bills, etc with my part-time job wage"
2475,"that's a lot to ask of a part time job.  sorry to hear that, wish you the best"
2475,thanks i wish you the same with your studies !
2476,Thanks I feel confident it will be good.  I'm trying a new recipe tonight.

2476,I'm trying an Indian dish tonight.
2476,Does it have curry in it? I've never really tried Indian food much.
2476,It is supposed to have curry but given my recent health issues I will go very light on the curry.
2476,What issues have you had? 
2476,Some digestive issues.  I will be glad when the tests are done and they can give me some medicine to take care of it.
2476,Then that way you can have all the curry you want!
2476,Exactly!  It is difficult to watch what I eat so as not to irritate my stomach.
2476,I've had issues like that in the past. It can be irritating to find something that doesn't bother your stomach.
2476,"Yes, especially since I enjoy cooking so many different cuisines!"

2478,"Oh many kinds, like blue fish, rock fish, croakers and flounders."
2478,That sounds awesome.  Do you have to travel far to go fishing?
2478,"Got it. Its just that when I talk about fishing, I get carried away."
2478,How so?
2478,"Well it is my favorite hobby and I have 3 great friends I always fish with. One day, we caught 167 fish!"

2481,that sounds painful .piercing isn't for you then 
2481,Nope but I do love poetry!  I write poems when I can
2481,wow that is awesome. how long have you been writing
2481,About 5 years now.  I never was sure if they were good enough so I wouldn't show anyone
2481,lol.. never can tell how good you are if you dont show people your work criticism makes you perfect
2481,"yes, very true.  It's just scary you know.  do you like poetry"
2481,yes but am not really into it.. i love arts
2481,Like going to art museus
2482,i love animals
2482,"Me too! He's a beautiful color orange, my favorite!"
2482,I heard that those orange tabby's are mostly male for some genetic reason. Seems your cat is too
2482,Yes it is male that is correct! Do you have a cat?
2482,"i don't currently, but i have before. they're so fun to watch. I do have a dog right now though."
2482,Aw cute! dogs are great. Are you working right now?
2482,"I am working right now....I'm a dental assistant, in a fancy part of town. pay is good, people are terrible though"
2482,"Ouu yes it's tough to be in a nice town with those kind of people..I am a barista, the money isn't very good."
2482,but the stories you must have! retail and service industry is crazy
2482,Yes retail is a great place to be for stories lol!!
2483,Are you into cooking as well?
2483,"Yes, I like to treat myself in the kitchen.  "
2483,what kind of food are you mostly interested in making?
2483,"I like Italian, pizza's and pasta's.  and grilling meat, mmmmm"
2483,do you like spicy food?
2483,"Very much.  I am in Texas now, far from home and I love spicy Tex-Mex food."
2483,where the home is?
2483,"New York, not much spicy food there."
2483,what would be you pizza preference.. NY or Chicago?
2483,"New York, between those 2, but I love Detroit style the most. "
2483,That's good... I never hear of Detroit style 
2483,"it's cooked in a square pan, with cheese over the top of the crust, going down between the pan and the crust.  "
2484,I prefer going to the theater to watch plays than movies. The acting is a lot better.
2484,"Agreed, though actors don't have to use props or magic tricks or anything like that to "
2484,"That and with movies, they edit around a performance. "
2484,yea the cgi in movies is stellar.
2484,"If you do want to walk some more, you should go to a park. The nice setting will get your mind off of the activity of walking sometimes."
2484,Good idea.  I just have to get motivated.  I could eat pizza and walk at the same time!
2484,Haha that's the spirit!
2484,But can't have a beer at the park. What was the last play you saw at the theater?
2484,Death of a Salesman. 
2484,I bet that was good.  I'd like to see The Godfather on the stage.
2484,I'm not sure if they've done a play of it. The Godfather is a great movie though.
2484,Yeah a classic and my all time favorite movie.
2485,"It's worth it, the Keto diet works. "
2485,I’ve done keto before but I love carbs too much 
2485,"I do too, but I've already lost 16 lbs. It's making me stick with it!"
2485,That’s awesome. Maybe I’ll give it a go again 
2485,"I'm a juggler in a circus, so I have to be fit. "
2485,"That’s a really interesting job. I work in a shop, really boring I know. How did you get a job in a circus ?"
2485,I was a gymnast and went to circus school. I auditioned with Cirque du Soleil and got in. 
2485,Wow your job is so much cooler than mine. I’d love to go see Cirque du Soleil. I like the thing with people spinning on ribbons 
2485,Yes it's a fun job. What kind of shop do you work in?
2485,It’s a Co-op convience store. We are surrounded by student halls so we’re always really busy. I hate it but money is money 
2485,That sounds like an okay way to spend your day. At least you're not stuck in a cubicle. 
2485,I bought a tiny Bluetooth earbud online so I can listen to podcasts while I work without anyone knowing.
2486,"I'm not a singer, I play the guitar."
2486,"That's really interesting, do you play lead or rhythm? "
2486,I play rhythm and the sessions are insane!
2486,Sweet! What genre do you like to play the best? I kind of like everything. 
2486,"I can do everything, but I like rock the best."
2486,Anything I've heard of? 
2486,"Not yet, we're still in the studio working with the Record producer."
2486,"Nice, I'm insanely jealous!"
2486,"Sweet, it is nice, but it's a lot of work!"
2486,"Ha, I bet! Probably a lot of coffee involved."
2486,"For sure, the hours are grueling. But it's worth it!"
2486,It sounds really rewarding.
2486,Very!
2487,Less risk of a headache. They're the worst
2487,I use to get headaches but now I am taking Botox injections which help so much
2487,I've heard that from many people. Is it expensive?
2487,Well it can be but luckily my insurance approved it
2487,"My medication plan with my insurance is not ideal, unfortunuately.  I'll still ask my doctor though!"
2488,"Thanks for your concern, she got in an accident a month ago."
2488,"Sounds terrible, how did that happen?"
2488,We like to ride bikes and she got into an accident.
2488,"Sounds terrible, hope she gets better soon"
2488,"Thank you very much, I appreciate the well wishes."
2488,"You are welcome, keep your head up"
2488,"I'll try, its hard sometimes, i'm sure you can relate."
2488,"Oh most definitely ,it is hard, I do not see my daughter much now she moved off to school"
2488,"I'm sure that is hard, glad she's continuing her education though."
2488,I hope she finishes school. She's in Computer Science.
2488,"Great field, good for her!"
2488,"She always had an interest in it, I think she got it from me. "
2489,"I always had a taste for expensive items, so I did what I thought I had to get things"
2489,Lol. Well I guess you have to pay the cost to be the boss. I did the same in my day.
2489,you see we are just entrepreneurs. that mentality tends to rub people the wrong way though. like my sister in law
2489,"Oh? Dang, guess she is kind of wack. I always felt like a super hero personally. Like batman."
2489,"she thinks im more like the joker, but that's only because im freaking hilarious"
2489,Hahaha she should be more harley quinn then. Live a little maybe? 
2489,"nah she's bitter because we used to date but she was a terrible human being, so I married her sister"
2489,You used to date your sister in law? That is intense! <3
2489,yeah buddy. can't believe how different the two sisters were. maybe they had different dad 
2489,"The milk man strikes again!! I mean so long as you are in a better situation, I guess it is what it is."
2489,im happy. you should see a family get together though. awkward...
2489,Well I suppose the price of your happiness is a couple of days of akwardness? Guess you got off kind of light by some metrics. 
2490,I guess I never realized it was named for Queen Victoria
2490,"That is alright, i'm a big history and poltics buff so of course I would know the answer. "
2490,That's cool. What is your favorite era in history to read about?
2490,I find the American revolution fascinating. 
2490,I'm a bit of a romantic myself so I tend to go more for fictional literature
2490, No shame in that.I work at a candy store and make interesting treats. Sometimes I make candy themed from fictional books.
2490,Wow! That sounds like so much fun! Do you make any Harry Potter candy treats?
2490,Yes! 
2490,I bet you get to be really creative in your job. 
2490,"Yes, it is such fun. Have you ever baked or made candy?"
2490,Only some chocolate treats at the holidays. 
2490,"Nice, I like to make fudge during the holidays. "
2491,Me too. I need to start using online payments instead.
2491,"Oh thats a good idea, you'll make sure you won't miss any bills in the future"
2491,I've also been trying to get my parents to use online payments but they are still old school.
2491,"yeah, it's hard to get older generations to use technology, especially when they don't trust it"
2491,Yep and as immigrants my parents are very suspicious.
2491,"oh wow, I can just imagine! But they would love how convenient online payments are"
2491,"Yes.  I usually use online, not sure why I haven't switched this one bill to online.  Lazy perhaps!"
2491,"I see, online is such a convenience but if things get delayed or don't work it becomes an issue."
2491,"So far I haven't had any issues with online payments, perhaps I have just been lucky so far."
2491,"oh, that's lucky of you! I've had credit card information stolen when buying hockey gear online"
2491,Ouch.  Sorry to hear.  Makes you so mad that people would do that.
2491,"Yeah, I know right? But in over 5 years of using online payments only one issue so far, it's worth it"
2491,Nice chatting. Gotta go now.
2491,This was the most fun chat Ive had today. Enjoy yur day!
2492,1 and a half haha
2492,aww I bet you guys were so excited
2492,We were! I just hope she doesn't walk out of the house and into the city like that one movie haha
2492,So do you work outside the home?  I am a retired school teacher
2492,"My husband is the breadwinner,  but I do make money through a variety of means like doing exercise videos on youtube and stuff."
2492,and don't forget Mturk!  LOL!
2492,Yeah of course haha
2492,This gives me something to do since I no longer work.  I also am taking spanish lessons
2492,That's awesome! How would you say your level of Spanish has gotten to?
2492,"LOL, I just started so not to far yet but I really enjoy it and hope I can learn alot"
2492,It's a beautiful language.
2492,do you know any other languages
2493,"You're right. Most books I have read about keeping the heart healthy, discourages running."
2493,"I enjoy nature so I take long hikes, great exercise if you want to get out the house and just enjoy being outdoors."
2493,"I love nature too. i was a Boy Scout and went camping a lot. Now, I have to limit my exercising after my heart attack."
2493,"Oh yeah, That's a very good idea. don't want to put alot of strain on your heart. I've always loved the girls and boy scouts such fun!"
2493,"I actually just dance in place while watching TV. I do it 30 minutes,  7 days a week."
2493,"Oh Thats a great idea, I love to dance. you could try some relaxing yoga as well."
2493,I never tried Yoga but I did try tai chi. I still prefer dancing to music. It exercises my body and my mind.
2493,"Oh ive heard of Tai chi, but never really tried it i may research that! "
2493,I read that dancing is more effective than walking for the heart. It is also more enjoyable.
2493,Oh yeah how about roller blading?
2493,"Oh, I'm too old for that. I'm 81 years old and I think it is too dangerous for me. However, a roller skated when I was young."
2493,"You not too old! but i completely understand can't take no risk, just have to keep thing simple and enjoyable!"
2494,I do not. I prefer to spend my free time sketching characters
2494,"Drawing is fun, I like it, too. Do you play mario cart? I like to drive fast, so it's lots of fun!"
2494,"I have never played before, but I am thinking about trying out the new one on android!"
2494,Me too 
2494,"I take things too literally, including speed limits. Would be nice to ignore those rules!"
2494,"Wouldn't it, though? LOL That's why video games are so good. Because you don't have to worry about getting hurt or nearly dying; thats' not fun."
2494,"Exactly! If you can't do it in life, you can on Playstation. Ha!"
2494,Exactly!  What else do you like to do?
2494,"I am a writer for a local newspaper, as well as contributor to a political podcast. Information overload!"
2494,Wow! Yes indeed haha! What types of news articles do you write?
2494,I stick to local stories for the paper. Much less drama than the politics of it all.
2494,I agree bc politics are getting really touchy these days.
2495,you mean the special one in school...:)
2495,well thanks. i am more into video games than drinking
2495,video games are fun.. what is your favorate?
2495,horror survival games are my favorite. i am excited for the last of us 2 to come out
2495,really! sounds like exciting...
2495,"yeah, do you play any video games?"
2495,Nope! I love hiking in my free time
2495,that is something i definitely wish i could do more of. maybe once i'm out of college and move away i will be somewhere more accessible to stuff like that
2495,The college life is too short
2495,That depends. Grad school definitely makes it feel as if it is taking forever
2495,I know right
2495,what did you go to school for?
2496,Sometimes.  I'm glad I live in an area that has public transit though.  What's your preferred method of travel?
2496,i like to hitchhike . it is something i enjoy . kinda scary as well .
2496,Seems like it would be!  Where's the last place you hitchhiked to?
2496,"all over the us . if you can name it , i've probably been down it"
2496,Wow!  That's awesome!  What's the coolest place you've been to?
2496,interior of australia . hot . dry . lots of dangerous things .
2496,"Australia is the capital of dangerous. lol  What do you do when you get there, do you camp or find a place to stay?"
2496,It's a two night trip in the mountains. We do have cabins so it's not actually camping in the wilderness.
2496,Still sounds like a good time.  I love camping myself.
2496,"Definitely, especially when you have a cabin to cozy up in when you need a break from the outdoors."
2496,I'm sure.  My favorite place to camp is the beach. =)
2496,"I've heard that you can camp on the beach, but I've never done it, myself."
2497,They're especially good with freshly caught fish.
2497,Would make perfect sense. Also correlates to why seaweed is so commonly used with sushi. They seem to be quite a tasty paring.
2497,It really is. I cooked up a trout I caught last weekend and had the seaweed with it. It was awesome.
2497,What kind? I prefer speckled trout over all over varieties.
2497,"Speckled is great! This was a rainbow trout though, it's what the river near me mostly stocks."
2498,wow what led to your passion in philosophy
2498,I like understanding the logic in arguing. I like to argue
2498,that is funny .. sounds like something tough
2498,it's not too bad once you understand how the arguments fit together
2498,yeah but you need facts to back up the premises of your argument
2498,philosophy deals more in abstract concepts than in facts so it's really just mostly about how you can explain your concept based on the rules of logic
2498,but one needs to avoid hasty generalizations to really  sound convincing
2498,That's a good point.
2498,philosophy a cool discipline for people who can think
2498,what do you study? 
2498,studied human resources management
2498,That sounds cool. Where did you study at?
2499,yes i agree my daughter has braces and she loves candy but eats way less now with them on!
2499,Seriously. It has also helped me eat more vegeterian food. 
2499,I believe it! Don't you feel better when you don't eat meat though? 
2499,Yes! Totally want to give up eating all animal products. 
2499,Me too it's just so hard to get my family on board but I definitely try to make more plant based meals these days!
2499,What is your favorite vegeterian meal to make?
2499,"Quinoa salad with cucumber and tomato and cilantro, parsley and mint for fresh herbs. You should try it!"
2499,Definitely! My favorite is a spaghetti squash meal with red sauce and vegan meat. 
2499,Yes that is one of my favorites too! Have you tried the impossible whopper at Burger King?
2499,No! Is it good?
2499,Good is kind of a strong statement but I'd say it definitely helps if you have a craving for a burger
2499,I'll have to try it the next time I am craving meat. 
2500,Yeah ok..I used to have a subcompact honda civic and I loved it! 
2500,i love the honda civic but i like the cr v more . that trunk space .
2500,Cargo space is important..I used to like to drive mine to the beach and go fo walks..Do you enjoy walking on the beach?
2500,i do. i love the sand. I love walking with my spouse
2500,"Thats awesome, I enjoy that as well. "
2500,"My kids love the sand too.My Honda, not so much..lol"
2500,Haha thats funny..I know what you mean..Sand has a way of getting around lol..
2500,yes it does.. lol..Big headache
2500,"Yeah i know right..Maybe Ill go today, who knows."
2500,Do that. You will be happy..Any plans for the weekend?
2500,"Happy is always nice lol! This weekend? Nah not much, whatever comes up i guess, how about you?."
2500,We have a Halloween party at a friends bar..Its always fun if no fights start..lol
2501,wow 700 million worldwide that is a huge success.
2501,I know..maybe i should try too lol
2501,not a bad idea if you have instruments at your disposal
2501,haha no i have no music skills. but an idea of making whooping 700 million 
2501,"making money is the ultimate plan, but what if you hire writers."
2501,yes thats not a bad idea at all
2501,most of them always have standby writers should incase of music droughts.
2501,yes plus would be a great social life too
2501,still can't believe they are getting paid to have fun
2501,ive seen alot of mucisians having a good social life..well making robots isnt bad too
2501,it isn't but what about the resources?
2501,i have enough resources for now
2502,Do you like the band Aqua?
2502,I sure do. I think they're pretty good. a 2000's band for sure!
2502,I agree! Barbie Girl is my favorite song. What's your favorite band or singer?
2502,"Connie Francis is my absolutely favorite. I also really like The Beach Boys, a band from 60s."
2502,I like the beach boys too. My mom played them and Elvis all the time.
2502,I'm kind of an old flower child- I love running around barefoot!
2502,"I love that! When I was young, we never wore shoes. I don't think my grandchildren have ever been outside barefoot!"
2502,Maybe it's a thing of the past?!
2502,"I think so, I hope not though. "
2502,I am a serious knitter- do you like to knit or sew?
2502,I just taught myself to knit last year! I'm knitting a blanket now for my mom. How long have you been knitting?
2502,It's been about 5 years now. I've learned so much since I first started.
2503,"No, I am a dancer and I would be afraid it would affect my performance."
2503,"What type of dancer? And, what did you do to stimulate your hair growth? I come from a poor family and have to use economical treatments for my hair."
2503,I like ballet the most but I have done other types as well.  I use cocunut oil so I am guessing that is why
2503,I've heard about that. I think it's also used as part of skin healing and radiation treatment
2503,"yes, it is great for skin and hair.  I didn't realize that marijuana help with hair growth"
2503,"It helps with many chronic conditions, too. It gives me enough relief to enjoy the world's natural beauty again :)"
2503,I would try it for pain but like I said I am afraid that it would affect my dancing
2503,"I can see the why you would feel that way. I would be worried too. I'd hate for it to get between me and my passions, also."
2503,What type of things do you enjoy doing
2503,"I like to capture the beauty of nature around me in photography, drawing and painting."
2503,Oh that is awesome!  I also enjoy photography.  Nature shots are the best
2503,"Yes, they are wonderful! I also sculpt. Do you have any other hobbies?"
2504,"I only saw the highlights, missed the main event."
2504,What did you see in the highlights?  I heard there may have been a big upset last night.
2504,"they just looked intense, I wasn't that interested honestly haha. I took my dog for a long walk instead"
2504,"I was actually out taking my horse for a ride when the fight was happening, so it looks like our animals kept both of us from watching."
2504,"I help my neighbor a lot, so I stopped by there with the dog as well. Gotta watch out for our elders!"
2504,That's definitely a good mindset to have.  I wish more people in the world had that kind of respect for the elderly.
2504,I certainly agree. I do all I can for those in need.
2504,Is there something in particular that you do to help your neighbor?
2504,"A lot. Cut the grass, help cook and clean, keep her company, anything I can do to make her comfortable."
2504,Well that was really nice of you to do. You sound like a great neighbor.
2504,Thank you! I think we all need to be nicer to one another!
2504,"The world definitely would be a better place if we all were.  So, are you planning to watch the next UFC match?"
2505,So far so good. Stock market is going well. I also collect vintage furniture. What do you do?
2505,I specialize in health and property with some investment on the side.
2505,Interesting. That's certainly a growing field. Do you have a family?
2505,"nope not yet . hope to settle down one day , but the business life has me now ."
2505,I understand. First things first. Are you a music lover by any chance? My favorites are the Beatles. Old school for sure.
2505,Yes! I'm  big fan myself. Wish I'd been around in the 60s for Beatlemania.
2505,"I was and it was cool. I remember watching them on the Ed Sullivan show, John was my favorite."
2505,That's cool.  They have so many great songs.  Hey Jude has always been one of my mothers favorite
2505,Love that one too. Any group around these days you like?
2505,"I mostly listen to classic rock and oldies, but I like Damien Rice"
2505,Not familiar with him but will look him up. Well the grandkids are here for dinner so I must go. Have a good evening!
2505,you as well ! have a good one !
2506,"Yes, but it is an important one"
2506,i actually did take piano lessons as a young child but never continued. what else do you play?
2506,Just the piano because it is the purest instrument
2506,what kind of music do you listen to?
2506,Mainly just classical music
2506,oh. i have a wide range of music that i listen to. pretty much everything except country
2506,I wouldn't know I just listen to classical music. That's cool though
2506,have you ever been to a concert?
2506,"No, I am not really interested in them"
2506,you should really try one. just to get the experience at least once. very fun
2506,"Maybe, if its someone I really like. "
2506,well who do you like?
2507,wow that is awesome
2507,I love movies. I'd love to be a director when I grow up.

2507,the nun 2
2507,Do you know who the director was?
2507,yes i do
2507,Who was it?
2507,corin hardy 
2507,"I haven't seen The Nun, either 1 or 2, but I love his work in The Hallow"
2508,why not? tennis is a lot of fun! I wish I had started playing it sooner
2508,I really never got into tennis although two of my close friends are avid. tennis players.
2508,that's cool! Have they participated in any competitions?
2508,"Not that I know of. But talking about tournaments, i enjoy watching the playoffs at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in NY on TV..."
2508,nice! do you watch it with friends or by yourself?
2508,Usually by myself. I love the action of tennis and particularly famous players like the Williams sisters and Maria Sharapova.
2508,"oh yes, those are awesome players! They started so young! I wish I had played tennis instead of football in high school"
2508,"I never played tennis but I played a lot of basketball. In fact, my High school  team played in a city basket ball league."
2508,"that is impressive, do you still play basketball nowadays?"
2508,I cannot. I had a heart attack when I was 42. Basketball is too strenous for me.
2508,I'm sorry to hear that. I also had a heart attack a few years ago while roofing
2508,I am still OK but have to watch my diet and exercise every day indoors but no more than walking or dancing.
2509,Definitely.  Do you have a significant other?
2509,"Yes, I have been married for 30 years"
2509,"Aw, that's so sweet.  Congratulations!  Have any good relationship tips?"
2509,"Thank you..I sure do, never go to bed angry "
2509,"That is some good advice, and one I try to follow.  Usually just makes it worse the next day."
2509,I am sure it does..I will agree
2509,What do you like to do together?
2509,We like to sit and talk about everything or do things with the kids
2509,That's cool.  Communication seems to be a great thing to have in any relationship.
2509,that's true . time is the most important thing we have.. So do you have any kids?
2509,"I don't but she does with her ex-husband.  I live with her and her 2 oldest, we all get along great. =)"
2509,Thats awesome and I wish you all the best

2510,Wow! That's going back awhile :)
2510,He never goes out of style
2510,"That is very true. I loved the movie, ""Walk the Line""."
2510,Yes!  great movie!  and joaquin phoenix did all his own singing i think
2511,That's sound intresting you enjoy math? Math has always been a tough subject for me.
2511,Not as it seems. You only need to adhere to the rules and stick with the principles.
2511,What career path are you interested in pursing?
2511,Systems Engineering and Computer Science.
2511,That's a very rewarding career have you always been interested in computer science and engineering?
2511,Yes basically. So how do you intend to overcome the fear of maths?
2511,By doing exactly what you said sticking to the rules and principles! thanks for the great advice.
2511,That's awesome. Mathematics is a part of our daily lives you know.
2511,"Yes, I Agree alot often I have to wish I paid more attention to instruction of math rather than giving up and getting fustrated "
2511,What career are you pursuing?
2511,Doctor-Medical
2511,What field of medicine did you study?

2512,"I definitely agree. I work at a dog shelter, and fall is definitely the best time of year to take the pups out for walks."
2512,"I have 2 kids, they'd love a dog but my wife is allergic. "
2512,That's a shame.  I think there may be non-allergenic breeds out there if that's something you ever want to look into.
2512,"I just might! I like dogs. But I'm a family man, so I gotta keep the wife happy!"
2512,"Oh I hear that, a happy wife is a happy life, right?"
2512,You bet! What do you do for work?
2512,"I work at a dog shelter, and I also perform in a local theater group.  How about you?"
2512,I'm a disc jockey at a local radio station. 
2512,"Sounds like an awesome job, is there a specific genre you mainly play?"
2512,"Yes, it's a top 40 station. I'm the morning guy!"
2512,"Very cool, I wonder if I've heard some of your stuff on my drive into work."
2513,Okay well dont wait too long!
2513,next year some time in may 2020.   What do you think ?
2513,I think that sounds perfect..It will be great there in may..
2513,I hope so. I'm pretty anxious about it.
2513,Ooh dont be anxious it will be fine..You will see..So how do you feel about the desert?
2513,My father was a truck driver and used to love to visit the desert.  Have you ever been?
2513,"Thats funny, my grandfather was a truck driver and I saw the desert for the first time with him..I love to camp there."
2513,Wow! My mom has fond memories.  Would love to take her on vacation there.
2513,"Ooh thats cool, I think you should do that defenitely...I plan to go after I finish my college degree."
2513,Sweet!  Do you have any plans for the summer 2020?  
2513,I can hopefully do some desert camping by then! If im not too busy working!
2513,I have always wanted to go camping.  I think it would be really fun!
2514,7th grade. I liked my art teacher that year. How about you?
2514,"anything but 5th grade, when I broke my nose!"
2514,That sounds awful! I'm sorry! I switched from glasses to contacts recently. Were you wearing glasses when your nose got broke?
2514,"yes, they broke too.  It was terrible!"
2514,"Wow! How terrible! Are you an indoors or outdoors kind of person? I stay in all summer, But I LOVE being outside in winter."
2514,Its so hot in the summer I just stay inside and read.  The fall is nice
2514,"Isn't it, though! Fall is my favorite! What's your fave book genre?"
2514,I like vampire and fantasy type books
2514,OMG! Me too! My all time best ever is Anne Rice's vampires.
2514,that was a good one.  Of course I am a big Twilight Fan as well.  
2514,"I liked those, too. Who's your favoe character?"
2514,edward.  How about you?
2515,happily and vigorous
2515,Vigorous sounds fun!
2515,yeah it was my cousin's wedding
2515,My wife things the only thing I do well is dance  LOL
2515,so you are a very good dancer?
2515,It really depends on your definition I guess 
2515,are you a paid dancer or you do it for the fun of it?
2515,Both really! Not pants-splitting good though 
2515,hahahaha are you mocking me
2515,Not at all!  I wish I could have seen it!
2515,hahaha too bad you can't 
2515,I can try to recreate it and take some photos perhaps?
2516,I really enjoy cutting through the water when doing the butterfly stroke. 
2516,"Swimming is really fun and besides it, it is very healthy as it involves all muscles of the body to be engaged in movement"
2516,"Watching the swimmers at the last Olympics was really something special, inspirational even!"
2516,I feel you. That sport is very majestic and can be considered any art form
2516,Do you have a preferred style of swimming?
2516,"In any sport, soccer, swimming, running,and gymnastics"
2516,Is swimming your favorite sport?
2516,yes i love swimming how about you?
2516,"Whilst I love swimming, my favorite sport is darts. I really appreciate the precision needed to win."
2516,Have you ever played yourself?
2516,"Only in bar teams, never professionally."
2517,I agree. Tom and Jerry is my favorite! What's yours?
2517,my favorite cartoon is spongebob squarepants
2517,I like that one too. I watch a lot of cartoons.
2517,me too. especially with my little brother. do you have a brother or sister?
2517,"No, I'm an only child. I spent a lot of time with imaginary friends!"
2517,i did too before i had a brother. what is your favorite part about school?
2517,Lunch is my favorite part of the day!  Science is my favorite class.
2517,i love science too! but lunch is pretty great. i also like reading.
2517,I love to read too. I read about 5 books a month.
2517,what are your favorite books or series?
2517,The Harry Potter books are my favorites. What are yours? 
2517,Those are my favorite too! My favorite book and movie from Harry Potter is the Half Blood Prince
2518,"Yes, I really do its a rewarding job to have. Kids bring joy! do you have any children of your own?"
2518,Yes I have 3 grown daughters and 6 grandkids
2518,Oh what a joy! I recently divorced I have 3 teens.
2518,Sorry to hear that but teens keep you on your toes for sure..lol
2518,"Oh yeah, They are giving me a run for my money. "
2518,It gets worse before it gets better..I had 3 girls so they always had drama..lol

2518,oh yeah! lol the boys isnt so bad its just the girl smart mouth lol.
2518,YES I know they can be..lol
2518,Oh yeah! do you have any hobbys?
2518,I love to bake and knit..What about you?
2518,Oh Fun! i love scrapbooking and baking.
2519,Yea my office is a bit far too. I sell insurance.
2519,What kind of insurance?
2519,I sell home and auto insurance for All State.
2519,Auto Insurance has to be a good business.  so many terrible drivers out there
2519,Yes especially out here in L.A. I do alright for myself. 
2519,LA traffic!  I drove in it once.  I couldn't do it every day
2519,Exactly why I let the wonderful public transportation take me wherever I need to go. What do you do by the way?
2519,I work in healthcare
2519,"Oh that's good, maybe I can sell you some insurance too? Just kidding."
2519,haha!  Only if it's not health insurance.  that mess gives me a headache
2519,Yea I hear you. My clients can barely stand me.
2519,Does home insurance in California cover damage from the wildfires? 
2520,"I think my friends and I will probably go to six flags, we love the roller coasters there.  Have you ever been?"
2520,"Yes, I have been to the one over Texas. I believe there was a Mr. Freeze ride I enjoy there."
2520,I'm from the midwest so I haven't been to that one yet.  If there are some great roller coaster thought I would consider making a trip!
2520,I think it would be worth the time. It is more adult oriented.
2520,That's definitely a plus.  When my friends and I go we definitely get stuck in long lines of kids.
2520,You should see Disney World. That is quite the line. I try to stick to disney movies.
2520,"Oh yeah, that's almost too much for me.  So, what do you do for work?"
2520,"I part-time on a competitive dance team, and part-time CSR. How about you?"
2520,That sounds like fun work!  I'm a track coach at a local high school that I used to run at.
2520,Good deal. It helps me stay in shape. I imagine it is the same for you.
2520,Oh for sure.  Fitness is a pretty big part of my life so it's great to have it as a part of my job.
2520,"Indeed, it is a new world we live in. Everyone is seeing we need to change. Change for the better."
2521,"Yes, I would look around my small apartment but never found the source of the footsteps."
2521,That is pretty creepy. I just got back from a long road trip and stayed at a motel I sore was haunted.
2521,"One time, I heard scratching noises above my room. It couldn't be in the attic because I lived in the attic."
2521,That sounds like squirrels or mice or something. Have you told your landlord?
2521,"You are right. But it took me a while to figure it out. One day, a neighbor told me that there was a hole on our roof."
2521,"Those critters are smart. And especially as it gets colder, they're looking for someplace warm! "
2521,I reported it to my landlord. It cost him $700 to repair the damage! I felt sorry for him.
2521,Sounds like you have a good landlord. Remember he can take that off his taxes. What else is going on?
2521,You know I have a pet skunk. It really freaks out my visitors. They're always afraid it will skunk smell!
2521,I would be too. How is it that it doesn't smell?
2521,"I took my pet to a vet who removed it's ability to spray its skunk smell, so now it is harmless. "
2521,Wow. They are really pretty animals actually. I just have a little dog. She's a dear. She watches UFC with me.
2522,And also proper skill and patience would help.
2522,It just takes practice. What kind of food do you like? I prefer vegan.
2522,"I eat all things. As far as it's healthy, delicious and good."
2522,Healthy and tasty are what matters! I miss a good steak at times though.
2522,LOL.. You can't be vegan and still miss steaksthat?
2522,I know some swear they don't. I also think those have never had a good steak either lol.
2522,Great.. How's the experience being a vegan?
2522,"it is different to get used to at first , but there are different options of food ."
2522,Great!
2522,There are many vegan festivals that have food and entertainment. And I remind myself its for the animals.
2522,bye
2522,Have a great day! Bye!
2523,I was walking to the bakery I run. I had a big meeting and showed up in soaking wet clothes.
2523,Sounds like you didn't have an umbrella.
2523,No i don't like umbrellas because they get caught in the wind
2523,Did you have some other clothes to change into?
2523,No i showed up to the big meeting at my bakery in wet clothes
2523,Did people notice you were drenched?
2523,Yes I walked in and there was a line of puddles behind me
2523,What was the meeting about?
2523,The meeting was about selling bagels to a grocery store
2523,Did you get through the meeting OK?
2523,Yes I did
2523,Did anyone give you a hard time about being wet?
2524,I like to go out on  my boat and go fishing
2524,"That can be fun, but I can't bring myself to put worms on the lines."
2524,I also use nets.
2524,Yes that would be easier. Do you also like to sail?
2524,No my boat has a moter
2524,"Oh, how about water skiing?"
2524,I don't do that. I live by the ocean and only go boating on the ocean where water skiing is hard
2524,Yes it would be hard. I love the ocean.
2524,Why do you love it
2524,"I love the sound of the waves, the way it looks at sunset and all the sea creatures"
2524,I like watching the sunset from my porch
2524,Paint me green with envy. But I have things around here to enjoy too
2525,How big are your cats?
2525,About 6 months old.. Furry!
2525,What kind of a cat are they?
2525,I don't have such knowledge about cats. I just love them for being sneaky animals!
2525,My cat is a Mancoon and he weighs about 28 pounds. Very furry and cuddly.
2525,I love furry animals!
2525,Me too. Did you have them declawed?
2525,Yes.. To avoid the scratches on myself and properties!
2525,"Yeah, their claws can do a large amount of damage."
2525,And can be bad for infections too. Then I love how they scare the rats away.
2525,I have a scratching pole for my cat and she loves it.
2525,Cool.. Do you have other domesticated pets?
2526,So do you grow any plants yourself?
2526,"I do, I have some herbs that I grow in my kitchen and backyard. What about you?"
2526,Yeah I actually have 2 acres on the countryside. my favorite thing to harvest though has to be carrots
2526,I didn't know that! What other plants do you have on those 2 acres?
2526,A little bit of everything. My peppers are another favorite. 
2526,What type of peppers? I had a caterpillar destroy my bell plants years ago.
2526,"yup, bell peppers! so what kind of herbs do you have?"
2526,"i have basil, rosemary, parsely and some others. Does anyone help you out on the 2 acres?"
2526,My husband does! Are herbs pretty easy to grow? That's something I have never tried actually.
2526,"Yeah, the rosemary takes care of it's self and needs no care. I would love to help you on the farm and give the country life a try. "
2526,It's really peaceful although it can be creepy at night sometimes
2526,haha I bet. What's the creepiest stuff that you have come across?
2527,"Yea magical it was, especially when we cheated!"
2527,"You mean you cheated to ""magically"" raise your grades?"
2527,"No he couldn't change my grades, he was a student too!"
2527,Well why cheat if you can't get better grades? Would you not be in trouble if you were caught?
2527,Of course I be in trouble with my husband! My mother never loved me so I look for love elsewhere I guess.
2527,"Oh, sorry! I thought you meant cheating as ""on tests."" You mean CHEATING."
2527,Yes we met in the classroom as students. My name is parrot so when I told him that it obviously grabbed his attention.
2527,I'll bet more than your name grabbed his attention. I see cheating all the time in my work.
2528,What genres do you like to watch?
2528,A lot of crime documentaries. I literally could watch them all day
2528,"I love crime documentaries so much. Podcasts, too!"
2528,I don't listen to many podcasts.  Just a few house music episodes a dj friend of mine does
2528,"Right on. If you like crime documentaries, you'd probably love them. I really enjoy listening to them on commutes and such."
2528,I'd love to check one out- any suggestions?
2528,"Generation Why, My Favorite Murder, and Crime Junkie are my favorites! Generation Why is probably the best one to start with"
2528,That's great to know.  I'm not working right now and have plenty of time on my hands  LOL
2528,Yes!!! Especially working on MTurk you'd definitely be able to listen!
2528,"Isn't the the truth?   You're pretty wise, friend"
2528,Hahah thank you. I usually watch crime docs or food docs during MTurk work when I can hha
2528,I'm a fiend for Chopped   hahaha
2528,"YES! I also love Chef's Table and Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat"
2529,Did you know that Queen Victoria is the second longest reigning UK monarch?
2529,I did know that but don't remember who the longest was
2529,"The current queen, Queen Elizabeth II."
2529,Oh duh. lol!  that one I should have known.
2529,Did you know that Queen Victoria was barely 5 feet tall? 
2529,I figured she was pretty short from her photos
2529,"I feel tall compared to her, and I'm only 5 7."
2529,I wish I was that tall.  I'm 4'11
2529,"Still, height isn't everything. She survived at least six assassination attempts. JFK was 6'22. Presents a larger target I suppose."
2529,I didn't know there was assasination attempts against the queen.
2529,"Queen Victoria was shot at a number of times, usually when in a carriage. I think the current queen has a far more relaxed life."
2529,probably.  I couldn't imagine the stress of royal life though
2530,They say that I am a great athlete and I have a future in baseball
2530,"That's awesome, what position do you play?"
2530,"short stop and pitcher, youmplay basseball?"
2530,"no, not really.  I watch some. "
2530,miami marlins want to sign me
2530,that's great. It does sound like you have a future in baseball. Good luck to you!
2530,"thank, what do you do??"
2530,"I'm an engineer, I commute an hour each way to work.  not as exciting as being a ball player"
2530,"I'm glad for you, I wish you luck."
2530,"thank you , i do hope you make it big as a ball player"
2530,yes I big leaguer
2530,What do you plan to buy first after signing a big contract?
2530,I will buy a house and help my family
2531,"I think so, I was so embarrassed!  "
2531,Don't worry. you'll get over it. 
2531,"I hope so.  I mean, it's a natural thing that happens, so I guess I should just move on and pretend it never happened."
2531,yes . you will be normal again  it is very natural.
2531,True.  It's probably because I changed my diet recently.
2531,wow ... why did you change?
2531,"I had to, my weight was getting out of control!  "
2531,sorry about that. hope you are working on it
2531,"I have been, I've lost 50 lbs on it so far."
2531,that is great i love your commitment
2531,"Thanks!  All I can do is keep going, even if it means passing gas at a meeting every now and then...lol"
2531,hahaha that would be embarrassing
2532,"Me either..I play guitar tho, wish i started when i was young like the five year old from yesterday!"
2532,"Yeah, same here. I went on to play sports instead. Musical instruments dates back to the beginning of human culture."
2532,Ok einstien..Do you like dogs? I have one that introduces me to women!
2533,Yeah different people have different cooking methods. I used to like cooking with wine by after AA I dont anymore.
2533,There are so many wonderful spices to use to make up for that
2533,Yeah I like spices. The time I was on jeopardy there was a whole category on spices
2533,There really is a great variety and variety in how their used. In Middle Eastern dishes cinnamin and allspice are often used with beef or lamb
2533,I like middle east dishes. What are your favorite ones?
2533,"I found a great Middle Eastern beef stew with green beans instead of carrots and potatoes, nice and spicy"
2533,Spicy food is the best
2533,"yeah, but it gives my heartburn if I eat too much"
2533,Yeah the happens to some people. Im lucky I cn eat alot of spicy food
2533,"You are lucky. I used to do a lot of baking when my children were young, that's fun too"
2533,"I like baked food, but like grilling food better"
2533,Grilling can be very versitile
2534,I like none of those?
2534,ever seen glee
2534,Nope.. Heard friends talk about it. Sounds like it's a musical series.
2534,yeah its pop music and jazz hands
2534,I may have come across it on tv but sadly not a fan.
2534,im not a fan either im a human 
2534,Lol.. That's funny!
2534,couldnt resist 
2534,Do you love RnB or Hiphop?
2534,i like pop its my favourite music whats yours ?
2534,Country rock!
2534,thats awesome i like to listen to country music when taking long walks on the beach
2535,I want to but I don't want to upset my roommate. I don't know what to do.
2535,You need to say something. It's just going to make you more and more angry. 
2535,You're right! I work in an office and I need peace and quiet when I get home. 
2535,i find that the best approach is sitting down and telling them calmly .
2536,I may try one day. I will stick to percussion for now.
2536,"It took me a while to learn how to play it. However, I also play the guitar. That was easier to learn."
2536,"Good deal. The only trumpet i partake in is while listening to Cake, the rock band."
2536,"So you play drums? I love the sound of drums like the bongo, tom tom and huge Japanese drums."
2536,Oh my yes. I rock a set of Pearls. 
2536,"Did you see the movie ""The man with a Golden Arm""? It was about a famous American drummer, Jimmy Krupa."
2536,"No, I will have to investigate it though. What kind of guitar do you have?"
2536,"6 string guitar. Before I learned to play it, I learned to play a 4-string ukelele. The chords are similar."
2536,That is awesome. If we find a poet to sing we could all join forces.
2536,"Well, I also love to sing. I sing Christian songs and other 1950's hits with my guitar."
2536,That is perfect. I can drop a beat for any scene.
2536,"Fantastic, we need to get together soon!"
2537,I can understand that.  When my mother was raising me in Russia she was a single mom as well.
2537,"oh that must have been very hard, but there is a lot to benefit from being a single child im guessing,"
2537,"Yeah, it just being the two of us helped with finances a lot.  Plus I was able to pick up some work when I was 16 doing some cooking."
2537,Did everyone else enjoy your new found passion for cooking?
2537,"I sure hope so!  It led me to a lifelong passion for cooking, and eventually to opening my own restaraunt."
2537,lucky you ! what kind of restaurant ?
2537,We specialize in traditional Russian cuisine.  It always helps to cook what you know!
2537,Which of the Russian cuisine do you like most. That is collection of the different cooking traditions of the Russian people.
2537,Potato dumplings are my absolute favorite.  It's what my mom used to make for me when I was sick as a kid.
2537,"Thats awesome! I really love french fries, its probably one of my favorite foods."
2537,I also can never say no to a good plate of fries.  It's one of my favorite American foods.
2537,There is nothing like a hot and crispy order if fries is there?
2538,"Wow, I can't believe it's been around that long. Do you do yoga too?"
2538,"I have never really done it, I have tried to meditate. I know it originated in ancient india though, and I know sort of what they do"
2538,"I like meditation, but have a hard time keeping engaged in longer sessions. I like that yoga is a full body experience."
2538,I  am a surgeon I don't really have time for meditation.
2538,Do you get time for any hobbies or vacations?
2538,Sometimes. They are few and far between
2538,I went on my first vacation in years this summer and it was such a nice escape.
2538,that's wonderful ! where did you go ?
2538,Italy!
2538,"Oh, I bet that was fun and interesting visiting another country too."
2538,It was great. I haven't been out of the country too many times. Have you gotten to travel much?
2538,About once a year. I take a about 2 weeks just because I don't get of work much if I don't
2539,"No, I think it might have been the wind"
2539,"Everything sounds more sinister at night, when the house is quiet"
2539,"It does, luckly Im 6 feet tall so I think more things are scared of me lol"

2541,I eventually want to work at a hospital or a clinic as a psychologist!
2541,"That's cool. I have worked in a hospital as a nurse before - hard work but rewarding.  Remember to take care of yourself, too"
2541,"For sure. The helping profession needs people who understand self-care, too. What do you do now?"
2541,I'm actually a medical researcher - I interact with medical staff daily!  I still need to work out for stress relief!
2541,"Wow, that is super cool. What degree do you have? I love working out, it helps me keep some of my sanity during my schooling."
2541,my degree was in Medicine.  My passion is riding my bike.  I love cycling.  What do you do when you work out?
2541,"I like to lift weights. I mostly identify as a powerlifter but also love going outside and spending time with my dogs/walking them, too."
2541,Yeah I used to love lifting weights but I am finding aerobics more fun.  Dogs are great although I have 2 cats. 
2541,My lungs are horrible so aerobic exercise is not super fun for me haha I've got 2 of each!
2541,Oh wow I'm sorry!  Do you smoke? I try to live healthy - I'm a vegan!  Do you eat meat?

2542,Who knows! I've never been tested. I love a good burger though. 
2542,Me too! I live in a condo so I eat in restaurants a lot- burgers are my fave thing to order. 
2542,I could use some burgers myself right now.
2542,"Me too I'm hungry! I live in the US, you?"
2542,Me too! How is your weather today. It still feels like summer here. 
2542,"It's a crisp fall day. I'd love to visit Canada, have you ever been? I haven't."
2542,I have been. It was beautiful. I hope to go again someday. I even joke about moving there in a few years. 
2542,"I've heard great things. Nice people, too!"
2542,Yes. Great sense of humor. Some of my favorite actors and shows are canadian. 
2542,Yes me too! I wonder if they are really that polite?
2542,The people were very nice when we were on vacation there years ago. 
2543,"That sounds lovely, whos your favorite country artist?"
2543,probably dolly parton shes pretty awesome
2543,"I'm not into country music if I'm being honest, what do you do in your spare time?"

2543,"I thoroughly enjoy collecting objects, I like collecting dragon ball z figures and rocks"

2544,"I love hiking in the woods, I wish I could hike the Appalachian trail some day.  "
2544,Do you live nearby to the trail?
2544,"No, I'm in Texas, we have lots of trails here though."
2544,I'm in the UK so spend most of the time walking moorland trails. The Appalachian is something special though!
2544,there's certainly some beautiful land in the UK from what I've seen.  
2544,Dartmoor is my favourite. We have some mountains but nothing like some of the American ranges. Scotland comes close though.
2544,"Ive been to the Rockies a bunch, and we have a few small hills in Texas.  "
2544,I'd like to go to the Rockies. I've been to Japan and walked on Miyajima. So many shrines on the mountain there!
2544,"That would be awesome, so many active volcanos in Japan.  "
2544,Have you walked on any volcanos?
2544,"no, I've been close to the one in Mexico City, but we didn't go up to the rim"
2545,I did. it was so embarrassing. I went to the manager after and complimented her how well she handled herself when I was rude and wrong
2545,That's awesome! I am truly impressed with your handling of the situation.. I have done the same before..I can relate
2545,"Yeah, it had been a long day. I cringe every time I think about it. "
2545,"It happens, so do you have any fun hobbies?  I love swimming, too cold now tho"
2545,I like learning new random things. I think I'm thinking about taking some blacksmith classes. What general area do you live in?
2545,I live in the Southeast..what about you?
2545,"Texas, I grew up in the Southeast. MIss it. "
2545,I love Texas. I have family in Dallas
2545,Nice! that's where I live. 
2545,Thats cool..How long have you lived there?
2545,12 years. It's this time of the year when I miss TN the most
2545,I know the feeling..I am from Va but been in WV now for 35 years
2546,I can barely walk straight most days  haha
2546,"Yes, but I like all sports. I really like triathlons since it combines multiples sports"
2546,Which one is your favorite?
2546,Probably biking
2546,Lots of cyclists where I live- More of a musician myself.  Or walking. 
2546,What part of being a musician appeals to you?
2546,"I just like getting caught up in the moment, and writing lyrics. "
2546,That's really awesome! What kind of lyrics do you write?
2546,Think.. rockabilly Radiohead   LOL
2546,oh thats cool. So are you in a band?
2546,Nope.  I taught myself how to play guitar in grade school and just love doing it.  Probably as much as you like biking I bet
2546,Oh I definitely love biking
2547,Me too. Do you have all the proper gear?
2547,"Yes, it's a must to hike in the snow"
2547,Winter is my favorite season. 
2547,Me too. I love to spend the evenings by a roaring fire with friends.
2547,That's a good one. I like drinking hot chocolate.
2547,"yes, with whipped cream!"
2547,What don't you like about the summer.
2547,It just get's so hot where I live you can hardly go out without burning up
2548,"Yeah, I prefer to know exactly where my food comes from if possible.  That's why I volunteer at a local urban farm."
2548,Well.. The whole idea of GMO was to make food sufficient to mankind! Are the fear true?
2548,I guess it's tough to say one way or the other.  I just like having a personal connection to what I eat.
2548,Same feeling here. I feared we might become paranoid of things we fear.
2548,"There's definitely a lot to be fearful of when it comes to food, it's such an important factor in someone's health."
2548,Absolutely true. Should that make everyone a farmer? Definitely not. Some would be too busy in that wise.
2548,"I hear that, it's not realistic for everyone to grow their own food.  I think there are ways to get involved in where your food comes from though."
2548,I would be interested to learn. Not like I don't care where my food comes from. i just want to downplay the fears.
2548,"Well, as someone who volunteers at an urban farm I can say we're always happy to have more people come out and check it out!"
2548,Are you a vegan?
2548,"Nope, I do eat plenty of veggies though.  Are you a practicing vegan?"
2548,Not at all but I have been trying to also stay healthy with my eating habit.
2549,"Yes, actually, I might be kind of interested in a relationship with him!"
2549,how did you two meet ?
2549,"We me tin college, but I dropped out. I'm a student again now though. "
2549,I'm glad you got back in touch then.
2549,"Yeah, he's pretty amazing. He's a doctor and I'm studying to be a radiologist. "
2549,That's important that you have common interests. I'm going to be a vet...similar but not the same. 
2549,Oh that's a great job. Are you in school now?
2549,"Still in school, yes. It feels like I have been in school forever. "
2549,"My name is Mary, by the way. You?"
2549,Jillian. Nice to meet you. 
2549,What do you like to do for fun?
2549,"Watch netflix, hang out with my family. You?"
2550,Yes I love taking care of my puppy. 
2550,That's amazing! I just got a new puppy 3 months ago.
2550,"Oh really, what kind?"
2550,He is a beagle terrier mix and full of energy. We love to go hiking together.
2550,maybe one day your puppy and mine can play together  or go hiking. 
2550,yes ! ! i'd absolutely love that . do you do anything else for fun ?
2550,"i dont have friends, so i only take my puppy out for walks"

2551,wow that is great... you must have won lots of trophies
2551,"Yeah, I used to have a ton but gave most of them away."
2551,thats is very kind of you
2551,Thank you. I kept the most important ones but gave some to friends and family if they wanted to have one.
2551,i can imagine how happy you made them
2551,Definitely. Do you have any family
2551,yes i do but a small one
2551,How small is small?
2552,"So, speaking of creatures, do you have any pets at home?"
2552,Maybe I do. I kept this one and named it Kitty the Kat.
2552,So you just have 1 cat?
2552,yep but I want another one soon.
2552,I love cats and want one or two eventually. For now I have a couple of pups
2552,I really wish I could own a unicorn!
2552,Yeah that would be cool. What color do you think unicorns really are?
2552,Rainbow and pink! They probably live in the pyramids too!
2552,"Rainbow for sure! But I think they live in the Amazon rainforest. That's where they're hiding, I'm sure."
2552,Why the Amazon?
2552,It's big and there are already some interesting creatures in there. Who knows what else there could be!
2552,I have heard The unicorn was depicted in ancient seals of the Indus Valley Civilization
2553,yeah and help is always around the corner
2553,Actually my twin brother and I are single. We get along well. We love our jobs.
2553,"yeah you should, you are siblings. what do you do?"
2553,We both love music. So we formed a band when we were in high school. We're still together playing music..
2553,if this isn't goals i don't know what is.
2553,We actually did not plan to be singing together for long. But here we are 10 years later and earning our living as a band.
2553,woow the motivations you guys give each other must be hella strong
2553,"Yep. We play gigs all over town. Sometimes, we have to turn them down because we get too busy,"
2553,"that is nice, have you thought about making records"
2553,We have actually made some hits but not that big. We need to write better songs. My brother is the composer of our group.e
2553,"ohh, so what genre of music do you do?"
2553,We like to play tunes of the 1950's to 1970's. Many of our audience are in their 50's  and 80's.
2553,well goodluck.
2554,its were you read the lines on the palms of hands my mom is a palm reader in new orleans

2554,that's insane and kind of scary.  I don't deal well with blood - and I'm a football player!
2554,not a good phobia for a football player but then no footballer wants to see red
2554,ha ha - true!  And I'm on the Ravens! what do you do?

2555,I am in Virginia Beach. I spend most of my time playing racquetball. Do you like any sports?
2555,I'm more of a putter-around-the-house person. I love my garden. 
2555,Yum. I love fresh food. What do you grow?
2555,"I have tomatoes, peas, corn, lettuce. Can make a nice salad!"
2555,"That's great! I wish more people would garden, so much healthier to grow your own food."
2555,"Yes! I have a real sweet tooth, dessert if my favourite. You?"
2555,"I prefer savory. A good pizza, or chicken parm is more my style. Of course I won't turn down a dessert. "
2555,I love pizza too! I love getting takeout on a cold Friday night. Where do you work?

2556,"If there is sport I like, that would probably be the one.  It's very exciting to watch"
2556,"It's a rough game, one I'd rather watch than play"
2556,"Do you ever watch live?  Or on television? I watch tv on the internet, exccpet I wish it were faster"
2556,Yes it's frustrating to watch on the internet when it starts running slow. We usually watch on TV
2556,"Ah, getting loud and yelling at the television?"
2556,"oh yeah, sounds like you have some experience with that"
2556,I'm from Detroit- Lots of frustration with the teams there   LOL
2556,Yes that's true. The Lions are often a disappointment. But you've had some good basketball and baseball teams over the years as well as college football
2556,"Yeah, for sure that. Sounds like you may be a fan then?"
2556,"Yes, I grew up in Ann Arbor"
2556,oh man!   I moved from there to Lawrence 10 years ago.  Small world.
2556,"That it is, I miss it now that I'm on the other side of the country"

2557,Thank you for your time!

2559,ohh that means i am lucky 
2559,haha!! you are i guess!!
2560,"Awesome, what position does he play?"
2560,He's a wide receiver. He's the best really. Hoping he gets a scholarship.
2560,Awesome! I was never a football player but I like to go for runs with my dog.
2560,I run with my dogs as well. Dogs in our family are often treated as family members. I know that I treat mine like a king
2560,"Awesome. My dog is very well loved. She is adorable, too."
2560,Ha Ha. They all are until they run.
2560,Yes... mine has started to chase me a lot which can be... interesting
2560,"speaking of chasing, my wife just lost her human resources job. she's gonna have to chase down a new one real soon."
2560,That's horrible to hear. Hopefully she will find something else quick.
2560,"I hope so, too. In the meantime, at least she doesn't have any big expenses."

2561,"Ooh I heard it was nice there too, beautiful country up there..I should go up there and write"
2561,You go for it!
2561,maybe I will soon..What do you do up there?
2561,I like to walk around downtown and explore nature
2561,"I bet that is nice, lots of senic views to see there and to explore as well..Do you like movies? I work as an extra."
2561,I like action movies and comedies mostly
2562,That is a long period of time.
2562,"Pretty much, it was also prevalent in Rome and in medieval times."
2562,That's amazing. Didn't know it was that long

2563,For sure! We used to go to the Checkerboard Lounge and listen to some awesome blues
2563,I haven't been out to hear live music in a long time.   I just listen at home a lot
2563,Sometimes music sounds better at home
2563,With a good meal and friends.
2563,Yes! Most anything is better with good food and good people
2563,"So are you still living in Chicago, or maybe going to school there?"
2563,No living in California now
2563,"Ah, the left coast.   I'm a huge fan of the Bay area-  I'm out at least twice a year. What part?"

2565,"I've never tried it, but I've seen it on Food Network. My friends have tried it before and like it. "
2565,When did you start cooking?
2565,"Actually just over the past couple years. I worked full time and my husband did most of the cooking, until a couple years ago. Now I do it all. "
2565,I cook all the time. I cook every meal I make.
2565,"I cook most nights, but I don't enjoy it. "
2565,Why?
2565,It takes too long. I would rather be reading or something.
2565,Aww I'm sorry. I always wanted to be a chef or run a restaurant but I don't feel comfortable about cooking for anyone.
2565,Maybe you have a budding chef on your hands.
2565,Maybe.

2566,"Probably not, my wife is a nurse so shes it always working and i am too"
2566,"That makes sense. But if you could have any pet, what would it be?"
2566,i would have to say dogs

2568,"oh, that's interesting.  how long have you been retired?"
2568,6 years ago. Which is both good and bad! Lucky I haven't suffered any recession effects.
2568,Yes.  My father retired and it's hard to get by on a fixed income. 
2568,I can agree.  It must be hard when you don't personally live in that income bracket to understand.
2568,"Yes indeed.  I am so busy working, but my family is important, so I try to understand where my father is coming from on this issue. "
2568,"i am glad that you are able to understand this kind of things, most children don't understand.."
2569,I'm in UK and there's been a terrible story here relating to a truck
2569,I am glad that I never followed my mothers advice on being a trucker! Whats the story?
2569,39 dead bodies found in a container that came off a ship.  Truck driver came to collect it and found them all dead 
2569,That IS terrible! I don't know how someone could do that to people!!
2569,yeah some form of trafficking presumably 
2569,Thats what I would think too. Its amazing and horrible what people will do to other people.
2569,The truck driver has been named in all the newspapers though it's not at all clear if he's guilty - very tough for him and his family 
2569,It seems like that they wouldnt need to reveal his identity. Especially if he had nothing to do with it.
2569,"yes I agree.  If he's innocent, his reputation is still destroyed "
2569,No kidding.  I would hate for that to happen to anyone else.
2569,Sorry to bring up such a gloomy topic but it's all over the news here.
2569,It
2570,Really? I feel like I could probably help people out with that.
2570,"Hello fellow worker! I could use the help, my wardrobe is basically black tees and jeans!"
2570,"Well, let's see. I work as a kindergarten teacher and we usually try to play with colors. Maybe you can do the same? Just match opposite color clothing."
2570,"I'll try that, thanks! I game a lot...do you?"
2570,"Sure, when I can between work and everything else. What do you play?"
2570,"Call Of Duty every now and again, but, silly as it sounds Plants VS Zombies is my favorite."
2570,"Oh okay, cool. I've played both before. I tend to go for more artsy games, like What Remains of Edith Finch and Firewatch."
2570,Oh those sound interesting! I need to stop gaming so much and workout a little because I'm overweight. But really healthy!
2570,"I hear you. I know a guy who used to be the same way. He just started walking, then jogging, added a little bit of weights later. Lost 250 pounds."
2570,I have TRX straps and an Apple Watch. Maybe I should just start out walking.
2570,Sure! A bit of resistance training with the TRX straps wouldn't hurt either if you're healthy enough to start either!
2570,I am. Just finding the time is hard.
2571,Cool Sam nice to meet you! Is that short for samantha? 
2571,Yes that's it. What's your name?
2571,"Mine is Mark.Its short for Mark lol! So I just really really like new gadgets, and so do my 5 crazy kids!"
2571,Haha! That is so cute!
2571,Haha glad it made you laugh Sam having fun and laughing is important i feel..So how are you today?
2571,I'm great how are you doing?
2571,Im good thanks for asking..Wish I had a glass of wine tho haha
2571,I love wine! What's your favorite kind?
2571,"Oh cool we have that in common too..I like all kinds, but my fave is pinot noir. And you?"
2571,"Not my favorite but I had a really good one the other day with some kind of fruit in it, I could have downed a gallon of the stuff."
2571,"Haha I hear you! Yeah real wine is an aquired taste, sometimes wish I never aquired it lol..Seriously tho that sounds awesome what you had.."
2571,It was really delicious! No regrets here.
2572,It does. I miss living on the mainland sometimes.
2572,"Yeah, but im sitting in a office all day it gets boring"
2572,I live on a huge island now and I spend most of my time fishing.
2572,Fishing is truly fun. We occasionally go with my friends too. Do you go frequently?
2572,Yes. Very frequently. I mostly catch catfish.
2572,Wow! Have you always fished as a hobby? 
2572,Not always. Where I grew up people would fish all the time for food or sport.
2572,Thats fun I most play video games during my free time
2572,I just catch fish to look at them and let them go. What games do you play?
2572,Video games.
2572,"Right, what kind of video games? I like first person shooters and strategy and arcade and puzzle games."
2572,fps and racing games obv lol
2573,I dont like the evil parts of The Lion King.
2573,I get that a lot but isn't that a real part of life? Every situation can have both evil and good in it.
2573,"That is very true, but I have set my mind to only think about the positive things in life."
2573,"That's reasonable. By the way, what do you do for living?"
2573,I am a teacher by day. You?
2573,I'm a waitress.
2573,What type of place do you waitress at? 
2573,It's a small family owned Italian restaurant. It's a little pricey but the food is very good and I can eat for free.
2573,Very nice! Small Italian restaurants are usually the best tasting.
2573,I know. but more importantly I love my boss. She is very kind and caring towards us. How do you like teaching?
2573,That is very cool.  It is important to have a good working relationship with your boss. I love it 3rd grade. Very rewarding
2573,Awsome. How long did you have to go to school to be a teacher?
2574,"That sounds amazing.  I work at a zoo so I see Pandas every day, but I would love the opportunity to see one in the wild."
2574,It really was amazing
2574,Did you see any other wildlife while you were in the forest?
2574,No only bc it was a protected area.
2574,"Ah, I see.  So, what do you do for work?"
2574,I teach English to Chinese kids over we cam
2574,That sounds like really fulfilling work.  What's the most challenging thing about teaching over camera?
2574,Issues with the internet.
2574,I imagine things like lag would be a factor.  Still it sounds like really rewarding work that you're doing!
2574,It really is. I have 4 don't gs so it's nice to stay home with them
2574,It's definitely nice to be able to work from your home.  There are definitely days when I wish I could just stay home and work in my pajamas.
2574,Pajamas are comfortable. No shame in that.
2575,yes i like rock
2575,My prefer is Rock but I can listen any kind Romantic or even  pop
2575,I like hip hop too
2575,"Yes hip-hop is great also, i like Bob Dylan very much, he was a singer, songwriter and a painter :D"
2575,Do you like any rapper?
2575,"no I do not, honestly i'm not a big hip hop fan, for me it all went downhill after RUN-DMC, Public Enemy, NWA, Eric B & Rakim , KRS-One"
2575,which instruments do you like most?
2575,"Piano, but I like video games even more."
2575,I like guitar 
2575,"those are nice as well , do you play video games ?"
2575,I like playing soccer
2575,"Oh that's cool! I can't play, I'm diabetic. "
2576,"it was great! it had onion and peppers, my favorite"
2576,that is delicious
2576,it was. so what do you like to do for fun?
2576,playing video games you?
2576,Anything to do with nature. I love biking especially.
2576,thats fun are you a vegan?
2576,i am not but i have considered it. are you?
2576,nope.. am not too.. i love meat
2576,i do but i have some health issues that could probably subside a little if i ate a vegan diet
2576,yeah you need to eat healthy
2576,it's hard when so many yummy fast food places exist! do you have any favorites?
2576,yeah i totally agree with you
2577,"It was somewhat spice, but it was delicious. What is your favorite Mexican dish?"
2577,there is a new Mexican restaurant near me and I've been trying their menu
2577,"Awesome, I should tell my parents to try more Mexican food"
2577,where do they live? 
2577,"They live in Michigan, what about yours?"
2577,here in London 
2577,"Amazing, I wish I could travel there, but my salary at McDonalds does not allow that"
2577,it's expensive to travel.  I went to Dublin this summer 
2577,Thats awesome to hear! I bet it was beautiful
2577,Yes had a city break and did tourism.  Stayed in very cool hotel.  Did you get a holiday?
2577,"I did, I went to California to visit family"
2577,I have family in San Diego but never been to see them 
2578,That's right. Are you into cars?
2578,Yes.   The Honda Insight is a hybrid electric vehicle that I really like!
2578,Are they fun to drive?
2578,Yeah they're great. Super light and rigid.  They feel kind of springy when you ride them
2578,Are you an environmentalist?
2578,Yes because I like to save material and help lower greenhouse gas emissions.
2578,That's great. I got into it when I started my psychology degree
2578,Oh okay. I bet psychology was an interesting course.
2578,"It was, a lot of fun finding out how people think"
2578,i bet . so do you want to teach or do research ?
2578,Research. I get nervous speaking in front of others
2578,I feel you.I am that way to.I fear public speaking.
2579,I sometimes even dye my red hair in shades of the rainbow just to start conversations about this.
2579,Isn't it crazy how depending on our genes we might see each color a little different from one another.
2579,I've thought about that lots! How maybe the red I see is not the red you see.
2579,that is true. maybe it has something to do with color mixing the and the visual effects of a specific color combination.
2579,I suppose there is some way to scientifically prove that we all see colors the same.
2579,"There must be some way. I know that there are these curtains I sewed for my bedroom. They are clearly purple, but my husband thought they were brown. "
2579,"I've read that women have 3 ""color receptors"" and men only have 2 maybe thats why"
2579,"i've not thought about it much , but it seems likely ."
2579,Thats also why men are more likely to be color blind. We need at least 2 to see color.
2579,i never thought about it like that . i love your perspective !
2579,Well thanks! that makes me feel good!
2579,You are welcome. You learn something new everyday.  
2580,"Well, that sounds good.  I am in a band, but I've never done court reporting. "
2580,"yes , it is . i quite enjoy it . what type of band?"
2580,It's a rock band.  We play classic rock and other cover songs.   What types of crime do you cover?
2580,crime scene coverage mostly
2580,That must be very interesting.  I like to watch true crime shows like Dateline and Forensic Files. 
2580,"Yea exactly, I really like the ones with big time detectives and private investigators like Sherlock Holmes."
2580,"There are so many to see right now, but it's really become an obsession for me.  "
2580,well it is a good obsession becauae There is always new information and different perspectives.
2580,"Yes.  I quite agree.  If I wasn't so busy with my band, I would probably watch true crime shows all day long. "
2580,"that's cool . i could never be in a band , no one would come watch"
2580,"Well, you never know. It seems like there's always fans for every band. "
2580,Of course.but i am really terrible at singing Good luck with the music career. I'm rooting for you
2581,"It was very rewarding, but I should have been on a trip. I travel a lot."
2581,I also love traveling. It gives me a better idea about the world we are all living in.
2581,I agree 100 percent. It is a whole new perspective on life. Also as I am still in college I need the perspective. 
2581,"Yeah, right? I always have this dream of travelling to other places and help lower income kids with their education."
2581,"That is very, very cool. I kind of thrive for the same thing. Getting a nursing degree so I can travel and help the sick."
2581,That amazing. Have you heard about the difficulties that some little girls have even getting through middle school. I think at the time the world is a very unfair place.
2581,"I have heard. Personally I think these kids need to put down the phones, and be real friends to one another."
2581,"Yes, we need to start teaching about this from a young age in schools."
2581,"I agree, we should. Our world is a better place when everyone is getting along."
2581,"Absolutely, there are more education policies and curriculum featuring this now but it is still not enough."
2581,Never will be. These kids are so hooked on social media and what everyone else does. They can hardly think for themselves. 
2581,"That's true. Anyway, how much more until you graduate?"
2582,I love driving but I do have a Ferrari.
2582,"i have many cars , but not a ferrari ."
2582,There amazing!! I won a lottery so I'm loving life
2582,Maybe you'll hit the lottery one day!
2582,I did already. I also just bought a mansion. Not to brag!
2582,I love pasta and to swim. do you have a pool
2582,"Yep, just had an in ground pool put in this summer. What's your favorite pasta dish?"
2582,Steak and potatoes aremy favorite. But I make the best spaghetti. Never even had a lesson
2582,Spaghetti is the best. 
2582,I was super into G Love and Special Sauce back in the day.
2582,what's that. lol]
2582,it means the fun in spanish duh
2583,Very cool.  I feel like a Porsche is a bit too showy of a car for me.
2583,"I still want one though, they are very well made cars..Do you like to look at the stars?"
2583,"Oh definitely, I'm pretty reserved so having time outside to myself at night is something I really enjoy.  I take it you like the stars too?"
2583,Yes..Sometimes I lay awake at night just so I can watch them..I bet before TVs and computers were invented people did that alot.
2583,"I'm sure that was the case.  I think that's how a lot of constellations came to be, people making stories in what they saw in the sky."
2583,Oh thats an interesting idea! I never thought of it that way thank you for that! 
2583,Yup!  Are you interested in music at all?
2583,Sure I love music..Ive been playing guitar for a while now I love it! What kind of mucic do you enjoy?
2583,"I love to sing.  I have some social anxiety, and I feel like singing helps me get through a lot of issues."
2583,Thats good creative expression helps alot i bet!
2583,For sure. What type of guitar do you play?
2583,Oh any kind with strings haha! I own a gibson flying V now im playing mostly..What styles do you like to sing?
2584,That's true but I leave for college in three months.
2584,"I understand, you will absolutely miss home but college is very exciting!"
2584,That sounds right! And I make good money as a stocker so I can afford to have a good time
2584,"Sounds like you're set up for success. You should be proud, many do not have that opportunity to work and goto school"
2584,"Yeah, it's hard work though. Long shifts. Do you work?"
2584,"I used to, I recently had a child so Im staying home. I used to work as a Operating Room cleaner"
2584,"Wow, that seems like an even tougher job! How old is your child?"
2584,"It was tough, I was the only one working at night. No help either! My son is almost 1"
2584,Oh wow is his birthday coming up any time soon?
2584,"Yes, 2 weeks from today actually! Do you have children?"
2584,"No I don't, tell your son a happy birthday for me!"
2584,"Thank you I will, though he won't know what ""from an internet stranger"" means yet, but he will eventually"
2585,I like driving SUV's
2585,"If you can drive an SUV, you can probably handle a truck."
2585,"Really, I like driving sedan cars too "
2585,What is your favorite class of vehicle to drive?
2585,Mercedes benz c classs
2585,Wonderful choice. Those are very dependable and fun to drive.

2585,Did you drive any toyota vehicle 2019 model?
2585,"No, I have a 2012 Toyota."
2585,what other models did you like most?
2585,I once had a Chevrolet until my brother wrecked it while ignoring a stop sign.
2586,they are everywhere are seem to multiply
2586,For sure when i leave fruit on the counter while I'm at class all day.
2586,i left a banana out for 10 seconds once and it was game over
2586,one cool thing is to make your own fly trap
2586,how would you do that?
2586,Put some fruit in a cup. Place plastic wrap on top and poke tiny holes in it.
2586,that is absolutely genius. I heard you can use dish soap and water too
2586,How would you do that? spray it on them?
2586,no i was told to leave some in a cup and they go in but cant get out
2586,OH! That does sound like a good idea! I'll have to try that!
2586,i am willing to try anything to get rid of or limit the problem. especially in summer
2586,One of the only bad things about summer!
2587,Did he?  Which war? 
2587,"Mainly about the great wars, he loved all the political details about how they started"
2587,yes I can see that.  My grandfather served in the easter uprising in Ireland and I've enjoyed reading up on it 
2587,there was a war du to the conflict between the united states and united kingdom
2587,which war was that? 
2587,"i cannot remember but it was back during simpler times, way after the Independence war"
2587,how are you with Trump? 
2587,"i am not fan of trump , never was . what about you ?"
2587,Am in UK so safe distance.  Can't bear him.  
2587,Are your political views to the left or right?
2587,Left - and you? 
2587,"Oh, no. I am far left. I am a proponent of women's rights and civil rights in general."
2588,"I don't have a family to turn to, I was an orphan raised in foster care"
2588,O I am sorry to hear that.
2588,"it's ok, I have some friends who can help me find a place I hope"
2588,That's always a good thing. What is your favorite drink?
2588,I don't drink alcohol so I have to say a Coca Cola. Yours?
2588,I love sweet tea
2588,Do you make your own tea?
2588,"i do, and it is very nice!"
2588,sounds delicious. Do you like cooking?
2588,I love cooking. Thinking about becoming a chef. I love the way food brings people together.
2588,Are you going to school to learn how to be a chef?
2588,Yep! This will be my first year in school
2589,No. My roommate does a little. He went to Oktoberfest last year. I didn't go. I hate beer. 
2589,I love beer and also went to Oktoberfest last year.
2589,Wow. Maybe you met. Probably not though. I hear it's very crowded. 
2589,"It was definitely packed, I wouldn't remember anyone that I had seen there."
2589,Too much to drink?
2589,"I didn't drink too much, just a couple German beers.. just so many people there to remember specific faces"
2589,Right. Looks fun though. If you like beer. 
2589,"Yeah, not as much fun if you don't drink beer.. do you like any alcohol?"
2589,Yeah. I like wine okay. 
2589,"Can't say that I like wine, it gives me headaches. I'd rather drink beer or Rum"
2589,That's too bad. 
2589,"Headaches can be bad, yea.  Not a fan of pain in the head or neck."
2590,have you had McDonald's new XL burger with grilled onions?
2590,"No, that must be an international hamburger. What region is it from? I might have to go and try it."
2590,Italy I think.
2590,"Okay, cool. Do they have any other sort of specialized menu items?"
2590,Spumoni I think. Definitely going to get some as a reward for being done with my loans... whew!
2590,"My student loan debt is huge, too. Hopefully someone will come along and pay it off for me."
2590,I hope!
2590,"So, do you watch any comedy movies?"
2590,I like Mr. Bean. Do you enjoy comedy?
2590,"I love comedy movies. Especially stuff like Caddyshack, The Naked Gun, and even the newer stuff like Booksmart."

2591,"I have four dogs, so a Yukon would be perfect for me!"
2591,I do not even have a dog
2591,Really? They are the best! You should get one!
2591,"I thought about it, but dont think I could handle one. Do you like yours?"
2591,I do! I have mini greyhounds. They are so sweet. Do you have cats?
2591,"yes , i've 4 cats and they are so adorable"
2591,Cats are fun too! But I still prefer dogs. 
2591,i really like dogs better anyway
2591,Do you dress up the cats for Halloween?
2591,"no , i would never do that"
2591,Haha! My dog has a ghost costume!
2591,"that's so cool , i'd love to see it"
2592,It was going after my dog Allie. Shes a cool dog. Probably one of my best friends.
2592,That's cute. I love the cute names people give their pets.
2592,LOL. Do you have any pets? Or any hobbies you like doing?
2592,"Not right now. I've been thinking about it but with me working and studying at the same time, I'm worried I couldn't take good care of it."
2592,"That is good that you are thinking ahead like that. I cant take my dog to work, wish I cold"
2592,I feel you. Have you ever discussed that with you employer?
2592,"No. But I like to ride my bike to work, its red. So I probably couldnt take her anyway."
2592,Cool. It's good that you can bike to work. I usually have to carry a lot of client files back and fort so I have to drive to work.
2592,I wouldnt mind driving to work some days. But I do like the savings in gas cost.
2592,Yes that is definitely a plus!
2592,How far is it for you to drive to work every day?
2592,about 40 minutes on transit or 20 minutes by car .
2593,I really enjoy running in marathons
2593,"I do as well, how long does it take you to do it?"
2593,I am very slow.  I have been working to improve my times each year.  How about you?
2593,"i do marathons twice a year , but in america , mostly ."
2593,Have you run in the Boston Marathon?
2593,"I did, but not officially, and it was a trail running marathon(16 miles), how about you?"
2593,"No, I never have.  I have always wanted to, but it would be a very long trip to go, and I can't take the time off."
2593,where would you want to go ?
2593,"To the Boston Marathon.  But, I'd really be happy for a trip almost anywhere.  How about you?"
2593,I would visit the headquarters of the United Nations.
2593,"Oh, where is that located?"
2593,I am not sure where it is located
2593,What makes you want to go there then?
2594,"Wow, did they do to the hospital?"
2594,I hope he is alright now
2594,"I am not sure, as my buddies' family drove him away. I need to find him."
2594,Surely they just took him to the closest hospital.
2594,I need to go to the nearest hospital and check.
2594,Is there anything I can do to help?
2594,"If you want, you can help by making a few phone calls. I will phone St. Mary Hospital now."
2594,Ok. I'll call Mercy
2594,Thanks for your help. He is at St. Mary's. I am leaving now. Goodbye.
2594,Glad to help
2594,Thanks.
2594,I hope he recovers fine.
2595,"Yeah, but not too bad. It was my wife's birthday."
2595,Nice. Did you do it as a surprise at all?
2595,"I tried to, but I think she knew ahead of time."
2595,"Well, there you go.  She enjoyed it and if she didn't complain or scoff at you, then she sounds like a keeper!"
2595,"Oh for sure! She's a hairdresser as well, so free haircuts!"
2595,Nice! How often do you get haircuts?
2595,I try to get them once every two months.
2595,That's very convenient.
2595,I'd say so. What about you? How often do you get haircuts?
2595,"I try to wait as long as I can. If my hair is getting in my eyes while I'm exercising for football, then it's got to go."
2595,That's fair. I try and play basketball and I hate when my hair gets in my face.
2595,"Basketball is so good for exercise, and it has a limited amount of contact as well which makes it safer than some other sports. Like football!"
2596,They allowed pets so I brought my two cats with me. Read them campfire stories every night.
2596,That sounds fun. I had gone their with my two sons. We did a lot of hiking.
2596,"Oh I don't like hiking by myself, it's good you had company!"
2596,"In fact instead of hiking,  I would have loved to do some horse riding on those trails especially the ones near the buffs t"
2596,"Oh wow, have you ever seen a real horse?"
2596,"Oh sure, as a matter of fact i own one beautiful white miniature "
2596,"Oh wow, do you think your horse would like my cats?"
2596,"i am sure he will, he is a very friendly. Maybe he will take your cat for a ride"
2596,That would be amazing. My cats love being read to but I've never seen them try to ride anything bigger than themselves
2596,"Looks like you have an intellectual cat, my neighbor's just likes to laze around the house"
2596,"They are very smart, do you have any other pets?"
2596,"oh yes, I have also have a two year old golden retriever and a couple of ducks."
2597,That is so cool. I am jealous. What do you do for a living?
2597,Im into the entertainment business I guess you can say.
2597,That sounds fun. You probably traveling most of the time. What do you do for a leisure? 
2597,"Mainly Youtube, I do some freelance work on it occasionally, and Reddit. Lots of Reddit."
2597,"I am into building computers as a hobby,  that is why I do IT work sometimes. "
2597,"I see! Do you work on mainly PC games, console games, or both?"
2597,Both. I am really good at it. By the way do you like to listen to the music?  What band is your favorite? 
2598,Yes he has a hard time getting around the house
2598,Did you try taken him to a specialist to help with that?
2598,I did. they said she has rheumatoid arthritis
2598,I am sorry to hear that.. is there any physical therapy that can help her?
2598,Sorry I meant he. Just some pills and change in diet. Hes a proud man so stubborn
2598,"hahaha i know right, men and their masculinity."
2598,tell me about it. i was hoping to get a private nurse for him
2598,if i must say That's a bright idea.
2598,i am inclined to agree with you. makes life easy
2598,"yea i bet it does, then you can always spend your work free time with him normally"
2598,I could but i think he prefers to spend time alone.
2598,I understand although everyone needs some alone time too.
2599,Why Clint Baker of all people?
2599,He is very talented and pleasant to the ear. Who is your favorite?
2599,"I have so many favorites.  If I had to pick one, I'd go with John Coltrane"
2599,"GREAT choice! He would have made a great actor on my favorite show, CSI."
2599,"Ha.  I am partial, I suppose.  I play the saxophone too."
2599,I wish I could play instruments!  I am talented in the musical genre at all.
2599,I have been playing since grade school.  What do you do for a living?
2599,"Cool! I am in finance, which allows me to travel. I got to swim with manta rays on my last trip!"
2599,That sounds very exciting.  The closest I've been to anything like that is the shrimp I had for lunch.
2599,That's funny! What's your favorite food?
2599,Shrimp is certainly one of my favorites.  I like lobster too.
2599,I do not like any seafood. I love pizza!
2600,Was thinking of visiting Bangkok! have you been abroad?
2600,I visited Israel for a month about eight years ago.
2600,"Wow, how interesting! My wife and I were thinking of taking time away from the office to travel next year"
2600,Are you planning to take your kids?
2600,"Yes I am, I'd like my son to be exposed to all different kinds of wildlife, I've trained some animals in my life"
2600,What are his favorite animals?
2600,"Goats, cats, snakes, lizards and the most unique, hippo's. Do you have any favourites?"
2600,"I like elephants, pandas, and dolphins. Those animals all live near where you are going! If you see any, please send back some photos for me."
2600,"I absolutely will. I see you like animals with higher intelligence, not sure if pandas fit that. But they are cuddly!"
2600,Pandas are not cuddly. They are actually quite dangerous in the wild.
2600,"Oh I didn't know that! Fluffy but vicious, I'll make sure to avoid them if I ever see them"
2600,Asian elephants work with people though. The African ones are wild and too dangerous but the Asian ones can be trained for farm work and transport.
2601,I love running. My favorite is track.
2601,why is that your favorite
2601,I like the camaraderie with the team. I swim a lot too. Do you swim?
2601,I love swimming. now to me that is a very stress relieving activity
2601,It is! It's very peaceful. What other sports do you play?
2601,i play soccer. i like to run and its fun
2601,The competitive aspect is attractive too. Do you watch pro soccer?
2601,i watch womens pro soccer. i feel its more fast paced
2601,Good to support the ladies. I feel like they don't get enough attention.
2601,they dont. its much more entertaining and they win more
2601,Some of the girls from the USA team are really talented!
2601,they are but so are the ones from around the world. do you play?
2602,It was about the winter weather and his problem not being able to clean his drive way.
2602,That's terrible. I wonder how he's going to sort it out.
2602,He could have asked me to help him. I love snow and shoveling snow is a lovely workout for me.
2602,We don't get much snow here and I like it that way. How's your day been so far?
2602,It was alright I guess. I had to take my car for a small repair. It's a 2011 VW Passat.
2602,"I've wanted to change to a Jetta, which is a smaller VW family car, but haven't yet. I've been busy training kids who want to be professional bowlers."
2602,I never drove a Jetta but have heard many good things about it.
2602,It's my favorite. It takes a little getting used too though but no issues at all even in this very cold weather.
2602,That's cool. I might start looking for a new car to buy. I've been spending much more on repairs recently.
2602,Do a lot of research to ensure you aren't buying a bad car . Good luck!
2602,I'm considering between a Toyota or a Mazda SUV.
2602,Either of those choices sounds good. Enjoy the fruits of your labor!
2603,"All the other participants have formal training, and I don't. "
2603,Sometimes formal training takes a backseat to hands-on training
2603,You're right. Maybe i'm more prepared than I thought!
2603,I think you'll do just fine.
2603,Thank you! Have you ever done volunteering?
2603,I actually have in the past. I should try it again.
2603,"That's cool, what sort of volunteering?"
2603,At a Senior center. I drove their bus and helped out in some of their activities.
2603,Oh wow! That's so nice of you. What motivated you to start doing that?
2603,My Grandma was a member.
2603,"That's sweet. Do you think you would do it again, or try a different type of volunteering?"
2603,I probably will do something different. I got tired of yelling out Bingo numbers
2604,That is interesting. Did Al Gore take credit for the internet?
2604,"Yes, and he's been mocked for it ever since"
2604,Well the internet sure has changed the way people communicate.
2604,"I completly agree with that, we rely so heavily on the internet nowadays."
2604,It sure makes knowing what is happening in the world easy.
2604,"I know, it's seriously so crazy the way that the internet has evolved and how everything IS on the internet now."
2604,Some people seem to have a problem remembering that once you put something on the internet it is always there.
2604,"Yes, no doubt about that! I do worry about privacy issues!"
2604,I worry about friends who don't think before they type and create a firestorm with their opinions.
2604,I know and people seem to comb through posts to find these things about people
2604,And no matter how sincere the apology there is no forgiveness -- ever!
2604,Absolutely. Things have gotten so crazy that's it's almost pointless to engage others in objective discussion.
2605,I have cats. They bring me joy. 
2605,"i personally love chickens, but cats are great"
2605,I would love to have chickens. We aren't allowed to have them where I live. 
2605,"thats a shame , i'm from kansas where are you from ?"
2605,I'm from Florida. 
2605,"i love florida , ive visited many times"
2605,"It's great being to close to the beaches and theme parks, but way too hot. I may move someday. "
2605,you should come to kansas
2605,I think I would be bored. What do you have to do there? I love the ocean. 
2605,"hmm yes its a bit boring , but it is pretty"
2605,"How is the weather. That's the only thing I don't like about where I live. Otherwise, I'm very happy. "
2605,"today its a bit chilly , im really feeling the season"
2606,I love trips also
2606,Yes! me and my buddy go camping every year when it cools off.

2606,That sounds like a lot of fun! Which mountains?
2606,The appalachian mountains are my favorite. what are your favorite
2606,The smokey mountains
2606,Wow I have been there once in my life.
2606,Nice. When was that?
2606,When I was younger
2606,I donated some money to a charity there to protect the nature.
2606,Wow that is great!! Go earth!
2606,yeah. I believe any small amount of money matters.
2607,yeah i think so too.  I mean I graduated in 86 and I don't feel like I complain that much.
2607,Did she give any examples when she made that comment?
2607,"No, just a general comment she made after scrolling her social media account."
2607,"It must have been either Facebook or Twitter, haha. People love to complain on those platforms. "
2607,"yeah, not just people who graduated in the 80's lol.  "
2607,"Exactly! If anything, I'd say we are the more accepting generation."
2607,"Yeah, THe obly time i ever really complained to her was when she made me take piano lessons.  "
2607,I have one of those Casio keyboards but I don't have enough patience to learn how to properly play it.
2607,Thanks to all of those hours of practice I could probably make that keyboard rock.
2607,"Probably better than I can, that's for sure, haha! What was the first tune you learned to play on it?"
2607,chopsticks! 
2607,"I'll be honest, I don't know that one. Then again, I'm not the best when it comes to music knowledge. "
2608,Really? I wasn't aware of that.
2608,"Tattos are usually symbolic, or decorative or pictorial"
2608,Ah. I have a rose on my ankle. Which would that fall under?
2608,Depends what it means to you I would guess! I don't have any tattoos but am planning on getting one pretty soon.
2608,What are you thinking about getting?
2608,My two friends and I are going to get outlines of our pet cats together!
2608,So that would be a symbolic one then?
2608,"Yes! Especially since it has a double meaning for us, as it represents our pets that we love but it also represents our friendship."
2608,Thats so neat! My rose was in memory of my Grandma.
2608,"Oh wow! So, that makes it symbolic I guess. That's really sweet of you."
2608,She loved tending her roses!
2608,That's really sweet. Do you plan on getting any other tattoos?
2609,"That's right after they walked over the land bridge from Asia, right?"
2609,to be honest i am not sure. i have not been there as of yet
2609,I haven't either. Have you traveled much?
2609,i have. i would like to go to europe and visit more
2609,Have you been to Europe before? I would love to go to Iceland. 
2609,no i havent. all my travelling was the us and mexico
2609,That's awesome. I would love to go to Seattle one day
2609,what would you want to do there?
2609,I would like to go to the market where they throw the fish
2609,that sounds amazing. i think thats where they have the good coffee too
2609,"I hear they do, even though they are famous for Starbucks I hear they have better coffee"
2609,Yea i believe its called seattles best but dont quote me on that. 
2610,I do I feel awful. 
2610,"Well, what do you think you should do now?"
2610,I plan on writing about it on my social media pages though but only where I'm anonymous.
2610,Did you eat it all or did you save the candy?
2610,You know I haven't even touched it yet. I'm saving it for when I go rock climbing tomorrow.
2610,"My husband and I were just now talking, and we think you should return it."
2610,"Nah, I think I'm going to keep it since I didn't get caught. It's just a candy bar."
2610,You remember I have a Masters in Business and one of my courses was in Ethics.
2610,I do. You went to school to get a Masters in Business and I went to get a Bachelors in Creative Writing so that I could become a writer.
2610,"Ethics is doing unto others as you would have others do unto you. So give the candy back with a nice sincere apology. You will feel better, my friend."
2610,I knew you would bring Ethics into this haha. You're write though. It's best to do the right thing. I will return the candy bar and apologize.
2610,"Thanks, friend. I love you. Goodbye"
2611,"Yes! This is the first city I've ever lived in, and the nightlife is really bustling!"
2611,Another thing I love about the city is how culturally diverse it is! As many as 800 languages are spoken in the city!
2611,"I had no idea! But that's not terribly surprising, it is NYC after all."
2611,I know!  It is such a  linguistically diverse place!  It's amazing!
2611,"Definitely, the diversity is something to celebrate! What brings you to New York?"
2611,"I wanted something different. When I turned 20 last year I move out here with my sister. We share a small apartment, and I love it. "
2611,Well it is certainly different! Most of the apartments here are quite tiny. Do you have enough space?
2611,Just enough! 
2611,I understand! What are your favorite activites here?
2611,Love the restaurants. So many choices. 
2611,Yes! So much unique food. Every venue has a different atmosphere!
2611,I wish I had enough time to try them all. What is your favorite?
2612,"Actually, I've be doing ballet all my life."
2612,i remember as a child i dreamed of being an architec
2612,Cool. My mom was my first ballet teacher.
2612,"that is sweet , do you have fond memories of your childhood?"
2612,Absolutely. Did you do anything towards your dream of being an architec?
2612,"no , i never got to finish school . do you have other hobbies?"
2612,That's unfortunate. I like to read books. How about you?
2612,"i love books , specially about ghost , i find the topic fascinating"
2612,Cool. But I mostly prefer biographies.
2612,any recommendations on a good biography?
2612,I certainly suggest Elon Musk and Steve Jobs biographies.
2612,i will look into these
2613,when was the last time you was on a plane?
2613,Depends on what you mean. My last professional flight was 5 years ago.
2613,oh...you are a pilot?
2613,Yes! I flew commercial airlines for 15 years.
2613,ah...you ever fly to Buffalo? I'm a huge Bills fan.
2613,I don't remember all the places I flew into. I'm sure I did.
2613,yeah...I guess after 15 years you been a few places. I'm hoping I can get to Spain to study next year
2613,"I love Spain! I didn't often have a lot of time there, but when I did I loved to tour the different towns I was in."
2613,well I better get going...my family has seasons tickets to see the Bills so we're planning a trip to buffalo this weekend
2613,I hope you enjoy it! Think they'll win this game?
2613,Of course...would a true fan expect them to lose?
2613,"No! I mean, its a tough weekend for them. I think they can pull off a W though!"
2614,"I've been backpacking through SE Asia. Honestly it's going better than I thought, I was really worried."
2614,Do you travel internationally or locally?
2614,"Well, now that i'm in Asia, i'm staying there, but I'm not from Asia. "
2614,"Do you like Asian food? Like Indian, Chinese or Thai food?"
2614,"Yup, all of it! Sometimes it's really out there but I want to at least try it."
2614,Great! I was born and raised in the Philippines. We had a lot of Chinese restaurants there.
2614,That's so cool! How do you like the Phillipines?
2614,It was hot and humid but I got used to it because I was born there. I left the Philippines in 1970 and came to America.
2614,"That's cool, have you gone back since?"
2614,"Yes, I have family back there so I went back every 5 years or so.  Filipinos are so hospitable so I always stayed with family, not hotels."
2614,It must be so nice to visit home. That makes me think of all my friends and family at home!
2614,"Yes, really great. Everyone wants to invite you to their homes and take you to tourist attractions. i always gain more than 5 pounds when I visit the Philippines."
2615,Is that your favorite kind of music?
2615,Some of my favorite. I have lots of favorites as I love all types of music.
2615,Do you go to a lot of concerts?
2615,"Have not been to many lately, as been working more and more online late into the evening."
2615,What do you do? I'm a nurse
2615,I do IT Consulting and IT Technical Writing. I listen to music as I work. Lots of types of music.
2615,"That sounds intense, technical writing must take a lot of focus"
2615,It is cool for me. What music do you like to listen to? My actual favorite is Christian Rock. The Newsboys rock group is farout.
2615,"I like metal, we go to a lot of local shows on weekends when we can"
2615,"As a nurse, I am assuming you do not hear much music at work. What metal group do you favor?"
2615,"No, I sure don't! I like Brujeria, it's a Mexican band"
2615,"Interesting. I actually hear little Mexican music. I am not fimilar with that group. Kiss is considered metal, right?"
2616,i love to travel instead.lol
2616,"Me too! But since I've been diagnosed with asthma, I like to travel on chill places."
2616,wow.so sorry about that.
2616,It's ok! You learn to live with it! Let's not talk about it! What was the last trip you made?
2616,yaay i went on a boat cruise to disney land with my daughter and i felt like a kid again.lol. We had soo much fun.
2616,I'm so jealous! I would love to visit it in the future. What are your favourite games or rides in the park?

2616,"Im waiting for my son to be a little older... he is two. I think he would enjoy it more around 4 or 5, right?"
2616,"yes sure,my daughter is 6 and she hade such a memorable experience"
2616,"I can only imagine, How many days would you recommend to go to have the full experience? "
2616,i recommend 4 days.you would love it. i should talk to you about my diet journey so far.i basically eat fruits vegetables and salad these days
2616,"That's great, how do you feel with the diet? when i do diets, i feel such low energy :C"
2616,i feel great. so sorry but i just keep the energy going and i feel great about the diet.It was nice chatting with you even though am a bit shy.lol
2617,Is it the same thing as a hamburger?
2617,I guess it really depends on the type of meat. Real hamburger should be made with ham.
2617,"What, no way. Despite the name, hamburger is made of beef (cow) not ham (pig)."
2617,"Oh.  Dang.  Well, I guess I was wrong then :P"
2617,It happens to the best of us!
2617,I've been looking into my diet recently to keep my blood suger in the safe zone.
2617,That's a fantastic idea! Are you diabetic? I know that makes it more important in the short-term.
2617,Yes. I have to test my blood suger level everyday.
2617,It's definitely important to test it regularly. Do you take insulin injections or have a pump?
2617,I don't yet but my doctor said If I don't change my diet it might happen anytime soon.
2617,I have a cousin who is diabetic and has a pump. It has really improved her life!
2617,That's encouraging to hear.
2618,She told me she would think about it.
2618,I'd recommend going on some dates with them and then try to explore and see if you are romantically compatible with them.
2618,Definitely! She thought it was kinda weird when I told her i've never had candy in my life.
2618,I love candy.
2618,"I am known as the iron skittler in the skittles universe, but i've never had skittles"
2618,I haven't tried it either. Just curious if it was gross.
2618,Well you should try them and let me know!
2618,I better!
2618,So what do you do for fun?
2618,"I love to watch movies, Go fishing or just play video games."
2618,I love going to the movies!
2618,i've not been to the movie theater in a long time .
2619,"That's nice, I'm taking literature classes, sometimes it's so hard to stay focused."
2619,Some days are harder than others. What do you do for fun ?
2619,"You're right. I love to travel, my favorite place is the beach to relax. How about you?"
2619,I love the beach . There is no place better to read.
2619,Totally!!! what's your favorite book?
2619,Black sea by Jane Austen is my favorite. And yours?
2619,"Cool, my favorite is A Walk To Remember by Nicholas Sparks."
2619,I've read that one and found it brilliant! There's just this therapeutic effect that reading gives me. Any other hobby?
2619,"I totally agree!! Well, I love to cook in my free time. Do you cook?"
2619,Yeah! I'm just getting into it right now. could you recommend me some stuff to cook?
2620,I couldn't believe my eyes really.  It made me sick.
2620,"Well, the two second rule might apply here, in does here in london"
2620,In America we have a five second rule.  I guess we are just slower here.
2620,"Well, it paints a negative picture, I'm a painter in my spare time. "
2620,What kind of paintings do you paint?
2620,"Usually of where I'm from, London. "
2620,I like to sketch myself.  But I limit myself to pictures.  
2620,"Yah, I'm not that good at painting to be honest, I just do it in my spare time. "
2620,I take it in spurts.  I have three month obsessions.  Sketching was one of them.
2620,"Yeah, here in London it is never nice out, so that is what I have to do in my spare time. "
2620,"Currently, I'm learning calligraphy."
2620,"Nice, I've never learned it. Is it easy? "
2620,It just takes practice.
2620,"Yeah, i suppose so. "
2621,A girl who has trouble making friends since she moved. I relate to her alot cause I only have one close friend who I grew up with
2621,"i can relate to that , i moved alot as a child"

2621,i had great English teachers in school
2622,I love hot chocolate like I love my girlfriend- a lot.
2622,what is your family like
2622,My family is awesome. They don't mind that I work full time in a bookstore. And yours?
2622,"that's lovely , yes , but they don't like my girlfriend"
2622,That's too bad. My girlfriend does like my family but they like her. How does that make you feel?
2622,"well , we have some similarities , like we both like chocolate , but more differences"
2622,"What kind of differences? Also speaking of your girlfriend, did you know that we work at the same bookstore?"
2622,Friendship!
2622,Yes! I'm glad that we're all friends. We should all meet up at the bookstore where your girlfriend and I work soon.
2622,"Sure, That's sounds like a real plan. lol"
2622,"Great! If you don't mind, I'll bring my girlfriend along too. I think you guys will like her but not as much as me!"
2622,"Or that too, haha. Well what are you into?"
2623,what would you like to write about?
2623,"That's tough, but you should tell your parents if you feel safe"
2623,"thanks, i just need time.  I don't know how they'll react."
2623,That can be scary. Time makes everything better
2623,yes.  sometimes all i have is time on my side.
2623,that's a good idea or talk to a friend that you really trust
2623,I'm lucky I have a lot of good friends to talk to.
2623,"Im glad you have such good friends in your life, it makes life easier."
2623,"Yes, friends family and love it makes the world go round."
2623,So what else do you do for fun?
2623,I like to run and bike and watch old movies
2623,running is a great hobby . i love to write when i get the chance
2624,"No, I'm too old. But when I was in high school, my ambition was to be a jet pilot. Instead, I finished an Engineering degree in college."
2624,Hey! Being a jet pilot was always a dream of mine too! but I have asthma...
2624,Wow! all the members of my gang in high school said they wanted to become jet pilots on our yearbook.
2624,Did any of them do it?
2624,"None of us made it but all went to college and graduated. How about you, what did you end up doing?"
2624,I'm still in college. Taking criminal law.
2624,Wow! That's a great career. My  niece started with a salary of $140M right after law school.
2624,I doubt I'll get that much!
2624,You'll be surprised. Just do your best and leave the rest to the Lord! 
2624,I'm getting average grades so I'm working hard to improve them!
2624,"You can only do  your BEST, no more. Besides if you enjoy what you are doing, the salary is secondary."
2624,"I do. My father was a cop, so I guess this will be my way of continuing that legacy."
2625,There we go. All clean. Now if summer would just end!
2625,"It takes forever to start becoming fall where I live. It's a pretty, super rural area."
2625,"Yes, I am so happy when fall begins. Is that your favorite season?"
2625,I like it. I wish the weather was a nicer. Winter lasts too long?
2625,"Sometimes winter takes forever. I get more time on my computer, but right now it's really slow."
2625,That's the worst! I have terribly slow internet because of where I live.
2625,Slow internet is the worst. Are there any chances it can get better?
2625,I could get some decent connectivity if I move closer to town. 
2625,"That would be a big move, but might be worth it. I hope it works out."
2625,"I've been thinking about it, but it's a small town and I try to avoid my parents at all costs."
2625,LOL. Gotta keep that buffer. My parents are pretty far away.
2625,"Lucky duck! Mine are still married, so every time I bump into them at freaking walmart they're asking about grandkids."
2626,Wow! I've been to the Atlantic Ocean before. And I've been near the Pacific Ocean but not on the beach. 
2626,The Pacific beaches are beautiful!
2626,I would love to visit one. California DOES have excellent beach weather!
2626,It really does. So are you into people who wear leather and have black spikey hair?
2626,"Ooooh, I do like leather! The spiky hair would depend on the exact style though!"
2626,I change it up often! So what do you do for fun?
2626,I'm a pretty big bookworm. It's hard to make time to read between school and work though. You?
2626,I'm a full-time student and work 40 hours a week. So I completely understand that.
2626,That is quite the busy schedule! What are you going to school for?
2626,"Criminology, gotta keep them bad guys put away."
2626,"Oooooh, very important work! I'm a STEM geek myself. "
2626,"Science, Technology, Math, and Engineering! I loved math in highschool and my first years of college!"
2627,The only officers I respond to are the ones on my favorite video games
2627,i find it a bit sad
2627,"I find brocolli a bit sad, that stuff is icky!"
2627,"urgh yes , i like to eat healthy but not broccoli"
2627,I like sweet potato myself
2627,"sweet potatoe reminds me of home , right now i attend college"
2627,Do you like it?
2627,"i do , but i miss home"
2627,"That's understandable, do you visit at all?"
2627,"yes , i travel often south"
2627,For holidays or weekends 
2627,"for holidays , i love holidays"
2628,"Yeah, it wasn't any fun. At least I wasn't hurt physically."
2628,It is good that you were not hurt. I am sorry for your sad event. Did you loose your truck or anything else?
2628,"No, just the truck.  The only thing that makes me angry is that it was not my fault. The other driver was not paying attention."
2628,"Well, I hope the other drive pays for your loses. I had an accident long ago in 1999 and lost my car."
2628,I'm sorry that happened to you-did you have any injuries-or any other issues?
2628,"I had injuries, but was ok in a few days. Lost my coveted Jimi Hendrix CDs."
2628,Is that your favorite musician? Why were the cds coveted?  Can't  you replace them?
2628,"Yes he is my favorite, and as he is dead now his CDs are hard to find."
2628,Do you like things other than music? What do you really like?
2628,I am learning to play the guitar again. I use to play and stopped remembering. I really like music.
2628,"I used to play the saxophone.  Not well.  My kid loves music. I'm into snorkeling, myself."
2628,We should get together sometime and play our instruments. My husband and I would like to to meet your family.
2629,"I also heard about the ""Keto Breath""... is that true??"
2629,I  have no idea what keto breath is. I'm guessing the lack of carbs might cause your breath to change. 
2629,I've heard that people that do this diet have a metallic breath... One of my coworkers (from the community garden center) was telling me that! 
2629,"How can someone have metallic breath. That's just strange to me. My boyfriend is on a keto diet, and it's working for him."
2629,"I don't know! hahahah! That's so awesome, I will definitely give it a try! Did I tell you that I started volunteering on an animal Shelter?"
2629,You are? That's amazing. It's great that you're helping out animals. Do you enjoy it?
2629,I have to admit thatI absolutely L-O-V-E dogs so when they were looking for volunteers I had to jump in! Helping families and animals animals is so rewarding
2629,I'm a big dog lover myself. They're the best. I have two puppies. I bet it's really rewarding. I'm happy foryou
2629,"Oh really? I can't cause my apartment is too small... what breed are they? Im so jealous, lol."
2629,One is a lab and the other is a mixed breed. They're really energetic because they're puppies. We rescued them from the streets
2629,"Oh that's absolutely adorable (the breeds and the fact that you rescued them from the streets), It's a very noble thing to do!"
2629,"Yeah, all of the dogs I've ever owned have been rescued I like the idea of giving pets homes"
2630,Corvettes are beautiful cars.  
2630,"yes, i also like jaguars, especially old ones"
2630,They are nice.  But my first love is food.  I love to try different restaurants and copy recipes at home.
2630,me too.  what's your favorite thing to make?
2630,I adore all kinds of Asian food.  But my all time favorite is a simple perfect steak with a baked potato and steamed or broiled veggies.  
2630,sounds delcious.  I don't have much time to cook so I eat out a lot.
2630,What is your favorite kind of food?
2630,probably seafood or dessert!
2630,Both are great choices!
2630,Yes talking about it is making me hungry!
2630,Me too! I might have to call an Uber to take me to a restaurant!
2630,I prefer to drive myself.  I don't drink so that's not a problem.
2631,I played for a small school and kids really enjoyed my music.
2631,That is so nice.what genre of song do you sing?
2631,I play classic Organ. I started in my dad's church.
2631,Cool.I used to be in the choir in my home church back then.you bring back nice memories.lol
2631,It's good to hear that. I really missed my husband. He is in the Army. Haven't seen him for two months.
2631,oh wow.so sorry.what does he do in the Army?
2631,He is in infantry.
2631,I see.that is the major part of the army i guess.please stay strong and i hope you get to see him really soon.
2631,I hope that too. How is everything with you these days?
2631,Am cool i just got a job with a big engineering coming and their project engineer.am super excited with the job offer.
2631,Great. What would be your responsibilities?
2631,"my reponsibility include schedule preparation, pre planning,and resource forecasting for engineering projects."
2632,Thanks. I will get on YouTube and look them up
2632,"I cannot wait for her to go on tour again, I am hoping to go see her."
2632,Me too! She is my favorite performer. Hands down.
2632,Have you seen her live before? It is such a great time!
2632,I have. She came through here a couple of years ago and my friend and I went.
2632,You must have had such a great time! Do you go to live shows often?
2632,It was awesome! I try to. It's hard to get off work sometimes.
2632,I understand that! I'm a teacher so I have the summer off. Where do you work?
2632,"Oh, that's nice to have the summers off. I have a retail job. Do not get much time off."
2632,"Oh, yea, retail works so many holidays anymore. There always has to be a sale!"
2632,That is so true. The holidays are so busy.
2632,We try to travel during the breaks do get away from the bustle. Do you enjoy traveling?
2633,Haha! Sounds like you're a mysterious person. What are your hobbies?
2633,I like to cook and play soccer
2633,Sounds great. I like listening to music and I like hot baths especially in this freezing weather. 
2633,"Music great what do you like to listen. Freezing water....no thank you, nothing like a warm shower...."
2633,I prefer ballads. I just like to chill although some songs can make me so emotional. One genre that I hate is rap. 
2633,alright ballads is great. I like almost all type of music including rap....sorry....but if I have to choose it will be latin music. Do you like to dance?
2633,"Yes, I like to dance when I'm drunk! I won't mind any music playing then. "
2633,Thats is right when you are drunk is time to dance to everything. So do you like going to dance or a movie night 
2633,"In that case, I'd prefer a movie night. At least I know I'm sober. And you?"
2634,Do my nephew's get to experience the farm like I did Growing Up
2634,Are your nephews interested in farm living?
2634,"I try to get them interested, do you have any nephews or nieces "
2634,I have a few of each and they enjoy spending time on our family orchard.
2634,Wow an orchard! That's amazing
2634,It's really great. I got married there!
2634,Aww that's so sweet
2634,Tell me more about your experiences on the farm.
2634,Well I helped raised pigs but my dad did most the work. Ever see a pig in real life?
2634,I have! I didn't realize how big they were until I saw them in person.
2634,"I was thinking exactly the same thing, they're huge!"
2634,They are supposed to be really smart too.
2635,I had to make a routine that would get me motivated! Otherwise I'd never get anything done.
2635,"Some of the people I work with are crazy motivated, too. They make me feel like a bump on a log."
2635,I have to work at being motivated. But a routine helps with that.
2635,I can definitely see how a usual routine could enhance the structure in your life.
2635,I needed something to keep me on task. I had to move back in with my parents after college.
2635,Same here! I actually had to drop out of college because of my freakish appearance. It was good for saving money though.
2635,"Yeah, I went to a community college so I dont have huge debt."
2635,That's what I desperately wish I'd done. What did you major in?
2635,I majored in business communication.
2635,Smart! Did you have to take a lot of math courses for business?
2635,No. Just the normal college requirements.
2635,"If I could go back and do it again, that's probably what I'd gear towards then. I was majoring in creative writing. "
2636,Do you foster kids? 
2636,i do not i find it too sad
2636,I've often wanted to. My mom died when I was only 18. I think I could help kids who lose their parents. I don't know that i will though.
2636,i myself am an orphan so i am familiar with the system\
2636,Did you have bad experiences? 
2636,"i was successful, i went to a local college and studied communication"
2636,That's so good. I'm happy you found you're way. Are you working in the communication field currently? 
2636,right now i am on matrnity leave actually
2636,Is your baby a boy or a girl? How old are they? 
2636,a little boy
2636,Aww. I don't have any kids. I don't think they're in my future either. 
2636,it is a very happy time in my life
2637,"An old friend from college, sadly."
2637,That's awful. I'm sorry to hear that.
2637,"It was very tragic. But, they were loved. Many friends and family came to the funeral."
2637,That's really sweet. How are you feeling now?
2637,"Pretty sad, and nostalgic for times with my friend. I may do some artwork in their memory later."
2637,That would be a great way to memorialize them. What sort of art do you do?
2637,"I dabble in a fair amount. I like needlework. But for this, probably a brush pen painting."
2638,"I'm just kidding, I'm a mom of 2 kids. "
2638,You got me! How old are they. I believe kids are a gift from God. I had 3 myself.
2638,"They are 3 and 5, close together. "
2638,You must be around 30 years old. My oldest kit is almost twice your age.
2638,"Yeah, I'm getting up there. I eat a lot of mexican food too, it's my favorite. "
2638,"I like Mexican food, Indian, Chinese, Thai, Japanese, steak etc. I enjoy trying new flavors."
2638,"Yeah, me too. Mexican food is very filling though. One of my favorites. "
2638,My favorite Mexican food is 
2638,"My kids like fish tacos, I prefer tostadas though. "
2638,I hit the Send button accidentally. My favorite is Carne Asada with shrimp and onion topping and re-fried beans and rice on the side.  Yum-yum!
2638,"Yeah, that is good stuff. We have a few good local spots here, but none like when I lived in CA. "
2638,"I lived in California too for 4 1/2 years before my, company moved me to NY. Yes, Mexican food was special in California."
2638,My favorite taco though is beef. 
2639,I've been working out by myself but am thinking about getting a trainer.
2639,You should come work out with me and we can watch the game after
2639,That sounds like fun. Who is playing?
2639,whatever team is winning!!!
2639,My favorite sport is football. What is yours?
2639,"I like American style, gridiron football! I'm not a fan of rugby style football. Which do you prefer?"
2639,I prefer American style as well. I like college football better than national. 
2639,College football is very entertaining for sure. Were you in a college football team?
2639,"No, but I live in a college town so being able to go to a lot of games sure helps you become a fan!"
2639,Yes! and tailgating!
2639,Can't forget that! It may be the best part!
2639,"Absolutely! And tailgate parties aren't just for football anymore, people have them for basketball, hockey, baseball and other sports too! Even concerts!"
2640,"Yes, I coach girl's volley ball. What do you like about gardening"
2640,I really just love watching the flowers grow and all the brilliant colors.
2640,I would love to but I am allergic to almost every palnt. I am even allergic to apples.
2640,That's a bummer. Sorry to hear that. Is it that pollen that gets to you?
2640,"Yeah, but its not bad. I still eat them, lol"
2640,Funny. I have 3 dogs and I'm technically allergic to them too!
2640,Really? You got to fight through it
2640,I inherited them when I got married. It's what you do for people you love.
2640,I inherited a leopard gecko when I got marrie.d 
2640,"Funny! If I have to deal with the dogs, my spouse gets to deal with my love of Zinnias!"
2640,Zinnias?
2640,Yes. They're a really pretty flower that's easy to grow from seed.
2641,I know what you mean. Last spring a bad storm took out most of the farm.
2641,"Wow, that sounds terrible! I think for me, the most storm activity in our area was 2010. There were winter storms, hailstorms, flooding, all sorts of terrible weather events."
2641,wow! I never would have guessed that there would be that bad of weather over by you.
2641,"Yes, according to some people the place I live could be underwater in a few years if things continue like this."
2641,The worst kansas has ever had was quite a lot of tornados.
2641,I'm glad we've never had tornados.  Have you lived there your whole life?
2641,"Yes, I inherited the farm after my Grandma Dorothy passed away."
2641,My condolences to you...I hope you have wonderful memories of her!
2641,"Oh Yes, she used to tell the most fantastic stories!"
2641,That is exactly how I would describe my grandma.  YOu are lucky to have had her
2641,I quite agree
2641,blessings to you and your family . there's nothing nicer .
2642,"Yeah, we're pretty close, but I think I like her more than she likes me."
2642,"You mean, like, you like her as ""more than friends""? If so, that's a dangerous situation to be in."
2642,"I know! After how bad it went with Bethany I decided to hold off on starting another relationship, but, I don't know. I really like her."
2642,"And what makes you think she doesn't like you? Honestly, my advice is to NOT act on these feelings. There's a BILLION other girls out there."
2642,"Yeah, a billion other girls. That's the point of uni. Get a fresh start, and why not do it with someone who's so awesome?"
2642,Because she's a friend. And you may lose that. And she'll wonder if you ever REALLY her friend or just pretending this whole time.
2642,...that's true. I really don't want to end things badly with her.
2642,"How hot is she? If she's REALLY hot, and you're not REALLY good friends... then maybe it's worth the gamble. lol"
2642,"No, she's really been here for me. Not worth it. Even if nothing comes from it, we've got 4 years together here."
2643,How long did you swim for?
2643,"I started when I was 6, and never stopped... like I said tried to go pro and failed, and since then, just for fun... so maybe 20 years? lol"
2643,"Wow, I grew up in Florida and was almost always on the water. Sometimes swimming but mostly fishing, or paddleboarding"
2643,"That's great! I always did my swimming indoors. Enough about swimming, I must be boring you! lol... Tell me something about yourself."
2643,Well when I grew up my family was always outdoorsy. We would usually hunt a few times a week until the season closed
2643,That's impressive. What kind of animals did you hunt? 
2643,"Mostly just deer, occasionally wild pig, and once bear (sadly didn't get one that year)"
2643,Wow! Big prey! did you keep the antlers as prey? And what happened with the bear!
2643,"We kept the antlers if the deer was more than a 6-point, but when i went for bear I cam back empty handed"
2643,How long does a hunting trip for these animals last? and I meant antlers as trophies not prey (lol!)
2643,"It depends. My Grandad would go all day and come back at 9PM, but i can't sit there that long. Deer Usually move in the morning and evenings"
2643,"Right, that's smart, do you know how to track animals or pick like a fixed position and wait?"
2643,"When im in a new area ill ride around and find a trail, then find a good spot to sit"
2644,"I'm 45 with 2 kids now, I thought I met my soulmate at the time but now i'm second guessing myself"
2644,What's making you second guess yourself?
2644,The fact that he's never home to help me take care of the kids
2644,That's not good. Sounds like he needs to get his priorities in order.
2644,"Yep, not to sound like a debbie downer, but it's really hard to find a perfect soulmate"
2644,That's rough. Do you think you could talk to your husband about it?
2644,"We have, multiple times. He head is as stubborn as a rock unfortunately. "
2644,Have you thought about counselling?
2644,That's a great suggestion. Professional help might be the only way from me printing out divorce papers in the future.
2644,I wish you all the best with it.
2644,"Thank you so much, I hope your soulmate is more understanding of your needs."
2644,"Yes he is. It's not perfect, no one is, but it is wonderful to be together."
2645,The other day one of my dogs found an injured bird in my backyard!
2645,Oh no! What kind of bird? What did the dog do?
2645,I couldn't tell what kind because it was just a baby. My dog was just smelling it.
2645,"Noooooo, a baby! At least the dog didn't hurt it. What did you do?"
2645,Well I really wanted to help it but I wasn't sure how! I put it in a box and drove it to a vet.
2645,That sounds like a good course of action. Hopefully the vet helped!
2645,I hope so. I worry that the mom is missing her baby.
2645,Poor mama bird. Depending on the species she might still have more chicks to take care of though!
2645,That's true! Do you know a lot about animals? 
2645,"I'm not a biologist or anything, but I do love reading and learning about all kinds of animals, yes!"
2645,"I have been reading more about animals recently, and I decided to be a vegetarian."
2645,I'm a vegetarian too! What was the deciding factor for you?
2646, This was a smaller accident. The one when I was 12 took my arm. I always tell everyone to wear their seat belts
2646,That is terrible. I'm happy this accident wasn't as bad as the one when you were younger. How did it happen? How was the guy careless?
2646,He was drunk in the middle of the day. It was horrible. I'm okay now though. I call my prosthetic my bionic arm. lol
2646,He should be ashamed of himself. Did he go to jail?
2646,"He did, thankfully. "
2646,I hope they throw the book at him. That or they let you smack him upside with your bionic arm. How is your car?
2646,"It's okay now. I had to get it fixed after the last accident, but at least it took the burnt of the injuries. lol"
2646,Are you able to get to work or school without issues?
2646,Yes. The car works fine now. 
2646,What kind of car was he driving?
2646,It was a pick up truck.
2646,Was it totaled?
2647,Yes I like motorcycles. What kind is yours?
2647,I saved up for a big Harley after I retired. Now I'm in a motorcycle club and it's the best.
2647,"Harley's are the best bikes out there, you have good taste. Where did you retire from?"
2647,I was a Marine. Best time of my life! I've never lost a fight in my life.
2647,I've been out of a job for awhile. Employers don't really like it when you show up hungover.
2647,I used to drink a lot in the marines. Even more when I first got out. It's important to get help.
2647,"You're right, it is important. I have an appointment but there was a waiting list to get in."
2647,Do you go to AA meetings while you're waiting? Taking initiative in your recovery is hard but essential to the process.
2647,"Yea, I found one just around the corner from my house so I can walk there. I lost my license awhile back too."
2647,"That's rough, but hopefully you can get it back if you show that you're serious about getting sober. Did you have a lot of DUIs?"
2647,It was just my first one. That and my job loss have done me in. This is my rock bottom for sure!
2647,"When you hit rock bottom, there's nowhere to go but up! I wish you luck, my friend."
2648,"I'm not sure, but I think I've talent for it. "
2648,Sometimes cooking shows want theatrics more than cooking skill!
2648,"Yeah, that they do. I have liked cooking since I was young, what about you? "
2648,I like eating food more than cooking but I am learning more about it! I DO love to bake though!
2648,"Baking is great, do you ever pressure cook stuff? "
2648,"Nope, I don't have a pressure cooker! Do you think I should get one?"
2648,"I have one, but have no clue how to use it to be honest. I would invest in an air fryer. "
2648,I have heard that air fryers are very useful!
2648,"Yeah, they are great for chicken wings. "
2648,"I don't eat chicken wings very often, but I bet I've seen air-fried ones that look amazing!"
2648,"Yeah, they are good. I've baked chicken wings too. Both are great. "
2648,Now that we're talking about it I could really go for hot wings.
2648,I think you've got cooking talent too. 
2649,Im on a diet with a lot of proteins... I have to admit that I eat 6 eggs a day! dont judge me! lol
2649,"I'm also on a diet with a lot of proteins, but instead of eating eggs. I eat their mother in the form of chicken breasts. Don't judge me!"
2649,"I would never! I lol'ed with the ""eating their mother""! Chicken is so versatile and always delicious"
2649,"Yep, the greatness of chicken is that almost every part of it is edible. "
2650,Yeah it might I just wish I could a steady job.
2650,Yeah. I know the feeling. It;s like I am left without anything to do. It's pretty dull.
2650,I get that.  I probably should go back to school and get a degree or something.
2651,What do you like to do for fun?
2651,I enjoy playing baseball for my college team.
2651,That's awesome! What position do you play?
2651,Pitcher of course.  What do you like to do in your free time?
2651,I like to travel and daydream
2651,Travel is awesome.  What has been your favorite trip?
2651,I went to Iceland a couple years ago. Do you travel often for baseball?
2651,Iceland is on my list!  So far the team has only taken trips regionally.
2651,That's neat. What else do you do for fun?
2651,I love to read!
2651,What's your favorite book?
2651,Wow that would be too hard to pin down!  Recently I finished to The Goldfinch which I enjoyed.
2652,"my dog is a beagle, her name is Allie. She's my best friend."
2652,I have a Beagle too! His name is puddle! I love him!
2652,Aww what a cute name. Do you have any other pets?
2652,"I have another dog, Border Terrier, and 3 horses! How about you?"
2652,Wow! I also have a cat named Bill.
2652,I love cats! My parent's won't let me have one right now though. 
2652,Why?
2652,"My dad is allergic, or he says he is. "
2652,What about a hairless cat?
2652,I hadn't thought about one of those! I wonder if they are expensive?
2652,I think they are. You can't usually get them from a shelter at least.
2652,Ya I have never seen one up for adoption. 
2653,There was a bunch of superman comics and a few spider man
2653,That's awesome! The best thing I've discovered lately was a buffalo nickel in the console of my new car.
2653,Congrats! on the new car
2653,"Thanks! My dad said he had a the second issue of Thor, but his folks threw it away."
2653,"Too bad, you hear that a lot that comics got thrown away."
2653,Are you going to try to read your newly found comics?
2653,I have them in my living room trying to first sort out the right order to read them.
2653,Are you going to have them appraised?
2653,"there are in decent condition, do yeah I think that's a good idea"
2653,"If you have any that are particularly valuable, you may not want to handle them too much."
2653,"Good point, I think I'll hold off on reading them then."
2653,Were you a comic book fan before you found these?
2654,I'm praying for it and distracting myself skateboarding. What about your parents?
2654,"My parents are okay I guess, but in the process of a divorce."
2654,"Wow, I'm sorry to hear that. My best friend's parents divorced, he had a really hard time coping."
2654,I understand that. It's hard at times but I think that my parents will be happier apart.
2654,That's good then. I always forget that my parents are people with lives. They've always been superheroes. My dad deploying was kind of a wakeup call.
2654,That's true. But maybe your dad is in the military because he IS a superhero!
2654,Maybe! lol he can sure look like one when he's all in uniform. Meanwhile I'm wearing a t-shirt and jeans to freakin church.
2654,Hahaha. I'm all about the comfy clothes too. My dad was in the military and I used to wear his BDUs sometimes.
2654,I look up to him so much. I'll probably end up enlisting when I graduate.
2654,There can be so many opportunities when you enlist!
2654,That's what I hear! The whole free college perk is really enticing.
2654,Oh gosh yeah. I went to Stanford and it was really expensive. Free college would have been awesome!
2655,That's cool. What kind of dogs are they?
2655,one is a big Lab . the other is a little yorkshire terrier ! I also have 4 cats
2655,I would love to have a cat but I just dont know how i would be able to keep it away from all the pies i make.
2655,It's easier if you can train them as a kitten to stay off counters.  What kind of pie is your favorite?
2655,I usually make apple or cherry pies between my cashier shifts at the grocery store.
2655,apple pie is always good . i'm looking forward to pumpkin pie for the holidays
2655,Tell me about it. Pumpkin pies just get me all excited for the holidays.
2655,Me too. Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday
2655,Do you have any big plans for Thanksgiving? I'll be visiting family in Georgia.
2655,That sounds fun! I usually go to my mom's house in Florida.
2655,Ahh that's fun. I would love to get away from the cold eastern winters.
2655,I get my share of cold every fall when I go visit my sister in Canada...Brrrr!
2656,"Wow, maybe that's just unfamiliar to me because I grew up eating Italian food."
2656,"You need to take a break from Italian and start eating more kale! It's good for you, and it's delicious!"
2656,"Well my parents are from Italy, so I was really only taught how to make pasta. I'll try kale! "
2656,"Dude, you can just add kale TO the pasta. It's the best of both worlds. Your parents will be proud!"
2656,Ah yes! That's a great idea. My husband might take more convincing. He doesn't like veggies. 
2656,I used to never eat veggies. Then I had a friend die of cancer at a young age. It shocked me into eating healthier
2656,"Oh man, losing someone close to you is so tough. Especially at a young age."
2656,"It really is. I was like ""But he's too young to have cancer!"" Anyway, tell your husband you don't want to lose him. Then force some veggies on him!"
2656,"I will try that! We got married very young, so I have been with him since he was a picky teenager. Now he needs to get some adult taste buds!"
2656,"Has he gained weight since you've gotten married? I mean, I gues we all have... but has he gained a LOT?"
2656,Yes! But men can lose weight so easily. He goes through these phases where he starts going to the gym and gets skinny again. 
2656,That's one of the good things about being a guy. My girlfriend gets so upset that I can lose weight easier than her. And Kale is my secret!
2657,I went to Rome last year!
2657,Oh fun! I went there too when I was a kid but I don't think I will again.
2657,What are your memories from Rome?
2657,Mostly visiting the historical sites and quality time with my family.
2657,Lovely.  My Mother was born in Ireland so we had many trips to Europe.
2657,Oh wow! Have you been to Ireland much?
2657,"Yes, her family was from Dublin.  I have so many beautiful sweaters!"
2657,have you ever knitted a full outfit?
2657,"No, I did not learn that skill!  Though my mother was a talented knitter."
2657,I guess it probably requires a lot of practice to get the technique down.
2657,"For sure, there are so many different ""stitches"" from different geographical areas."
2657,Wow i didn't know that.
2658,"That's cool, but that's my thing... my friends know i like yellow, so I sing that at karaoke... What's your favourite song?"
2658,I prefer something I can dance to. Maybe Martin Garrix Summer Days? What do you do for fun?
2658,"I'll spotify that artist! I like video games, and you might guess Singstar is up there! What about you?"
2658,I'm a big jogger. Trying to work my way up to a marathon. Have you ever run one?
2658,"No, I would die! Don't tell me you are going for a 42k one!"
2658,"I'll definitely try a half first, but hopefully that's the plan!"
2658,Color me impressed! How much do you have to train to do even a half marathon?
2658,"It usually takes me some time to train, but on top of it being an aerobic activity it's also something that requires a lot of mental strength and stamina."
2658,"See? That's the thing that would lose me, the mental part... 21 kilometers is a 5 hour race, right?"
2658,"You've got it! It's a long time, but I bet you feel amazing after. What do you do for work?"
2658,Well good luck on the training and race! I work in a small and indie art gallery.
2658,"Thank you! That's really cool, I love art."
2659,I still have all of my Little Golden Books! I am hoping my kid will read them
2659,I actually got a tattoo of the little train that could! Which kid's story was your favorite?
2659,I liked the Pokey Little Puppy. 
2659,Oh wow! I loved that one! It the first one I remember having.
2659,That is such a small world! What is your favorite movie? Mine is Goodfellas!
2659,I have such a hard time choosing because I just like going to the movies in general. I've really enjoyed most of the Marvel cinematic universe.
2659,I have never gotten into those. They just don't hold my attention enough. 
2659,My two criteria for movies is that they keep me entertained and that they aren't too preachy.
2659,I agree with that!
2659,What are your criteria for a great movie?
2659,It needs to have some humor and quality character development.
2659,I think I like superhero movies because I like to see those with my son. I never got to do that with my dad.
2660,I am sorry to burden you with this.
2660,No problem. If you still want to be friends I would just let it go and pretend you do not know they are lying
2660,I am not sure I want to be her friend anymore. 
2660,I don't blame you as who needs a liar as a friend. You have to decide if they are worth being a friend even though they lie sometimes.
2660,"I can't help but wonder why she lied, why couldn't she just trust me. I would rather know the truth than to live a lie."
2660,Very understandable. You could confront her and see what she says but that could make things worse.
2660,"You know, you're right. I should confront her. If we aren't going to be friends anymore then what is the difference. "
2660,There ya go. Looks like you are not real big on being with her so might as well let her know that you are wise to her. Go for it.
2660,"But then again, what if the reason is something I don't want to know. What if she done it to protect me?"
2660,Indeed lies can be a can of worms. Sometimes it is better not to open the can. But if you are going forward with her you have to have trust.
2660,Oops rug
2660,I'm a married guy for over 10 years now  with a straight A student in the house so I am a bit rusty at romance advice :)
2660,I am married also for a lot longer than 10 years and the last thing I need is advice on romance. Let's talk about something else.
2661,I think so? I think it's interval training or something like that. Whatever I gotta do to indulge in pizza later.
2661,"Hahaha, pizza can be awesome! Running AFTER pizza is a mistake though."
2661,"YEAH, that's a hard pass in that regard. I'm a morning person, so I always run in the mornings."
2661,I'm the opposite. I run in the evenings because afterward I'm so pooped I just want to shower and sleep!
2661,"I can see that, but I just feel energized! Beats a cup of coffee for me."
2661,"You're not the only one, my mom is a morning runner for that reason! Says it gives her energy."
2661,"It's good to clear my head, too. Does it do that for you after a long day at work?"
2661,Oh yes! Running relaxes me after being on-the-go all day. I like to take my dog with me too!
2661,That's awesome! What kind of dog do you have?
2661,I have great pyrenees. He's beautiful but he has so much energy! I give him as much outdoor time as possible.
2661,"Oh my gosh, those dogs are gorgeous. It sounds like you give him a great life."
2661,"I definitely try to! They need a lot of ""territory"" to explore."
2662,"Well, it goes against my values to give him anything at all to be honest!"
2662,"After thinking about it I agree with you, you won.  He didn't.  Did he enter the contest?"
2662,"He did! We are both major beard enthusiasts, and so we both entered, by my beard is even nicer."
2662,"So you wouldn't have expected any of his winnings, if he won?"
2662,"Well, one of my hobbies is pillaging. So I would expect to pillage his winnings, but I wouldn't expect him to 'give' them to me."
2662,Interesting.  What other hobbies do you have?
2662,I really like fine dining.
2662,Do you have a favorite cuisine?
2662,Scandinavian cuisine is my favourite.
2662,Wow!  My family comes from Norway!  I love cod in every way!
2662,My family comes from Norway too! We like to travel by boat a lot as well.
2662,The fjords are so mesmerizing.
2663,Do you like going out to eat?
2663,"Sometimes, but it can be hard to find vegetarian meals at places in this small town. So I usually just eat at home."
2663,"I usually eat at home myself, but that's mostly to save money. What kind of food do you like to cook?"
2663,I eat like a vegetarian frat guy. Microwave dinners and peanut butter sandwiches. It's pretty bad. Maybe you can teach me some good recipes.
2663,"I would love to, but I would need to brush up on my vegetarian meal. Do you like pasta?"
2663,Of course. Like half my diet is pasta. I'm the pasta king! You know some good pasta recipes?
2663,"Yes, I make a great vegetarian lasagna!"
2663,"That sounds amazing. I tried making it one time, but it turned to slop. Maybe you can just make some for me some time."
2663,I would love to! Do you drink alcohol? I make great sangria too!
2663,"Are we becoming best friends? Yes, I drink alcohol. Sangria is my jam. Just pick a time."
2663,Awesome! We need to do this soon! I am getting hungry!
2663,I'm off on Thursday if you want to do it then. Just tell me what I need to bring.
2664,"I am, I've been on campus two years, the duration of my medical training so far"
2664,Medical training? Are you going to school to be a doctor?
2664,"Indeed I am, at it a couple of years now. I split my time between that and watching old movies during my down time."
2664,"I'm not smart enough for all that, I'm working on my music degree. I play the drums for a really cool indie band on the weekends."
2664,"Very cool! I'm sure you're selling yourself short, being proficient at music takes a good amount of intelligence."
2664,"I guess so. I think it's a different kind of smart though, not book smart!"
2664,"I do suppose if you slip up on the keyboard there are less dire consequences. A bum note instead of, say, slicing a blood vessel."
2664,"Oh, no! That would be devastating for sure. So what kind of old movies did you say you liked?"
2664,"Older ones in general, before 1980 I suppose, but there's not an official cutoff!"
2664,That's before I was born! I like some of the old silent movies that Charlie Chaplin used to do. 
2664,"Before I was born as well. Chaplin, yes! Modern Times, The Great Dictator, certainly can't go wrong!"
2664,It really is a different kind of entertainment than anything we are used to nowadays. It actually requires you to use your brain!
2665,I would be worried about sharks and jellyfish.
2665,Sharks are scary! I'm more worried about jellyfish though. Have you ever stepped on one?
2665,no but my friend has. she had a rash for a week!
2665,That sounds awful. I'll just stick to the shell collecting I think. 
2665,Yes much more relaxing! Do you get to the beach often?
2665,"I live about 45 minutes from one! I go as much as possible, but it rains so much here. Do you have a favorite coast for beaches?"
2665,"I really enjoy the Florida gulf coast. It's beautiful, but the people are weird sometimes"
2665,The weird people watching is most of the fun. You should go to the Keys in the fall. It's a magnet for crazies!
2665,Oh I would LOVE to make it down to the Keys sometime. Its on my list for sure. Have you ever been to New Years down there?
2665,"I haven't, but I am actually planning on it this year. I've recently moved to Florida and am still exploring. Are there big festivities?"
2665,From what I have heard it's wild.  Lots of fun and people just out having an amazing time.  I hope you get to go.  
2665,I'll make sure to toast in your honor for the suggestion!
2666,"Yes, I actually work for IBM. What do you do for work?"
2666,That's awesome! I'm actually an author! I love and write about the drama and mystery genres! 
2666,That's really cool. What inspired you to get into writing?
2666,"My father, he took me to the movies a lot and my dream is to get publish and then turn my novels into movies"
2666,Wow. Who would be your dream director to bring your works to life?
2666,Scorsese or Motohiro (he directed a japanese anime called Psycho Pass)
2666,Psycho Pass is amazing! What other anime are you into?
2666,I just started Season 3 actually! I love Food Wars! and if you like mystery movies/anime like I do... UN-GO is great.
2666,I'll definitely check those out. What else do you do for fun?
2666,Gaming! Im playing Legends of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel III and Atelier Ryza! Are you into gaming?
2666,"Definitely, when I have the time. I play a lot of different games - from Bloodborne to Stardew Valley. Depends on my mood haha"
2666,Ooooh! Since you like Bloodborne and you are into anime... have you played Code Vein?
2667,"If I put my mind to it, I can achieve anything! Fixing the car is small potatoes."
2667,"That's true, there are lots of YouTube videos on car repairs these days."
2667,There's a tutorial for anything and everything. I wonder if there's one for climbing Mt. Everest. That's what I really want to do.
2667,"Probably not a video tutorial, but definitely travel guides!"
2667,"Yeah, but how much cooler would a video tutorial be? lol"
2667,"It would be pretty awesome, but it would be long if they didn't cut a lot of the climb!"
2667,"All right, burst my bubble with your logic, that's fine. lol do you really need your car fixed?"
2667,"Yeah, there's something wrong with the exhaust system/"
2667,"So I talked a big game just now, but I actually know nothing about car repairs. Do you trust your mechanic?"
2667,"Not really, I need a new one but I have a recommendation!"
2667,That's a start! I find it's usually best to find trustworthy businesses through the power of networking.
2667,That's true. My last mechanic liked to charge a LOT of money.
2668,Awesome. Do you plan on watching them?
2668,"Not really, but the NFL has been around since 1920 so there's lots of teams."
2668,"Right, well they've been around for a long time for a reason. It's fun to watch. Especially when my brother is playing!"
2668,Your brother play for the NFL? Cool...what do they do? I really know nothing about the NFL.
2668,They are a cornerback for the Jaguars! I don't know much either but it is still fun to watch.
2668,Is it baseball? 
2668,"No, it's football. The NFL stands for National Football League."
2668,What does a cornerback do?
2668,The cornerback mostly covers the receivers to defend offensive plays. 
2668,So since it is National I suppose it doesn't have anything to do with college football.
2668,You're technically right. NFL is the professional league so it's separate from the college league but both are national.
2668,I have some old tapes on football my aunt gave me before she passed away. They are interesting to watch.
2669,"Wow, really? I've never heard of anyone having it that bad. That must be rough. "
2669,"It is, but luckily I can replace it with other tasty items!"
2669,Like almond milk and soy milk and stuff like that? That stuff's not bad. I only recently tried it.
2669,"Yes, I am a big fan of almond milk. They even have almond milk ice cream!"
2669,What?! This is a game changer. Does it taste like normal ice cream? I need to get some.
2669,"Yes, but maybe my taste buds are biased and I have just gotten used to it. I think you might like it though."
2669,"I need to get some for my mom, too. She's an ice cream addict, and this stuff may be healthier. Can I get it at Wal-Mart?"
2669,"Yes, they have a pretty good selection at Walmart, and most major grocery stores."
2669,"I'm gonna try some tomorrow. But if it makes me sick, I'm coming after you!"
2669,"Uh oh, I'm not gonna answer my door or phone tomorrow!"
2669,"That reminds me, have you ever seen that old horror movie ""Ice Cream Man""?"
2669,"No, is it good?"
2669,It's amazing. In a really-bad-horror-movie kind of way.
2670,"The tornado sirens went off and I had to run down to the basement with a small radio.  Luckily, the storm turned,"
2670,I'm glad you were okay! Where do you live that has tornadoes?
2670,"Thanks.  I lived in Kansas, but now I'm in Alabama.  Where do you live?"
2671,singing in the shower
2671,"Yeah, I am pretty shy, so singing in the shower is about as adventurous as I will get with singing."
2671,Same. I enjoy singing but only when no one's around. I'm super shy
2671,"Yeah, I try to be more outgoing but sometimes it's tough. I am not great at small talk."
2671,Same. Like I'll have a hard time knowing what to talk about next. Words can be super difficult. What kind of music do you like
2671,"Definitely. I am great once I get to know a person and am also pretty funny (I think). I like r&b/hip hop, some indie/alt, and rap. You?"
2671,I'm into dance and pop music. Hip Hop is nice too. I tend to like anything with a good beat
2671,I also like pop as well. Good beats are great. I like that type of music for exercising.
2671,Having music on while exercising helps me focus. Especially when I'm doing cardio
2671,"Definitely. I enjoy lifting weights, so a good beat and loud music kind of amps me up"
2671,weightlifting is great. I just started doing that this summer and I've noticed a big improvement in my mobility
2671,It's a great way to exercise and it's awesome to see the progress
2672,"Tornadoes. Terrifying, I've gotten tons of warnings but never seen one touch down like the last time."
2672,One year we had one hit in Xenia. It was bad
2672,I was so scared. I grabbed my two boys and ran to the bathroom and just clutched them to me praying.
2672,That sounds really scary
2672,"I think it was farther away than it looked because everything ended up being okay, but I've never actually seen the funnel touch the ground like last time."
2672,I've seen funnels touch down a couple times but they never came close.
2672,"It's enough to cause a heart attack, isn't it? Ugh, Justin Timberlake had to get me through the next week of my work commute."
2672,Yes. Music can definitely help get through a situation 
2672,He's my favorite. Enough with this heaviness. Who's your favorite singer?
2672,I do not really have a favorite singer.
2672,You don't like music?
2672,Oh I like music but I like lots of different types so it is hard to choose a favorite
2673,"Oh no, I can't visualize the Balto dog.  What type was he?"
2673,"A mut, but a likable one!"
2673,That sounds like my guy!  Without doing anything he brings a smile to my face!
2673,"Almost as adorable as my Siberian Huskies! ALthough, when my dogs misbehave, I threaten to put them out on the streets just the dogs from Lady and the Tramp...."
2673,I love the Disney Dog movies!  Did you see 101 Dalmations?
2673,"Of course, but Cruella Deville kreeps me out!  We are big Disney fans here! "
2673,"Me, too.  From childhood to adulthood!  Disney rocks."
2673,My dream is to retire to Florida and live out my golden years at Disney World
2673,That is a favorite state for retirement.  No state income tax!
2673,"If there were no politicians either, then it would be perfect!"
2673,Funny!  Do you have a favorite park at Disney World?
2673,"The Magic Kingdom and the ""It's a small world"" ride.  I once celebrated a birthday with chocolate cake while riding on that ride. "
2674,probably not
2674,"I think you'll be fine, i walked out with a steak accidentally once and never got told anything. cooked that baby well done."
2674,Lucky! I just got a lousy pack of gum
2674,"lol, something is something. just went today after work to pick up some beers and i saw they had a big sale. "
2674,"I could use a good beer right now... or five, haha"
2674,"it's the best, i love having a few after work to unwind."
2674,I usually have a few when I'm with friends. It helps me loosen up and not e so socially awkward.
2674,"I feel you, love having a bbq with buds and knocking a few back. you should come sometime."
2674,"Oh, for sure. I haven't been to a good BBQ in a while. What's your favorite foods to eat at them?"
2674,"I am a huge Steak man, i love mine done well."
2674,"Well?! Oh, man, medium rare is the only way to go. Thats how you get optimal flavor. Eating a steak rare just ruins it"
2674,i can eat it rare but to me a well done steak and a cold beer is heaven.
2675,I had a Volkswagen Jetta. I loved that car. Were you ok in the storm?
2675,"Yes, only a little rain here."
2675,"I'm glad. I'm going to get a haircut soon, maybe dye it. I'm tired of it being long and brown. What color should I get?"
2675,Go lighter or darker - either way is a change.
2675,"True, maybe Jet black. So, how was work?"
2675,"Work was great, I love this time of year."
2675,Fall is my favorite too; the only thing I like about summer is the pool and my roses. Are you dressing up for Halloween?
2675,"No, I'll leave the dress up for the kids.  We are having a big party though it should be a lot of fun!"
2675,"That sounds like a lot of fun. :) I love Halloween but I just had surgery, so no fun for me. "
2675,"Oh, I'm so sorry.  I hope you are recovering well and your loved ones are doting on you."
2675,"Thank you! They are being amazing. I miss my dogs since I'm staying at the in-laws, but they are the best"
2675,"I'm sure your dogs miss you too.  It's great to have nice in laws, so many people despise theirs!"
2675,I'm a lucky gal. :) It was nice chatting with you! Have a happy and fun halloween!
2675,"You too, feel better!"
2676,"I can only imagine, now kids are glued to screens and we have to reflect that!"
2676,"Kinda wish I was born in this era, but then I think I would be really distracted."
2676,"hahaha! I know what you mean, Im very into fashion and think i have style... back then people LOOKED stylish as well."
2676,I don't know.  Some of those costumes they were back then were kind of silly. 
2676,LOL! You might be right! Tell me what you do on your free time?
2676,"Mostly I practice guitar.    I play in a band,  so it's important I stay sharp.  "
2676,thats cool! What kind of music do you play?
2676,"Rock, jazz, blues, and metal.  You know,  the good stuff.  "
2676,Nice! Original stuff or covers?
2676,Mostly covers.  Our original stuff isn't very popular.  
2676,whats your favourite band and song!
2676,Zeppelin.  I love the Immigrant Song.  
2677,Congratulations! What was your major?
2677,I am a math major. I would like to teach.
2677,Teaching is such a rewarding experience. I am already a teacher. I teach kindergarten and my students call me Mr. Tom.
2677,That's awesome. I don't know what grade I would like to teach yet. Have you taught other grades?
2677,No not yet. This is my first year teaching. Are you planning on teaching math?
2677,"Yes, I am, but I was thinking high school. Maybe 10th grade or so."
2677,Sounds great. Highschool kids can be rough but if you make it interesting and fun sometimes they seem to be more engaged.
2677,"Yes, I think that is the key is to try to make it fun. Kids just need a little humor in their day I feel like."
2677,"For sure, things get boring and they need something to spice it up."
2677,I agree. I think bringing some humor to the school would be a game changer.
2677,"Humor and occasional pizza parties would certainly get my attention, haha."
2677,"Hey, not a bad idea! I'm gonna keep that in mind!!"
2678,"Do you own one? I have one, his name is Mako."
2678,I have two dogs! One's called Percy and the other is called Mayo
2678,Those are great names! What breeds are they?
2678,"One's a Pomereinian and the other is a Bulldog, love them to bits"
2678,Those are great breeds! I have only had German Shepherds but have thought about getting a smaller breed.
2678,"Yeah the smallers one are more energetic but they're adorable, I prefer pandas over dogs, lol!"
2678,Haha! Do you own or work with pandas then?
2678,"I wish I owned one! I just watch panda videos online in my free time, they're very cute"
2678,They are so cute! I bet they would make awesome pets!
2678,I'm sure they would but they're very big; they would be hard to look after!
2678,You would need a huge backyard and shelter for them. 
2678,I'd have to get rid of all my surfing equipment to make room for the Pandas
2679,I also work in an office environment were snacks are plentiful. It is difficult to say no to treats
2679,I completely understand.  It is easy to do in our country where food is plentiful and we sit at desks all day
2679,My office recently opened a gym in the building. I am hoping to spend less time snacking and more time working out in the near future.
2679,That would certainly help me to look better!
2679,It would help to look and feel better. A little exercise each day is good for you.  
2679,That sounds hard...even if I do want to look pretty!
2679,A little hard work is good for the body and the soul
2679,"i guess that's true for anything , hard work and discipline get results ."
2679,"Yes, I think you are right. You can apply this logic to many aspects of your life."
2679,Even being overweight?
2679,"Yes, the only way to change your weight, your health or anything is discipline and hard work"
2679,"i think you are right , it is important to keep fit and mentally healthy"
2680,i would like to buy BMW
2680,"They are nice, I just bought a Chrysler 300, very classy but uncomfortable seat. I got the low end."
2680,thats great. but i feel that car is my prestige. and so i have decided to buy BMW
2680,What color?  Mine is a candy apple red. It seems to change shade in the sunlight. I love the new navigation sytem.
2680,thats really good.. i would like to go with black color i love black color
2680,I probably should have gone with something more neutral. I stand out like a sore thumb. 
2680,ya okay... but even red would be fine sometimes
2680,"Yes, it is pretty. My favorite color is a slate blue. My friend talked me into getting this one because it was such a good deal."
2680,"even though your favorite color is blue, performance wise you should think of it and take decisions"
2680,"I Googled it before I got it and it had a lot of good reviews. It is used but only 100 miles, so I got a good price."
2680,thats really nice to hear.. hope i will also get a best car
2680,Are you going to get a used or new one. I don't think I have ever had a new one. This is the close as I have gotten.
2680,i would go with new one
2681,How many live at home?
2681,Just 4 the others have their on roads to go on. now my days are filled with basketball games and faux hunting trips.
2681,I still have one and I am watching plenty of hockey games.  
2681,"my little girl plays b ball, i love watching her "
2681,That is awesome basketball is a fun sport to watch and fun to coach (I coached it for 25 years)
2681,yeah my little girl is amazing. love the sport before she got into it too.
2681,Is she having fun with it?
2681,"oh she definitely does, my boy didnt' take to hunting we basically just watch the animals lol."
2681,Now that is funny - well at least you are out in nature.  It is starting to get colder where I live so outside days are numbered
2681,oh yea our last trip for the year is coming up
2681,Nice at least you wont have to cook any wild game
2681,yeah it's rough cooking venison.
2682,I love to paint more than anything?
2682,"I like drawing, my brothers and sisters are pretty artsy themselves."
2682,That's great! I love drawing in the rain
2682,i love drawing landscapes my big brother taught me how.
2682,That's great. What else do you do for fun? I'm excited for winter so I can snowboard
2682,"mostly just drawing practice, i have 5 teachers to help lol."
2682,"wow, that's great! Where do you work?"
2682,at an arts supplies store funnily enough.
2682,That's awesome! you get to really enjoy your work
2682,"yeah i get paid to be around all the art stuff, getting inspiration."
2682,How long have you worked there?
2682,"for a few years, my uncle runs the shop."
2683,For sure. Luckily I make enough money from my engineer career to cover the cost. 
2683,That's good! We just had our roof replaced two months ago.
2683,Why did it need to be replaced?
2683,We had minor leaks throughout our house. Just water spots showing.
2683,Ah I see. That's a bummer but at least it's fixed. Mine was because of hurricane damage. 
2683,Oh wow. Did you have extensive damage?
2683,Yeah a bit. The house was still standing. Just had some rough damage. Luckily the flooding wasn't that bad. 
2683,What kind of price estimates are you getting for replacement?
2683,It's going to cost around $3000 unfortunately. 
2683,"Wow, that's a lot of money for sure! "
2683,Definitely. It could have been worse though!
2683,"Yes, but fortunately insurance should take care of it, right?"
2683,Part of it. Still have to cover some of it though. 
2684,See? now i want a nice cheesecake... do you like them when they have added flavors?
2684,Yes cherry is my favorite. What is yours?
2684,orange! Lets change subjects because im getting hungry lol! What do you do for fun?
2684,I like to bike ride. Or running.
2684,do you do it for fun or to compete?
2684,Just for exercise. Bike riding is very relaxing for me.
2684,"I should try that, since im very stressed with work. Cant complain though. Do you do stationary bikes or outside?"
2684,Outside when the weather is nice. Bikes are my main source of transportation.
2684,thats smart and ecofriendly as well. Do you ride to work as well_
2684,No I am retired. But I use it to go shopping.
2684,"Oh, I cant wait to be retired... DOnt you miss the routine, though?"
2684,Yeah sometimes I miss the interactions with coworkers
2685,Hows the cost of living? Expensive?
2685,It's quite expensive there for sure. Largely due to the tech boom and high taxes.
2685,"Not a fan! my favorite food is actually cheeseburgers, so i added some baked eggplant but hated it. lol"
2685,My husband and both kids love cheeseburgers and we all dislike eggplant. Have you been to Seattle?
2685,Yes! My mother teaches in the city (university level) so i visited her a few times.
2685,That's great! How often do you get back there?
2686,oh my! Do you like orange or was it just to get back at them?
2686,I love orange!  My roommates will love it - it's our favorite team color!
2686,What does your favorite team play?
2686,"Football!!!  We love it, we go to the games as often as we can.  If we can't, we have everyone over and watch tv!"
2686,That's great! Sports are an amazing way to bring people together.
2686,"Yes, we all went to school together and we enjoy our football games and also we ride motorcycles together."
2686,I ride a motorcycle too!
2686,"Great, how long have you been riding?"
2686,Just for a little while. Mostly as a hobby and unfortunately only during this past summer due to the weather during the rest of the year
2686,"Yes, I'm a fair weather rider too.  What else do you like to do?"
2686,Smoke my pipe and play banjo. How about you?
2686,"I steer clear of tobacco but I do love the smell of a pipe.  I play the harp and piano, we'd make an interesting band together."
2687,That's cool. What is it like to own your own business? I get up at 4 am everyday to go to my job and it's a struggle
2687,I do not own a business. How long have you done that?
2687,almost 10 years. You would think I'd be used to it by now.  
2687,I admire you for being able to get up on time. I don't think I could handle waking up that early
2687,"It helps to get up, have a cup of coffee, and listen to some opera music before I start my day.  "
2687,Coffee is the drink of life. I couldn't leave without it. What kind of coffee do you like
2687,I agree!!  I like all kinds- but especially darker roasts.  I feel like they really get me going.  How about you?
2687,I like lighter roasts with creamer. Anything sweet is good for me
2687,A good creamer really makes it more enjoyable.  We do a lot of peppermint mocha flavored creamer this time of year.
2687,I've never tried that. I'll have to order some the next time I'm in a store. Everything's still pumpkin spice where I live
2687,Yes I definitely recommend it!
2687,are you doing anything cool for halloween 
2688,"Yes, for sure.  I have made so many friends through my work."
2688,ICU is a great place to work. You can make a real difference in people's lives!  Most of my friends are coworkers.
2688,What is the nature of your work?
2688,"I have two jobs, one as a nurse in the ICU and aslo partime as a pastry chef. I love to cook."
2688,Do you find the pastry chef position to be a good way to unwind?  Or is it intense too?
2688,"I worked ICU fulltime for years, but it was very intense, so I cut back hours there and started cooking. And yes, it relaxes me."
2688,Do you have a pastry that you are known for?
2688,I get a lot of orders for tiramisu. Are you a tiramisu fan?
2688,"Yes, Italian desserts can be quite tasty!"
2688,"Oh, yeah!  I'm eating a cannoli right now!"
2688,I was in Boston recently and had cannoli at Mike's which is famous locally!
2688,"Yeah, Big Mike!  He was in my pastry class at chef school."
2689,ok how about the life in the cleaning store
2689,ya its really great and i would like to work with as usual
2689,its good to hear. but i feel like you need to change your career for betterment in your life

2689,pretty impressive.. if you need any help regarding this please let me know
2689,i would like to know whether i need to to any extra courses

2689,very good move... i appreciate it. hope i see you soon
2689,yea we all are . see you soon
2689,thank you very much for listening my words with kind heart
2689,You are quite welcome
2690,Are you Jill Stein? LOL
2690,nah im just a dude watching john gresham movies with no pants haha
2690,Which movies? I could use a distraction.
2690,"anything john gresham, not his books though."
2690,I tried to listen to one of his books on Audible once. Couldn't get into it. Are the movies better?
2690,oh definitely they're so much fun and interesting to watch.
2690,"Are they murder mysteries or what? I hate evil in general, so watching the good guy win is always uplifting."
2690,"some yes, a few romance movies in there too."
2690,I don't think I can do any romance right now. Suffering a heartbreak and barely hanging on.
2690,"oh buddy are you ok? lay it on me, talking helps."
2690,"I mean. I'm good and also not, but you know. It was such a broken relationship, I'm better off without her, but my heart still aches which I really hate."
2690,"you should come on over sometime buddy, well watch some good movies and drink beer."
2691,What kind of food do you like to cook?
2691,"Desserts mostly, though I have been told I make the best Turkey and Dressing. "
2691,Yum! I love desserts. What's your favorite?
2691,Anything chocolate. I am a choclaholic (sp).  I have been trying to stay away from sugar so I sweeten is maple syrup.
2691,Huh! Does chocolate and maple syrup work together?
2691,100% maple syrup goes with anything. I sweeten my coffee with it. Add it to whipping cream and goat mile to make icecream.
2691,oooo that sounds delicious. I should try that some time.
2691,That was suppose to be goats milk..I need to proof. I have made chocolate of course but I do not butter pecan.
2691,You don't like butter pecan?
2691,"Like I said I need to proof...lol  Yes, I like butter pecan. Almost as much as chocolate. "
2691,Nice. I think I prefer chocolate but butter pecan is good too
2691,"I use goat milk because it is a type 2 milk where cows milk is a type 1. Type 2 is better on your stomach, less inflamation."
2692,my dad helped me fix it up before i went out to college.
2692,Nice. So what are you driving these days?
2692,my 68 mustang baby. love that thing.
2692,Beautiful. What is your dream car?
2692,"this one actually, i always dreamed of having one before i went off to college."
2692,That's fantastic. I would love to be driving my dream car!
2692,"yeah man it feels so good, pulling up to campus on my baby feels great."
2692,Sweet! Where do you go to school?
2692,"texas state, tech major and a minor in mechanics."
2692,That's awesome. Are you from Texas?
2692,"yessir, texas state life!"
2692,I love Texas. I have only been once but would love to go back.
2693,"Thats great, Ive considered having kids now that i have a stable job taht i do from home. "
2693,I've been deployed for so long that I don't think I want to have kids.
2693,ITs a very personal decision and not always work for everyone... do you have a pet?
2693,"No, it is too hard to have a pet when you are away for such a long time."
2693,are your deployments really long?
2693,"Yes, but I like long deployments because they get me away from every day life."
2693,what is your favourite place where you were deployed?
2693,I enjoyed my time in Germany the most.
2693,How many countries have you visited? or being deployed to?
2693,"There are so many, some of which I can't share, but Germany, Iraq, and others."
2693,"What do you do for fun when you do these trips? I cant imagine being away from my games, lol!"
2693,It depends on where we are but I enjoy visiting  museums and other famous sites.
2694,"though im french, i love tacos... do you like mexican food?"
2694,I LOVE Mexican food. Is it popular in France?
2694,"Not really, though there are some fusion french-mexican restaurants, that while expensive are to die for."
2694,Mexican cuisine has a lot of French influences. 
2694,"Oh! I didn't know that, These restaurants are mixing tacos or burritos with really old and classical dishes."
2694,So what do you like to do for fun in France?
2694,"bike, and you know travel to neighbor countries! Have you been to France or any country in europe?"
2694,"I studied in the UK, Durham near Scotland. :) I have only visited France for a few days. What's your favorite besides France?"
2694,"oh that's super cool. And favorite country after france? I love the US and Canada. Loved my time in quebec in Canada, and LA in USA, cant pick a favorite"
2694,I haven't been to Canada before. I need to go. Do you like New Orleans?
2694,"Havent been yet, but Cajun cuisine! OMG love that. I keep going back to food, lol."
2694,Cajun Food is the best! I love it. You should visit New Orleans. It's so much fun
2695,I am a bartender but I have a band also
2695,thats really good.. how you much you can earn with this?
2695,"bartending is really good money.  I only work 3 nights a week and clear 700 a week.  The band doesn't pay too much, yet, but it will."
2695,omg. 700 is really pretty much impressive figure
2695,"yeah, it's really nice to be able to cover my bills and such in just three nights a week."
2695,well over 3 night works is really good and i am also interested in it
2695,"if you're in a metro area, you can definitely make that much at a good bar.  What do you do now?"
2695,well i am a freelancer
2695,"like, a writer?"
2695,yes i write stuff for blogs
2695,"that sounds like fun, but is it lucrative?  I'd love to get paid to write!"
2695,"ya you can too, but it seems your job is fine and fun for me"
2696,I'm looking forward to hopefully being able to move to Australia. Currently saving up money from my waitressing job for it.
2696,yes ! that sounds great . i want to go to australia
2696,Australia is beautiful. Have you ever been?
2696,No i have never been but i hope i am able to one day. Have you?
2696,I've been there a few times. I love Brisbane in particular. 
2696,what is your favorite thing about it?
2696,The climate and the beaches for sure. It's absolutely beautiful there. I love beaches.
2696,"Yes, the beaches there would be really fun to go explore. Plus lots of sight seeing!"
2696,Of course! Have you been sightseeing anywhere before?
2696,I have been to Europe but never Austrailia.
2696,Nice! Where have you visited in Europe?
2696,The UK and France/  I hope to get back over and go to Germany and Switzerland.  It's so cool and diverse over there. 
2697,yes its really quite good
2697,For sure! What's your favorite song of hers?
2697,well i have many. but i can say The Edge of Glory. is my best thing
2697,Who is your favorite singer? I like Lady Gaga but Madonna is definitely my most favorite ever.
2697,apparently i love lady Gaga a lot and i am much excited
2697,I am too. It's pretty amazing to think that she began with singing at open mic nights. I could never do that!
2697,thats the greatness of her.. and that is the reason why i love her a lot
2697,She certainly can put on a wonderful show!
2697,yes she has that talent 
2697,I definitely could not sing in front of people - how about you?
2697,i am also afraid like you
2697,"I don't have the voice for it, either."
2698,I'm a fan of chicken when it's fried. Whenever I have a flight that takes me south I always hit up Popeye's chicken.
2698,I've never had it - is it a southern delicacy?
2698,It definitely is! My son loves it too. He has since just about the day he was born.
2698,How old is he?
2698,"He's about 3 and a half now. He was born blind, but he can smell fried chicken anytime it's nearby!"
2698,That's a great age. Does he come south with you often?
2698,I'm a pilot for Southwest and he has to get a little older before he can come along on a buddy pass. Why is it you don't eat red meat?
2698,That's great.  I fly Southwest all the time!  I'm actually allergic to beef!  Thankfully it's not peanuts!
2698,I don't now which one would be worse! I love steak! What's your favorite way to have chicken prepared?
2698,"I have a great overnight marinade with lime juice and spices, then I grill it up and make tacos with it!"
2698,That sounds delicious! Sometimes I'll freeze it in a marinade so that it soaks in as it thaws.
2698,I love doing that too!  I actually have a lot of chicken recipes since I can't eat beef.
2699,I have some bad memories and some good memories. Most of them were about old flings I had with some boys 
2699,yeah i remember popping fireworks at school
2699,You popped fireworks at school? Did you get caught
2699,"yes lmao but i just love blowing stuff up, not other peoples property or hurting anything though."
2699,I would be too scared to blow something up. Knowing my luck I'd end up hurting myself. omg
2699,yeah it takes a lot of caution. on the other end of the spectrum im in love wih kittens in general. so cute and cuddly
2699,Kittens are very very cute. I'm a big fan of them myself. I'm more of a dog person though
2699,oh don't get me wrong i love dogs too. i just melt around kittens
2699,Do you have a cat
2699,"4 actually lol, just adopted a few babies."
2699,That's awesome. We just adopted two dogs from the street. They're nice but super hyper
2699,"that's the best, roudy dogs are fun."
2700,you have children to?
2700,"No, not yet, but hopefully one day after I get married"
2700,I'm a teacher. What type of work are you doing?
2700,I am a barista in the evenings. What grade do you teach?
2700,I teach 5th and 6th grade math for a private school.
2700,That's amazing; what state do you teach in?
2700,Texas. We moved here about 5 years ago. I guess that's how I got to love Mexican food so much.
2700,Private school in Texas? You must be do well for yourself; you should feel proud.
2700,We do okay I guess. Where do you live?
2700,"San Diego, CA"
2700,I love the weather in southern Ca.
2700,It is very nice; one of the main reasons we stay even though the cost of living is so high
2701,"Like next month, it wont change much but the game is already solid. You know, I work at discovery channel because of pokemon"
2701,That's cool. I used to watch this American reality series. Did you watch a lot of History channel?
2702,"I love tatoos, do you have any?"
2702,yeah man and piercings.
2702,how many piercings?
2702,"just two on my eyebrows, any more and the coffee shop i work at will fire me lol."
2702,"lol that is pretty cool, i am terrified to get anything other then my ears pierced."
2702,"it just hurts for a little while, after that it just feels numb."
2702,that is not too bad. do you drink before piercings or just go for it.
2702,nah i just go for it it's not as bad as tattoos.
2702,Oh yea i hear tatoos hurt bad. 
2702,"yeah they do, i can't have too many though. the coffee shop doesn't allow them."
2702,"I do not have any, im not big on pain so tatoos are not on my agenda. The coffe shop seems strict on dress code."
2702,"they are, it's my grandfathers shop and hes very traditional. all he allows is shoulder tats and one piercing."
2702,"I am sorry to hear that, i know it can make things difficult to deal with things like that. I need to go now. "
2703,"I do, i like there non-serious stuff, to be honest... like the one with pawn shop, lol."
2703,I love the pawn shop show. I used to watch it with my dad.  I miss him!
2704,"Wow, I meet a movie star once. They filmed a movie in a printing company I worked for. His name was Harry Gardino (sp)"
2704,That's cool! I met Tom Cruise years ago. I was surprised how short he is!
2704,"Really, seems like I remember someone saying that but he doesn't look short at all. I must put shorter people around him."
2704,"Yes, I think that"
2704,Will I ever remember to proof...I meant they must put shorter people around him. A friend of mine met Elvis once.
2704,"Wow, that must have been incredible. I would have been so starstruck!"
2704,"I went to his concert in Memphis. And I stood in line at his viewing, such a sad day. I stayed in line for hours."
2704,"Oh man, that had to be surreal! I can't imagine how big that crowd was."
2704,My brother came and got me and made me go home.  I would have stayed there all day long.
2704,"Wow, were you just a little kid?"
2704,"Teenager. But I loved all his movies, even though he was so much older than me. I had my room wallpapered with his pictures."
2704,So cool. There will never be another Elvis. Such an original.
2704,He was one of a kind. But his movies are timeless.
2705,I think it helps them see that I know my ability and can achieve goals.
2705,"I agree, in my case my coworkers are dogs and cats... im a petsitter! lol"
2705,Do you do well showing them your skills?
2705,i try . it is a work in progress! So tell me about your hobbies
2705,I love to race go carts. What hobbies do you have?
2705,"Video Games, Anime, Reading... speaking of which i love Tale of Genji, great book."
2705,"I have never heard of that, who wrote that book and what is it about?"
2705,The Tale of Genji is a story about the son of an ancient Japanese emperor and the author is murasaki shikibu. 
2705,"Very interesting, I'll have to check that out"
2705,Do you play videogames?
2705,"I play games primarily on the Switch, do you?"
2705,"Absolutely, huge fan of the Switch. I love indies on the system!"
2706,Well hiking doesn't have to be on a trail.
2706,I guess you're right. WHat is your favorite type of trial to hike?
2706,I like hilly woods trails. They are more challenging.
2706,I agree! Once i went on a 3 day backpacking trail hiking trip.
2706,Yes backpacking trips are very enjoyable. Relaxing.
2706,What else do you like to do to relax?
2706,I like to ride my bicycle.
2706,trail bike or street?
2706,Street
2706,Fun! Does your city work with the bikers or is it kind of crowded with cars?
2706,It is a kinda small city so not lots of traffic
2706,Less traffic always make riding a bike much better.
2707,I don't like the texture or the flavor lol.  
2707,well when you check last time? there are more changes happened
2707,"I've tried them many times in the past and just can't like them,  I've even started writing  novel about a cucumber farmer who hates pickles. "
2707,lol thats pretty interesting for me. you better try it now at once 
2707,I'll just take your word for it.  Have you ever heard of pickle juice pops?  My son loves them.  Yuck. 
2707,thank you very much for your decision. i heard about it.. can you explain more
2707,You take pickle juice and put it in popsicle molds and freeze it.  
2707,ho  interesting... i would like to try it once
2707,Have you ever written a novel?
2707,yes i am a writer for a blog
2707,Oh that's cool.  What is your blog about?
2707,"thank you.. my blog contains many different things,but there is a item which includes recipes"
2708,I've always wanted to visit New Zealand! What do you like to do there?
2708,I love to wander around and check out what nature has to offer. It's beautiful!
2708,It seems like it! What do you do for a living?
2708,I write articles about football for ESPN. It's fun and I enjoy it quite a bit. What do you do for a living?
2708,"That's so cool! American Football or Soccer? Who's your team? And I'm boring, a financial analyst"
2708,I'm a fan of the Green Bay Packers. It's american football. Particularly NFL. I assume you're good with numbers? Haha.
2708,"Hahaha, that's my favorite team! But, I love Arsenal. And you'd think. I am, but I studied history and psychology."
2708,What made you switch to finance? 
2708,"I wanted to be a lawyer, but hated law school. :P Do you cover the packers?"
2708,I cover all teams. I was interested in being a lawyer but it was quite boring. I prefer sports and writing for sure. 
2708,I don't blame you!!!! Sports are much better. :)
2708,"I agree! The superbowl can't come quick enough, lol."
2708,"Haha, well I hope the packers win! Give Tom Brady a ticket home. It was nice chatting with you!"
2708,Definitely! Nice chatting with you too!
2709,"Thank you so much, electronics, i never thought of that one."
2709,yeah during present world recycling is very much necessary
2709,I agree so much. I wish people in my school would recycle more.
2709,really a good idea and i would appreciate it
2709,"Reduce, Reuse and recycle. I may start a few bins in my school."
2709,yea you are right. we need to be extra cautious in order to live happy in this world.
2709,"I agree, happiness comes from self but if we can help others change then that is even better."
2709,very true. i agree with you 
2709,A lot needs to change in the world. I am doing a study on the education system in America.
2709,wow exciting to know this from you. hope you will get succeed
2709,Thank you. 
2709,"you are always welcome, "
2710,"Probably should, but I haven't been caught yet."
2710,what did they do to deserve being killed?
2710,Nothing really. My wife was nice but not a great cook. My mother is the best baker I know.
2710, Did you take any pictures? I love to take pictures. Death makes for good subject matter.
2710,I took a pic of each left shoe.
2710,"interesting. I would love to be a forensic photographer, just so long as I didn't have to get up so early. "
2710,I'm not much of an early riser myself. What time do you normally have to wake up?
2710,well if I have my way....I could sleep until noon
2710,I used to be able to do that until I had kids. I suppose I can go back to that now.
2710,"well since you killed them all, I guess you could"
2710,It was probably the divorce that triggered things? Have you ever been through divorce?
2710,"I'm on my third wife now. You know what they say, ""Three is the charm"""
2711,"Yes, I am really looking forward to it. Are you married?"
2711,"Yes, but if you want to loose weight eat low glycemic. It will keep you blood sugar down and keep you from craving things."
2711,I am doing that. I am also doing intermittent fasting.
2711,Does that work?  I try not eating until about noon and only eat two meals a day. But it is hard to all the nutrients in.
2711,It's been working for me. I eat in an eight hour window. I do 10a-6p. 
2711,"If you want something sweet make some cookies with almond flour and maple syrup, one egg. It is low glycemic."
2711,"That sounds interesting, how does it taste?"
2711,Wonderful. I have flavored it with cocoa and in the mornings make it with chopped apples and cinnamon.
2711,That does sound good. You sound like a good cook.
2711,"No but I am a health nut. 1 cup almond flour, 4 table 100% maples syrup, 1 egg and whatever flavoring you want."
2711,That sounds super quick and easy. I will give that a try!
2711,"Yes, it is. And very nutritious. High in protein magnesium and potassium."
2712,"Chocolate milk is so much better than regular milk, it has so much more flavor!"
2712,Go for the dark chocolate its more expensive but its worth it! and it's better for you!
2712,"Eh, dark chocolate doesn't have that classic milk choc taste, can't give that up!"
2712,"that's true, but the dark is so much better for you.  Or maybe I'm just happy I can tell the diffeerence in the two, since otherwise I'm colorblind, lol"
2712,"The difference between dark and milk is night and day! Just like me 10 years ago and me today. Old does come with bald, with a bit of back pain."
2712,"haha, getting old is not for wimps, that's for sure.  "
2712,I'm sure not a wimp! Still winning swimming competitions to this day!
2712,"do you have your own pool, or do you have to travel to swim?"
2712,"The old community centre nearby does the job. Wish I could swim then bathe in the sun, some day..."
2712,"i like swimming, but I don't sunbathe, I'm too scared of sun cancer."
2712,"I've read the science about all that, bought the best sunscreen on the market!"
2712,"Yes, I always use sun screen, the highest SPF I can find!"
2713,I lost my perscription glasses and I worry about the target shooting. Ordinarily I am an excellent shot.
2713,Do you have another pair of glasses that you can use?
2713,"My wife offerred me hers, but they have pink lenses. "
2713,I always keep my last pair of eyeglasses in case something happens to my current ones.
2713,Smart. What's worse is that I have to bring my chiuahuahs to the vet right after shooting. IMagine me in pink glasses holding two chiuahuahs.
2713,"That would look cute! Ha! I love chihuahuas, all animals, in fact."
2713,My wife is the big chiuahuah fan. I am more a a dog person and chiuahuahs don't really qualify. I also like horses.
2713,I prefer cats over dogs. I hope nothing is wrong with your chihuahuas.
2713,"Fleas. Cats are ok, but you need to remember that if your cat was big enough, it would eat you."
2713,"I like cats, but wouldn't have one that big as a pet! I'll visit a zoo for those."
2713,"My daughter has a cat so big, it pushed her out of bed just to steal the warm spot on the mattress."
2713,That sounds like something a cat would do! Our son's cat likes to wake their kids at 2 am.
2714,what genres of movies do you like?
2714,I love documentaries and foreign films the most but enjoy the kids movies too!
2714,i enjoy documentaries as well. how many children do you have
2714,Five.  A set of twins and a set of triplets!  The twins are 5 and the triplets are 8!
2714,wow that's a full house! you must be exhausted
2714,"Yes, but I'm fortunate enough to have a rotation of 2 nannies.  I would never make it without them!"
2714,"that's great that you're able to have that help. I'm a nanny of sorts myself, although for pets"
2714,"That's great, you must love your job!  I always say my dog is my favorite kiddo!"
2714,it is a great job. allows me to express myself in ways that may not be acceptable in other professions; like my purple hair for example
2714,Moms can have purple hair too!  I'm just not confident enough to pull it off!
2714,I'm sure you would rock it and the kids would love it
2714,"Yes, they love animals.  I can only imagine the tangled leashes with my kids and a bunch of dogs!"
2715,It was a double dog dare. I couldn't walk away from it
2715,Was it uncomfortable?
2715,not at all. When I was with the ghosts I felt like I was with my people
2715,Were they interesting?
2715,Very. I'm sell snakeskin oil so I was accepted by them
2715,Any scary ones?
2715,"No scary ones, just one that I flirted with, from a distance of course"
2715,Well that isn't scary sounding. What did you eat?
2715,"The normal fare--burgers, chicken, tacos. Nothing strange"
2715,So kinda like the Casper movie?
2715,more like The Rocky Horror Picture Show.
2715,"Oh, that was a good movie."
2715,Goodnight ;)
2716,"Second grade, he looks like me, we are both very skinny and energetic, i fear for his teachers"
2716,What do you think he will want to do when he gets older?
2716,soccer player! Do you have any kids?
2716,I have a couple.  I'm trying to get my kids interested in mechanics.  I like cars.
2716,"Thats super cool! I have a C300, what do you ride?"
2716,I have a glamorous Yukon.  What do you do in your spare time.
2716,"Video Games, movies? Do you own a gaming console / PC?"
2716,I did in my younger years.  Mainly I play game apps on my phone.
2716,that-s good too. I love grindstone in apple arcade.
2716,"I'm more into relaxing when I get off from work.  My passion is beer, actually."
2716,do your brew your own?
2716,"No, but I like to try exotic beers from other countries.  Do you spend much time on video games?"
2717,I got out late in the evening. Around 9:30 PM 
2717,Yeah that is a little later than I like to leave.  
2717,What about you? What time did you leave/
2717,Not that late.  My bed time is 9.  
2717,wow. I envy you by the way. I can never go to bed by 9
2717,The older I get the more like my grandma I become.  My mom knew what she was doing when she named me after her.  
2717,haha. Your grandma must be a very nice and gentle woman
2717,She was.  I used to live down the street from her and spent alot of time with her.  
2717,"I didn't get to spend time with my grandma. However, I have to go to woke early, and I'm still on my way home"
2717,Sorry to hear that.  Have a good ride.
2717,Thank you so much. It's past your bed time though. It's almost 10 PM
2717,"Yes, it definitely is. GOod night"
2718,I have always though the ones affected the most would be Thailand.
2718,The factory I work at makes screens for the window industry.
2718,Well that sounds like a very interesting factory. My factory where I teach my yoga classes is ceiling to wall windows! 
2718,I have worked there since I was 18 and have become less social every year I have been there!
2718,"I hate to hear that, social interaction is super healthy, if its of the positive sort.  What about your factory has made you become less social?"
2718,The work environment is very loud.  Then when I get home I just want to chill with the TV.
2718,"My work environment is the opposite, VERY quiet. In my spare time I usually sit by a window or outside and write poetry. "
2718,I have been working at the factory for over half of my life.  Are you very social?
2718,"Finding workers that stay in one place for the long haul can be difficult.  I am fairly social,you?"
2718,"I really don't have friends and am very quiet in a group setting. So no, I am not."
2718,"I have two small children, so I have to do more than I would like to. We can be friends!!"
2718,"Yes, this type of communication practice may really help me come out of my shell.  What do your kids like to do?"
2718,"My children are very active. My daughter is playing softball, and competition cheer at the moment, and very social!"
2719,My younger brother used to make them
2719,I love to listen to Keith Sweat
2719,Keith Sweat? He's about 60 now?
2720,really good to know. how is the life as a stocker?
2720,It's not bad. It doesn't completely pay the bills so I do some bookkeeping and city tours too. You?
2720,well i am writer but even me also in the same boat
2720,That's great? Do you write fiction?
2720,ya sometimes i do. and it also depends on my mood that time
2720,What's your favorite book?
2720,i like invisible man. and by the way which type of items is present in your store
2720,Grocery mainly. Wegmans
2720,okay... how long you have been working there?
2720,"2 years, I'm trying to go back to school. It's so expensive though"
2720,ya of course you are right... i wish you have a good life
2720,You too! Thank you! Good night
2721,"pretty good, how is the life over there"
2721,What is it like over there?
2721,i like rock music
2721,"That is actually nice, i like rock music."
2721,amazing. even i love slow music sometimes and its based on my mood
2721,"Who are some of your favorite singers? I like Korn, Creed and then i love common"
2721,"thats really cool ya, i love Kom"
2721,The first song I heard from them was let the bodies hit the floor
2721,pretty good.  which other type of songs you like ?
2721,John Legend Ordinary people is a really great song. Take me to the king by tamela mann 
2721,okay sounds good
2721,my music tatse is so broad since i go to the clubs
2722,Do you have any tattoos or piercings?
2722,"I don't have any piercings, but I have one tattoo made of a rainbow that is actually only shades of green. What about you?"
2722,"Yes, I have a lot of tattoos. I have two full sleeves."
2722,Wow! That's impressive! How long did that take?
2722,"Well, I've been working on them for over a year actually."
2722,Are the colorful or monochromatic?
2722,"They are colorful, very colorful!"
2722,That sounds awesome! One of my piano students has some pretty interesting tats on his hands. It's fun to watch him play.
2722,I love good tattoo work. There is also a lot of bad work out there too though.
2722,There totally is. One of my professors from college is fluent in biblical Hebrew and he posts lots of mistaken Hebrew tats.
2722,That's hilarious. It makes me laugh when people don't do their research before committing to a tat.
2722,"It's like when Brittany Spears got a Chinese tattoo that she thought meant ""mysterious"", but it really meant ""weird."""
2723,Yeah just more than I can afford
2723,"Oh, that's a great car. I have a Mercedes... It is futuristic like something off of Star Trek."
2723,Nice. I work in fast food so too rich for me.
2723,Never... I don't work. I was laidoff from my last job. 
2723,Thats too bad. Getting unemployment?
2723,"Yes, but looking forward to getting a real job soon. Perhaps, I will take a job at a fast food restaurant. "
2723,It's not bad just doesn't pay much.
2723,It is probably better than the unemployment amount. 
2723,Yeah most likely
2723,"Certainly, I love to work though... getting bored at home. "
2723,I would get bored quickly if I was not working.
2723,I'm watching a lot of tv and filling out tons of applications. 
2724,Food always bring back memories ...
2724,Yes. Food reminds me of many good times with family and friends. 
2724,specially the food moms cook.... that brings in a lot of childhood memories..
2724,"Yes, my mom made many Scandinavian dishes: lefse, krumkaka, suet suppe...many memories of those foods."
2724,have you grown up in Scandinavian? 
2724,No. I am American. My mother's parents came from Norway and Sweden in the early 1900's.
2724,what state do you live?
2724,"I live in South Dakota, the Mount Rushmore state."
2724,how's the weather like there now?
2724,"The weather has been cool with some rain, but it is supposed to be warmer this weekend."
2724,wow!! do you get any snow there?
2724,"Yes, we do. Last winter was very snowy with the third highest total amount we have ever had."
2725,"well, i am a very loyal person. I care well enough about my surroundings too"
2725,Do you have a family then?  I really value mine.
2725,"i do, but i am not married yet. there's nothing i wouldn't do for family"
2725,"I couldn't agree more.  I'm the traditional type.  God first, family second.  Do you have a love interest then?"
2725,Not really. But I believe I will find love soon
2725,It will happen.  Just enjoy life.  Live adventures.  I am salesperson so I get to travel.
2725,I travel a lot too. Where was the last place you visited
2725,I have been all over the US and Canada.  How about you?
2725,"Same here. Been to about 3 countries in Europe, and China"
2725,China sounds interesting.  Did you enjoy it?
2725,"I did, and I can't wait to go back"
2725,Where do you think you will go next?
2726,I want to buy a vintage car
2726,its so nice decision. you love old cards?
2726,some old cars are very classic. What car do you like?
2726,"i always love BMW car, and its my favorite."
2726,I have BMW X3 white color. I bought last April
2726,wow amazing and i am excited.. how is the performance of car?
2726,Its really good. I use to drive Honda Accord before. This one is awesome. You will love it
2726,really??? but  i was pretty impressed with your BMW
2726,Thanks. Where do you live?
2726,In California.. and what other collections of vintage cars you have?
2726,I don't have anything now. But I like to have one vintage car
2726,okay. hope you will get one soon
2727,"Yes, it was the smell. Do you ever associate smells with place you have been when you were a child?"
2727,"Oh, yeah! My Grandmother made the best minestrone soup. Now I think of her every time I go to Olive Garden."
2727,"There is something in the air around September, that reminds me of starting school. The temperature, moisture?"
2727,Right. I grew up in New England and fall defintely can be sensed in the air there in September.
2727,"You know, I have never been to Olive Garden but I have always wanted it. It is Italian isn't it?"
2727,"Yes, good Italian food for a chain restaurant. But be prepared to loosen you clothing after one of their big meals!"
2727,"Lol. I will have to wait till I get off this diet. Italian is very high calories, but it is mainly the meat I need to stay off of."
2727,"Good for you!  Eating healthy is a hobby of mine, along with selling clothing on FaceBook."
2727,Really? Do you make them yourself?
2727,"Yes. They call me the Little Mad Hatter, either because I make hats or because I have anxiety disorder from mercury exposure... LOL"
2727,Lol...I didn't realize they sold things on Facebook.
2727,Sure. Do you use FB?
2728,yes i feel pretty bad actually and thats the reason for adopting
2728,There are so many good reasons to adopt. How many children would you like ultimately?
2728,i feel like adopting all people whom i see but it doesn't make sense anymore
2728,"Yes, you have to be careful. Do you have siblings yourself?"
2728,no i am single one.. but sometimes i used to feel like i have siblings
2728,I am the youngest of 6. I always wanted to be an only child LOL.
2728,lol.. thats cool but always having some one to share is what every one need
2728,"Yes, it is good to have people around to share time with."
2728,yes its true and i know that feel
2728,Do you have a lot of friends?
2728,i have lot of friends but not much close to my heart
2728,"Aww, I am the same way. I have a number of friends, but no ""bestie"". :("
2729,Yum!  I cannot think of much I don't love onions on.  I grow my own and have a fresh batch!
2729,"I also have a garden, but I dont grow onions"
2729,"That's awesome, don't you just love gardening?  I have been growing my own herbs and vegetables for about 5 years."
2729,I love it. It is very relaxing and makes me eat healthy
2729,Agreed. It certainly has made me feel more healthy as well.
2730,I was promoted from Sales Trainer to Director of Business Development. It's a huge raise. Have you had any good news lately?
2730,"No good news, currently looking for a job. "
2730,What kind of work are you looking for? Have you graduated college?
2730,"Yes, I have graduated from college. I would like something in accounting or the law field. "
2730,I actually went to a historically Black college even though I'm Caucasian. But I got a great education!
2730,I did too... I attended a HBCU. I know your tuition was free!
2730,Haha! I went on a baseball scholarship so it actually was. It's also where I developed my sweet tooth.
2730,I love sweets... especially chocolate cake!
2730,I've had to swear off sugar as much as I can because I gained 30 pounds!
2730,"That's understandable, it is easy to over indulge in sugar!"
2730,"Yeah I'm not really a person for whom ""moderation"" is doable."
2730,Me either... Moderation is not my best suite. 
2731,i wanna say a 20 inch 
2731,"yeah that is pretty small, but with all the money you saved you can get a new and better model next year.  "
2731,I guess i could but i think i might save it to get another portrait tattoo
2731,How many tattoos will that be then?
2731,oh not many just 6 
2731,You collect tattoos like I collect cold brew coffee.  I have five different flavors in my fridge right now.  
2731,Oh wow what a coincidence I love coffee my self it sure does help to drink it while i'm filing paper work
2731,Yeah I've got a flavor for every situation.  
2731,"I know how that can be, my tattoos of my cats each tell a different story"
2731,Speaking of cats I am searching for some new recipes since my cat used my recipe book as a scratching post.
2731,"oh my, well your speaking to the king of cooking i love to cook what type of meal were you thinking, Italian, Mexican,bbq"
2731,"I need some variety.  I am stuck in a steak rut.  I love my steaks medium rare, but I am tired of the same old thing.  "
2732,That is interesting
2732,"The term travel orginated from the Old French word travail, which means work."
2732,Have you been anywhere interesting?
2732,"Not recently, but I went to a family reunion in Reno, Nevada last spring. I had never been to Nevada."
2732,"The best place I have been to was Paris, France"
2732,"I have heard and read so much about Paris, France. What did you like the most about Paris?"
2732,Just the atmosphere. Everybody seemed so laid back.
2732,That's wonderful! I am so glad that you had a good time. Maybe I will visit there one day.
2732,I would definitely love to go back
2732,I like to travel. We have talked about taking an Alaskan cruise and going to Disney World.
2732,I went to Disney when I was a kid. Really awesome.
2732,"I went once but my spouse has never been there. We plan to go with our family, especially the grandchildren. "
2733,i have decided much more time with my family and friends.. what about you
2733,I usually have my whole family over to my house. I love to cook so it is easier here.
2733,that's really cool and spending time with family is the real happiness
2733,"Yes, I agree. Do you have a big family?"
2733,i wish to have a big family. but my family consists of only 4
2733,"Aww, that's a nice size. Do you like to cook?"
2733,"i am sorry i am a very bad cook, but i love to taste new foods"
2733,That's cool. A lot of people don't like to try new things. Do you like Indian food?
2733,of course i love it.. what about you?
2733,It's one of my favorite. I would love to make Tikka Masala. That's my favorite!
2733,great.. awesome.. feel like tasting right now/.. lol
2733,Do yourself a favor and try it the next time you are at an Indian restaurant!
2734,"well, what do you do for a living?"
2734,I have worked in the film industry for years
2734,"wow, that sounds so cool. I would like to star in a movie in the future"
2734,Go for it! Shoot for the stars! 
2734,"I will, definitely. What other things do you like? "
2734,Besides filming I like reading and writing stories.
2734,I like watching movies
2734,What is your favorite movie of all time?
2734,The Shawshank Redemption. What's yours?
2734,Dirty Dancing. I wish I could dance! haha
2734,I love dirty dancing. I can dance too
2734,That's so cool! Maybe you could teach me how to dance? In return I can show you how to start a fire with sticks in the woods.
2734,sure thing!
2735,it went before 2 weeks
2735,I bet he was hungry. I had one disappear one and put out a reward for her. Luckily someone in the neighborhood found her.
2735,very sad to hear. and good to know that some one found it
2735,"Yes, I had another one that got out of the back yard with my other dog. She got into a car with a stranger."
2735,that's crazy and even sometimes my pet used to do same thing
2735,My other dog led me to right where she had gotten into the Car. Luckily she had the vets phone number on her collar.
2735,lol. it seems you are having good time with your pets
2735,"Yes, that was a long time ago. They are both gone now but good memories."
2735,omg.. i am really sorry about it
2735,"Yeah, that is the sad thing about having bets they don't last very long. "
2735,yes very true. that moment when they left will literally makes me to cry
2735,I have decided not to have anymore. I may adopt one from a shelter though. Maybe I will do that.
2736,It was pretty gross
2736,It sounds like it!  Yuck!  Hopefully you had something to take your mind off it.
2736,"I had some podcasts I was listening to, so that helped"
2736,That's good.  Do you have any favorite podcasts?
2736,I like crime mystery podcasts
2736,"I like those as well, but I love reading the Bible and there are some great Biblical based podcasts I listen to most of the time."
2736,"Well, there's not a much better book than that! Do you go to church?"
2736,"I go weekly, but I wish I could make it more frequently.  What about you?"
2736,I go Sundays and Wednesdays. That's good that you go so often.
2736,That's a good point.  Do you have any other hobbies?
2736,"I have 4 kids, so that takes up most of my time, ha"
2736,"LOL, I hear you.  I have a half dozen myself. Thank goodness for craft shows on the weekend, which allows me a little break."
2737,Of course I caught them in the act. I am a female. I watch everything.
2737,sounds good. how about the experience?
2737,It reminded me of stories my mother would tell me about when she was a child in south Asia
2737,pretty good .. have you been to south asia recently?
2737,I have not. Maybe sometime in the future I can so visit. I would like to meet my mothers family. 
2737,thats great to hear. but i have been to it and i love their culture
2737,My mother immigrated from South Asia at the age of 8. I have learned a lot about their culture from her.
2737,really great... do you also follow that??
2737,I will just say that I still have many things to learn before I can say I follow it.
2737,of course all we know is just a drop in a ocean. there are many things to learn always
2737,I learn something new every day. 
2737,pretty impressive. and i used to be like you ..
2738,yeah i recently proposed to my girlfriend of three years and i gotta pay off that ring somehow
2738,CONGRATS!! you should work get a second job on the weekends 
2738,"I am actually looking into getting a job at the local ball field.  My dream job is to be an announcer, but you have to start somewhere."
2738,oh that's pretty cool. have you always been interested in baseball? and being an announcer? 
2738,Since i was a kid.  Do you like baseball too?
2738,"No, I'm more into college football, NFL, NBA and i just started to get into Formula 1 after watching that documentary on Netflix"
2738,SOunds like you can always find something to watch then.  
2738,"Definitely, I'm watching Netflix almost always. What about you? are you into netflix or amazon?  "
2738,I enjoy the Netflix content more.  Their original shows are usually pretty good.   
2738,For sure. I love their original content. what is your favorite tv show on their? 
2738,The Haunting of Hill House was a favorite last fall and suprisingly I enjoyed rewatching it this fall.  
2738,I'll probably watch it then. I just finished watching breaking bad. so now I wanna watch el camino
2738,Looking to el camino next also
2738,"yes, well it was nice talking to you. I had fun "
2739,Just keeping up with chores around the house. It's really the little things that pile up and take up the most time!
2739,I agree.  I'm looking for ways to earn money from home so I have more time to watch those TV shows.
2739,"Thats the key, I find I manage to enjoy the shows much more if i do some chores while also watching."
2739,"That sounds like a great plan.  I would rather have quiet reading time, you know?  Do you read?"
2739,"It works well for me. No not really, I spend most of my time watching basketball and going to concerts. What kind of books do you enjoy?"
2739,"All kinds, but mostly I only have time to read the news.  So, what chores can you do while watching TV?"
2739,"Thats too bad, the news can be so negative these days. I enjoy doing laundry and cooking while watching tv."
2739,Folding clothes and TV works well together.  I don't know.  I think the news can be entertaining.  You just can't take it too seriously.
2739,"Yea its extremely relaxing for me. It can definitely be entertaining, that is for sure. Do you enjoy rock music?"
2739,Always been a fan of James Taylor.  He wrote a lot of good lyrics in his time?  What's your favorites?
2739,Never heard any of James Taylors work. I've always been a Led Zeppelin type personally. What is your favourite song by Taylor?
2739,You've got a Friend.  I've seen Fire and I've seen Rain.  I was a disco fan back in the day too.  What's you favorite by Led?
2740,"I haven't had a chance to listen to that album, yet. "
2740,"You should, I highly recommend it."
2740,"I just realized that ""Believer"" is on that album. I have heard that song and really like it. "
2740,"Well now that you mentioned it, I didn't realize that either.  Do you have any pets?"
2740,"No, I have allergies, so I can't have pets but I fly model airplanes. Have you ever done that?"
2740,"I have once, but I have more luck with things on the ground instead of in the air. "
2740,"You must have pets, then, that stay on the ground."
2740,"I do. I have 2 cats, but work in a veterinary clinic, so I am around animals in the air, ground, and in between."
2740,That is interesting work. Do you work with just small animals or also large ones?
2740,"Small can be a relative term, but yes, I work mainly with domestic animals."
2740,"Around here, they say large animal veterinarians if they work with cows and horses and small animal if they work mainly with cats and dogs."
2740,"Exactly, same here. What do you do in your spare time besides listen to awesome music? "
2741,I think it's both
2741,ha ha ha. I am actually dating my boss :)
2741,really? that's like so cool
2741,Yeah. We hit on each other. I am in my late 20s and I think he is in his mid 30s.
2741,i hope i find love soon. or maybe i'm just picky
2741,"It will happen.! It's all about time. Until I meet him, I never thought I will fall in love."
2741,my last relationship was toxic
2741,That's sad. I think the best option is to start as a friend.
2741,"that's what I'm trying to do now, but it's not working"
2741,I think you should take it easy. You will know it when you come across one.
2741,"Yes, i will. Thank you"
2741,I wish you best of luck and make sure to have fun no matter.
2742,i love to be like him at some point of my life. but i think it wont...lol
2742,Very few are. I would love to may a tenth of him.  I don't play many games online other than Sims.
2742,i love their services as well.. i love their developments in this present trend
2742,"I used to be able to do a lot on computers but they have advanced so much, it is over my head."
2742,lol. which brand you are currently using???
2742,HP Omen laptop.
2742,great.. are you a software programmer?
2742,No...wish I was though. I have learned how to design website from code and that is about it.
2742,really cool ya.. so  you know to design a poster for a website?
2742,"Yes, that can be done in Gimp and save as a .jpg file."
2742,ya got it.. hope you learn more and wish like another microsoft CEO
2742,Yeah well I will be happy to get my website up and going. Working on a affiliate marketing website right now.
2743,It did! Sometimes the paperwork seems very repetitive. 
2743,"Agreed, having to check things repeatedly or perform certain routines would be awful."
2743,Definitely. I don't think I would enjoy doing something on a set routine for long periods of time.
2743,"I have certain routines i do over and over called rituals\ and I constantly check things like is the coffee pot off, is the door locked."
2743,is it tiring to do? I sometimes have to drive back home to be sure I turned appliances off
2743,it was . i am used to it by now .
2743,As long as it gives you peace of mind :)
2743,I hate going to the doctor though.
2743,me too! I dread the waiting room more than I do the actual visit.
2743,waiting in line drives me nuts .
2743,If only things were faster! 
2743,my dr office has it set up where i can check in online which is nice
2744,"I love tacos. My favorite is lengua with lots of cilantro and onions. It doesn't make me very girly, though. What is your favorite?"
2744,I cant believe it i was gonna say the same exact thing i love tacos de lengua
2744,En verdad? Hablas castellano? What other Latin food do you like? I really love Peruvian anticuchos. 
2744,"Oh yes, y no hablo castellano, but i do speak spanish and i love tamales menudo enchiladas, oh and posole. I have never tried Peruvian food"
2744,No peruanos are skinny!  hahaha. I love traveling in South America. where have you traveled ?
2744,"Your funny, Never been to south america but i have been to cozumel mexico on a cruise"
2744,I've never been on a cruise. I'm too shy and it seems so intimidating.  Where do you live?  I'm on the Gulf coast. 
2744,oh its a lot of fun I live in Panama city i gotta say the beach is awsome
2744,I'm a beach kind of girl myself. I try to go at least once a week when the weather is not cold. 
2744,"I could be there all day especially if there is good fishing, when i cant hunt i fish"
2744,What's your favorite bait?  Mine is Zote pink soap and/or dollar store meat. 
2744,"Zote the soap to wash close, i have never heard that , i usually use fake bait, shrimp, or squid"
2745,"Hi, I think psychiatric treatment can have many dimensions, and is not one size fits all."
2745,What dimensions?
2745,"It depends on what conditions are  being treated, on a varied spectrum of severity "
2745,interesting
2745,Why do think it is damaging?
2745,"I don't necessarily think it's damaging, I just think that sometimes it doesn't really help"
2745,I agree with that. Not everyone can be helped.
2745,Exactly.  I think it's useful to seek help.  But there has to come a time when people need to realize some people can't be helped
2745,Agreed. I have grandchidren that I would hope don't have to cope with mental health issues.
2745,how many do you have?
2745,I have two. Do you have kids?
2745,No.  Don't plan to have any
2745,I have to leave. Good-bye.
2746,Yes
2746,Are you currently living in what they call Tornado Alley?
2746,No I am in Ohio
2746,"Well, hopefully you don't have too many tornadoes to deal with!  Do you happen to have any renaissance fairs in your region?"
2746,I don't know
2746,You might check it out some time.  I bet you would have a blast.  Do you like the medieval era?
2746,Yes I do. Especially King Arthur
2746,Then I definitely recommend you check it out.  It's so much fun.  You can even dress up if you like or maybe even signup and play a role!
2746,Sounds interesting. I will check it out
2746,"I can't recommend it enough, but don't take it too seriously.  I am totally into cosplay, so something like this is right up my alley."
2746,What is cosplay?
2746,You get dress up and act like some character like a superhero or maybe even King Arthur.  It's like Halloween any day of the week!
2747,I'm never that lucky though
2747,"What did you do with the money, did you spend it?"
2747,Chances are it'll go into my gas tank
2747,"Save it for later i guess, you might meet someone special like I did. I don't think my girlfriend understands."
2747,Your girlfriend doesn't understand what?
2747,It's difficult to get her to understand when I'm trying to save money. I think we're still passionate.
2747,"Oh, I hear that. Women love to burn money like an old Chevy"
2747,"i will throw on my favourite t shirt, a dirty pair of jeans, and teach them. I love Chevy's too."
2747,I was bashing chevy for being hard on gas. I'm more of a Dodge guy myself
2747,"That's understandable considering it's age. Still, it had great success in sales for Ford, beating Chrysler and General Motors vehicles at the time."
2747,Isnt Chevy GM?
2747,It can be frustrating when you confuse a Chevy for a porsche.
2748,No one is blameless.  I just don't like to think about fault.  Do you?
2748,My ex-wife never had had any problem putting all the blame on me. The truth in relationships is always a bit less simple to arrive at.
2748,Relationships are so complicated.  I'm sorry that happened to you.
2748,It is always worse for the kids. I have one son and he is not taking it well.
2748,"Is he seeing a counselor?  I used to teach, and it seemed like counseling usually helped."
2748,"Yeah, but he is not openning up very much yet. "
2748,"Kids generally feel like they played a part in the break-up, and it makes them feel bad."
2748,"Very true. And especially for my son, who introduced my ex-wife to his wrestling coach...the guy she eventally ran off with."
2748,"Oh, dear.  That's a heavy load.  When he sees that you are getting stronger, though, he will, too."
2748,Thank you. You have been kind and your words have helped.
2748,Do some fun things together.  Be silly and laugh.  Read.  Heal.  Best wishes to you and your son!
2748,Good advice. I have been toying with the idea of taking my son on one of those 1-month long dude ranch cattle drive experiences.
2748,Great idea!  The two of you will make lots of good memories to replace the bad!!   
2749,do you have any pets? 
2749,"I do not, because I spend most of my extra time volunteering at local animal shelters.  There's no time left for a pet of my own.  "
2749,that's pretty cool. I really wanna get a golden retriever but I just don't have the time these days. 
2749,Yeah I know how that goes.  I work long hours and would hate leaving a pet home alone
2749,Yes exactly that's my only concern. So do you watch sports 
2749,Sports are not my go to when it is time to relax.  I prefer movies.  What do you usually watch?
2749,NBA season just started and I'm in a fantasy league so that's exciting. I do watch a lot of netflix. Do you?
2749,Yeah I enjoy netflix.  Their original shows are usually pretty good.  
2749,oh i love their original content. what is your favorite show
2749,Stranger things was a fun series to watch.  Have you seen it?
2749,I have not but it's definitely on my list. Have you watched breaking bad
2749,"yes, i liked it so much I finished all the seasons in record time.  "
2750,thankfully they were able to see me 
2750,"Oh, that's good. It puts me in such a crappy mood to be late. i prefer to be early just in case"
2750,to be early is to be on time and to be late is unacceptable
2750,yes! My motto! 
2750,I heard it from my leadership instructor
2750,Sounds like a smart instructor. I like to be respectful of other peoples time 
2750,defnitely but things do happen at times that cause tardiness sadly
2750,That is very true. Life has a way of being spontaneous!
2750,like a toddler who will not get dressed or keeps taking clothes off
2750,The worst!! Toddlers run on their own schedule for sure.
2750,"they are fun that is for sure. she is the first one to not like my homeade food, my 2 year old prefers chicken nuggets lol."
2750,Chicken nuggets are my daughters only main food group. I've tried everything else and that seems to be all she wants
2751,no its her wish.. i still love her
2751,That must mean you really do love and care about her.
2751,i always do. but she did not understand my caring always
2751,Maybe you should make her understand. Have you tried a marriage councellor.
2751,no i haven't tried. the thing i dont like to involve any other parties in to our relationship...
2751,"But you may loose her, isn't anything worth trying?"
2751,well i am thinking so.. let me give a final try once
2751,Sometimes it is hard to open up even to someone you love. A neutral third party often helps break the ice. 
2751,"may you are right.. i would try it once, but this is my final option to do so"
2751,I wonder if they have marriage councellors on line. It may be easier to pretend they are just a computer.
2751,"very well said.. usually i am shy person, but i can open up in online"
2751,"Me too, that is why I thought of it. I know I hold back a lot of things inside me. It think it would help both of you."
2752,Are you talking about a television?
2752,"Television?!? Heck no! I'm talking about the biggest, baddest truck in the world!  The F150!"
2752,Oh. Haha. I should have known that! I can't say I even have a tv in my house
2752,Why don't you have a tv in your house? Your missing out on knowing when its Ford Truck Month. Ya Ford!
2752,I don't have any use for a tv. I stay busy with school and work. I have many books though.
2752,Are any of your books about the history of Ford trucks? I've read some really really good ones. 
2752,I don't think I have ever read a book about the history of Ford trucks! I have a couple of Ford Tough Magazines though!
2752,Sweet. Those are good too. Really gets you in the mood for some hard hitting Ford truck mega madness. I enjoy Ford trucks. Especially the F150.
2752,"I read in a magazine that in addition to the hybrid version of the F-150, Ford now says it will make a fully electric version."
2752,Hmmm. I think I just lost my erection. A *hybrid* F150? Fully electric? That's just offensive. 
2752,I think its eccentric!
2752,I guess as long as it can haul...
2753,I can understand. I don't date either. Too scared
2753,I think I'll end up marrying myself lol
2753,I have been by myself for 15 years. At least I don't have arguments everyday
2753,oh yeah that's true. But it can get a bit lonely
2753,You get used to it
2753,"yeah. I'm a librarian, so I meet lots of people at my job anyway"
2753,I love books. Sounds like a great job
2753,for sure. what's your job if I may ask?
2753,I am retired.
2753,Must be lovely to have lots of free time
2753,"Yeah, gives me time to enjoy the grandkids"
2753,how old are they?
2754,"I certainly am! She's so smart, much unlike me!"
2754,that's really great of her.. which court she intended to choose?
2754,She decided to go to Ohio State. Which university did you attend?
2754,well i am already graduated in Cambridge... 
2754,I see. Did you like attending school there?
2754,yes of course. i love it.. 
2754,"That's great. I like simple ideas, like simple jokes, I don't think I'd do well in college."
2754,okay.. i love to be simple always.. but i am creative
2754,Do you do any crafts? 
2754,no.. but would like to do... which course your daughter thought to take?
2754,She wants to enroll in the English program but I'm trying to convince her to go into Business. 
2754,well i would also agree with you. as business would give her the best results
2755,If you ever have a chance to go to Canada I recommend you take it!  Are your brothers close to you?
2755,I'm fairly close with them. What part of canada is she in?
2755,"Manitoba.  It's relaxing, but I really miss my four cats when I go visit."
2755,"Ah, it must get real cold up there around this time of year"
2755,It seems like winter has already started!  Where do you live?
2755,"I'm originally from Maine, but I live in Florida now."
2755,I'm a little jealous.  Do you have any pets?
2755,2 Cats
2755,"Aw, I sure love cats.  Did they move with you from Maine to Florida?"
2755,"No, I moved 12 years ago. I had 1 then but sadly he died 10 years ago. I got the 2 that I have now in 2009 and 2012"
2755,I'm sorry to hear about that.  I am fearing the worst as my oldest cat is starting to get sick.
2755,"Its alright, he lived to be 16 years old. I hope for the best with your cat"
2756,I am a huge fan of Nintendo as well.
2756,I love nintendo and that series
2756,The Nintendo Switch is a nice system. Breath of the Wild is super rad.
2756,"The video games make it seem so cool, I hope they come out with one on the Nintendo Switch soon!"
2756,I do as well. I heard Breath of the Wild 2 will be coming out next year.
2756,What other things do you like to do?
2756,I love to cook. I used to do it as a profession but that took the fun out of it.
2756,Wow. I love cooking. But never have the time. What is your favorite food?
2756,"I love seafood, most of it is easy to make though. I like most food really though. How about you?"
2756,"I love seafood too.  My favorites are all shellfish.  Crabs, lobster.etc."
2756,"Yeah those are all pretty delicious. Shrimp, scallops, all of it. What do you like to cook?"
2756,I cook lots of things. Tonight I had baked fish and rice pilaf with buttered carrots.
2757,Nope! Not yet! What about you?
2757,Yes. We've been married for almost 21 years!  Do you have children?
2757,Congratulations! That's amazing! I don't have any kids yet. I'm focusing on my career right now. Do you?
2757,"That's not a bad idea, I used to work for my local cable company, and then decided to focus on a family. Yes, I have 2."
2757,Do you have any hobbies?
2757,"I do. Mostly outdoors, with my trusty companion, George.  He's a black lab.  what about you?"
2757,I like to cook. I have a dog too! Do you have any other pets?
2757,"No, not at the moment. He is the last of my children that needs raising.  What kind of dog?"
2757,I have two dogs and two cats. How old are your kids?
2757,"I have a son, 19, and a daughter, 12.  My whole family is allergic to cats, but I sure love them."
2757,I love them too! One of our cats had kittens a few weeks ago and they're adorable.
2757,"Oh my! How exciting, kittens are too precious, but nothing beats that sweet puppy breath."
2758,"Wow, well, it seems to do more harm these days"
2758,"Absolutely along with the caffeine, it comes loaded with sugar and high-fructose corn syrup which is highly addictive all on their own."
2758,"ugh, gross. I admit that I do love a cold coke while having barbeque, though"
2758,I absolutely agree. Nothing like a cold soft drink during a hot BBQ get-together. It is so satisfying. 
2758,"exactly. I recently got myself a george foreman grill, spending way too much time just sitting in the garden grilling a good steak in the evenings"
2758,Life is short for anything less than a great steak!! 
2758,sure is!
2758,I also love to grill some good vegetables along with it. Now I'm hungry lol
2758,you're welcome haha
2758,lol thank you! 
2758,currently getting into playing the guitar to have some music go along with it. The wife likes it
2758,I always wanted to learn guitar. I started some in high school but never stuck to it. Is it hard?
2759,I am currently studying to be a doctor. What is your profession?
2759,"Well, I'm still in school but I'm studying to be a librarian. Congrats on your promotion!"
2759,Thanks cool. Do you enjoy books?
2759,I do. I like fiction more than nonfiction. Do you like books? 
2759,Yes i read sometimes. I enjoy dogs and volunteer with them on the side. Animals like me haha
2759,That's nice of you to volunteer! I like recycling so I try to volunteer picking up trash sometimes.
2759,That's awesome. It's important to take care of the planet.
2759,For sure. What kind of a doctor are you wanting to be?
2759,I'd like to work with children.
2759,That's awesome! I'm not sure I could work with sick kids.
2759,Yes it can be a demanding job and not for everyone. It's tough to see that kind of thing
2759,For sure. How many years of studying do you have to do?
2760,"Same here since i work a lot i tend to relax while gardening, its also a time for my son and i to bond"
2760,"I like gardening, but I'm not terribly good at it. I am learning though."
2760,"oh trust me its a learning process, im a beginner myself i started growing veggies from scraps "
2760,"That's great! more people should garden, it's so much healthier to grow your own food."
2760,"oh yeah for sure not to mention it can save you money, my son loves watching the plants grow, and eat them"
2760,watching things grows is so exciting for kids. What else do you do ?
2760,"Well i actually started couponing, since its just my son and i, i really like to find ways to save money"
2760,"couponing is a great way to save money, I'm an accountant.\"
2760,"yes it is, i assume you must be really good with money how long have you been an accountant"
2760,"for about  years. I know a good bit about managing money, but it's not always as easy to put it into practice."
2760,haha thats funny i know what you mean i try to save save save and then my son and i will find something to splurge on
2760,"Saving is important, but it's definitely ok to splurge sometimes. "
2761,"wow, its hard to imagine things like that still exist .  life is so different her in CHicago."
2761,oh i wanna visit Chicago. david dobrik is from there? do you know who he is
2761,I have heard of him.  BUt honestly if he walked into my bar I'm not sure that I would recognize him.  
2761,oh yeah he is a youtuber. so what do you for fun in chicago 
2761,"I own a bar downtown, so people watching is a fun past time.  As you can imagine it gets entertaining.   "
2761,Yeah for sure. Do you watch netflix 
2761,"Sometimes, when I have a free evening I order door dash and watch Netflix.  Have you ever tried a food delivery service?"
2761,i tried skip the dishes one time. it was pretty dope
2761,I like choosing a random restaurant and having them bring me their most popular dish.  Have you ever tried that?
2761,I have not but now I will for sure
2761,"Yeah, that's how I learned that I love eggplant.  You never know what you will get."
2761,yeah I went to a restaurant with my friend and she made me try it. it was delicious not gonna lie
2762,"I'm not sure, the homework related to an assignment for a job I was applying for. I guess I have to either restart or forget about it, thoughts?"
2762,omg. very sad.. it would be better if you start it earlier.
2762,"Yeah, do you think I should re-start it? It was at an advertising company, they wanted me to design a poster for a new type of chewing gum. "
2762,well the thing is you have lost is completely .. so instead of wasting time u can start doing it
2762,"Hmm, I guess I will start again on it. But I'm worried about the company work culture anyhow... given my sexuality."
2762,dont worry every thing will be ok. just keep your self on
2762,I guess I don't have to admit I'm bisexual. I've heard that the management there is a bit homophobic though. I'll start again now.
2762,great decision. and what u have done to your dog for the thing which he did? u got angry on him?
2762,"Nah, I put him in the other room. He was just bored is all, since I've been busy. I'm not going to punish him. My fault."
2762,thats crazy. i think you love him right?
2762,"Of course, he's my dog, had him for years, should have known he can be short tempered sometimes when I haven't taken him for a walk in a while."
2762,lol. dogs are always like that. i love my pet too.
2762,"Anyway, thank you for the advice and moral support. Good night!"
2763,Sounds pretty amazing
2763,It really is. It helps me out a lot. You have any hobbies?
2763,I enjoy baking
2763,"I don't like baking, but I do like to cook. I've never had a sweet tooth"
2763,I make mostly breads
2763,I do like bread. I had an uncle who worked on boats in Florida and he would always make homemade bread
2763,I like to experiment with different ingredients
2763,"I have a hard time with boxed mixes, so I'll leave it to the pros"
2763,Lol. It's not hard. Just have to follow the recipe
2763,"My experience is that one mistake can ruin the batch. With cooking you can always tweak, no so much with baking. "
2763,"I tweak with the extra ingredients, after the basic recipe"
2763,What's been your most surprising twea?
2764,im not much of a people person either. i am lazy when it comes to make up but if someone else is doing it i love it.
2764,I don't think I have a bad personality. People have just done me wrong so much that it's hard to be nice anymore.
2764,That is understandble never know who to trust
2764,Ain't that the truth! I only have a couple people that I can say I am close to.
2764,I do not have a lot of friends. I am pretty anti social honestly.
2764,I hear you! It's better to make one good friend than to have many that aren't real friends. Maybe try the gyms or meetups?
2764,I have at least one good friend. I meet people but the issue is meeting after that instance
2764,I concur. I totally understand. I'm a homebody
2764,me to. i can text a person all day but actually getting together is another thing
2764,I am the same way! It's so hard to make plans now days. I hate phone calls. I prefer to text.
2764,people always seem so busy.
2764,"I know, right! Do you work? I'm also lazy sometimes."
2764,i am a stay at home mom
2764,"Oh lol! It's ok, Your  a mom and that is the hardest job EVER!"
2765,I love cats too! I have two of them. 
2765,I have 2 also! 
2765,Is it hard being a vet? I would want to take all the animals home with me!
2765,I would assume the hardest part is putting them down...
2765,I would think so too. That is why I hesitate being in the medical field. 
2765,I'm sure it's worth it from all the positives of helping people
2765,Absolutely. And the people you help is worth it. Just like the people who are blessed when you help their animals.
2765,absolutely! I would love to do it
2765,Are there any animals you would be afraid to treat?
2765,Not really but I really don't like amphibians 
2765,Completely agree! Though arachnids are a very close second! Especially the hairy ones.
2765,lol yes!!! they are very cool though I've held a tarantula and it was so light for how large it was!
2766,"that sounds nice!  I'm working towards becoming a journalist, myself!"
2766,What area of journalism do you want to go into?
2766,I'd like to report on historical stories that are still relevant.  My mom is a librarian and I've always had a soft spot for research.
2766,"Thats cool, I like political journalist myself. Especially seems how im a Libertarian"
2766,"I'm a liberal leaning libertarian, but I just can't bring myself to get stuck on the political merrygoround as a journalist"
2766,"That makes sense, but most places love to have journalists with an ideology that's separated enough that they fire shots both ways"
2766,"I don't have an issue being objective, but I do have issues with journalists who can't and the political side of the biz is rife with them"
2766,Of course it is. Most journalists i have seen especially in big media are bought off by the politicians as is on both sides
2766,"yep.  like that old joke goes, politicians and journalists should wear jumpsuits like NASCAR drivers, with patches from all their ""sponsors"" lol"
2766,"Funny, What do you think of this Katie Hill Fiasco? I think its invasive to attack the details of her personal life as she ran on being Bisexual"
2766,"I don't think that personal lives should be up for discussion unless they've done something immoral, and sexuality is not immoral."
2766,"Especially seems how it was leaked by her ex. I'm all for bashing the Democrat's bad policy as they're full of it, but keep it to that"
2767,They do have good salads! I wish their hashbrowns were vegan though. Are you vegan too?
2767,No I am not.
2767,What do you like to eat?
2767,I eat all kinds of food. I eat a lot of McDonald's. They have the best fries.
2767,They do have really good fries and I really like the McCafe. Do you like their coffee?
2767,"Yes, I do enjoy their coffee and their frozen drinks too. My girlfriend loves their frappes."
2767,They have pretty good value for the price and it's also really convenient.
2767,I use their app too and they usually have pretty good deals on there. Its the best time of the year right now. The McRib is back!
2767, I didn't even know they had an app! That's interesting. I love using store and restaurant apps to get good deals.
2767,Yeah I have a few on my phone and check when I am in the mood for something. You can even place orders on most of them.
2767,That's handy! I like being able to order ahead and skip the line.
2767,"I have honestly never tried it, guess I like the old fashioned way. Maybe I will give it a try sometime."
2768,I do live right near the ocean though
2768,oh that's so cool. I once lived in a lake front house in kelowna. it was fun 
2768,i lolve going to the beach
2768,yes me too but its winter now and its depressing 
2768,"ah, that's no good. Where i live it doesn't get very cold, so i can go to the beach year round"
2768,damn i'm jealous. here in Canada we get sun for 4 months a year
2768,"Yeah, but we only get snow once every 10 years or so."
2768,haha we are getting snow next month :(
2768,"oh, wow, it's so early"
2768,yeah i know. it makes travelling so hard 
2768,"I don't travel much, but i guess being near the beach makes up for it"
2768,it definitely does. 
2769,We're going to Canaveral Beach. I can't wait to run on the sands. 
2769,That sounds really cool! Are you going to be doing anything fun and exciting like snorkeling or swimming with dolphins?
2769,"I'd like to! I'm a bit too tall for some of the activities, though. Do you have any trips planned?"
2769,You say your too tall and I say that I'm too short! LOL. I don't have any trips planned at this time. 
2769,"I guess it's difficult either way, haha. "
2769,I wish I could take a vacation. I plan on taking one after my job assignment.
2769,Oh? What's your job?
2769,I am an engineer. I build unmanned aircraft
2769,Wow! I bet you make pretty decent money as an engineer!
2769,The pay is decent. I work for myself so I can make anywhere from $25 - $250 per hour.
2769,Is it very stressful?
2769,Sometimes it can become stressful. What do you like to do in your spare time?
2770,I like to swim for exercise
2770,Me too. I was on the swim team in high school
2770,I just swim at the beach mostly
2770,Me too these days. I love swimming at the beach
2770,In the winter I swim at the Y
2770,Thats smart. I mostly just stop
2770,At the Y I don't have to worry about the salt water
2770,oh yeah. or getting a sun burn
2770,How true. I burn pretty easy
2770,I still love to sit out there for hours. lots of sunscreen
2770,Yeah same here
2770,Good im glad im not the only one. 
2771,Yeah I came out of the antique shop and there it was.  AT least I found a great piece of furniture while i was there. 
2771,Hope the damage is covered by insurance. Similar thing happened to me at umass where I study philisophy.
2771,"yeah, it is already being taken care of.  DO you like umass?"
2771,I love it here. Good Profs and very friendly environment.
2771,Sounds like a great place.  Have you always been interested in philosophy?  
2771,Yeah. Actually most people talk to me say i look like a philosopher because my eyes are brown :D
2771,"Ha ha, tahts pretty good.  At least you have a sense of humor.  what do you do when you are not studying?"
2771,"I like photography, so walk around campus and take photos."
2771,Sounds like fun.  I play bass and spend most of my free time practicing with my band.  
2771,Wow that sounds fun. You have plans in performing in public?
2771,"We will never make it big, but we play some local gigs and enjoy what we do. "
2771,"Well, there needs to be a start. Local Gigs is a good start."
2772,"just one, a brother.  He got the good eye genes. I have to wear contacts to see anything."
2772,"ah, same for me actually. Sister got lucky, no eye problems at all"
2772,"haha, it's so weird how genetics work out. My mom and brother have blond hair and good eyes, and my dad and I have brown hair and bad eyes."
2772,"Right? damn you, genetics! "
2772,lol *shakes tiny fist at Gregor Mendel*
2772,haha. maybe one day we will have human genetics engineering anyway
2772,"pshaw, I'm 90 percent sure they do already...which is such a slippery slope!"
2772,"actually heard about a case in china recently, didn't quite go over well with the feedback"
2772,"I imagine not.  Super slipperly slope, because it will be super expensive and therefore exclusive."
2772,"maybe at the beginning, but I assume it would get cheaper the more common it becomes"
2772,"maaaaayyyyybe, I don't know.  Seems like something the 1% would try to keep to themselves."
2772,turn themselves into super-humans and let the rest of us continue to suffer of miserable eye-sight? Doesn't sound too far off either to be fair lol
2773,What do you like to do?
2773,I like to go to theme parks
2773,awsome! i enjoy shopping very much
2773,what do you like to shop for?
2773,"not anything in particular, just shopping in general.Are you married?"
2773,yes. and i have son. how about you?
2773,"I am married, and I actually have 2 kids"
2773,oh! how old are they?
2773,"6 and 14! Big gap, I know"
2773,oh wow mine is only 16 months! He's such a handful
2773,"Once they reach the age of around 4, is when they become less problematic"
2773,oh man i can't wait because this boy is so high energy!
2774,That's interesting! I'm majoring in Business but I'm considering adding a double major in Economics or Finance
2774,Economics is pretty cool
2774,I'm trying to boost my college resume so I can increase my chances of getting a good jobwhere I can travel a lot. What about you?
2774,I graduated from college several years ago. Right now I'm an accountant at a bank
2774,Do you like your job? I'm considering something in that field.
2774,i enjoy it but like most jobs it does have its bad days
2774,I can understand that. Do you like to travel?
2774,"Yes, I'm big into traveling. I really like traveling abroad. Last year I got to visit Europe with a friend of mine"
2774,Me too! I went to Italy last summer. Where did you go?
2774,"I went to Ireland, England, and Scotland. I've always wanted to travel to Italy. The food there is supposed to be amazing"
2774,It was the best food I've ever had in my life. The coffee was really good too.
2774,Are the coffees there expensive?
2775,Maybe you should move to Portland
2775,The nature there would be beautiful. I would love to take my bike out and explore.
2775,Yeah I love the environment here did you know that I am an environmental engineer ?
2775,Environmental engineering sounds awesome! I work in mechanical engineering. How long have you been working as an environmental engineer?
2775,"Only 2 years now, how about you how long have you been a mechanical engineering, and how do you like it so far ?"
2775,about 6 years . give or take a little . very rewarding as far as people i meet .
2775,That is really good to hear
2775,It definitely is. We're pretty good about keeping up with preventative maintainence. Lot less expensive to do that.
2775,Tell me more about your work Daddy it is really nice to hear such good stories
2775,I'm not your dad
2775,mom ???
2775,this is a little weird now
2775,Haha just a little humor 
2776,"Oh no, that sounds gross! I have to avoid eating much sugar for the same reason."
2776,I'm eating way to much sugar these days I need to cut it out. I drink alot of pepsi
2776,I used to drink soda instead of coffee for the caffeine.
2776,hahahaha i should try that. coke or pepsi? 
2776,"I prefer Cherry Coke to be specific, haha. :) How about you?"
2776,i've never had cherry coke. but i'll try it for sure. I think i prefer pepsi. do you like kitkat?
2776,KitKats are decent! I've heard that you can buy all sorts of weird KitKat flavors in Japan.
2776,yeah my friend told me about that. I have tried green tea kitkat
2776,"That sounds gross to me, haha. "
2776,oh it didn't taste good at all 
2776,"Is KitKat your favorite candy? Mine is Hershey bars, haha. I like to eat them after practice for the rollerblading team."
2776,yeah kitkat and fuzzy peach. my friend likes hersheys
2777,I am from Hong Kong. The countryside here in the USA is totally different than where I am from
2777,That is cool. I miss the country side since I moved to the city so I come back
2777,Big city life is much different than the country life
2777,Do you like the city or the country better?
2777,I would have to say the country!
2777,oh really! the big city is so much fun though
2777,i don't mind living in a big city. I would like to move to the country when I retire though. Peace and serenity.
2777,Yeah I know what you mean. it is harder to get a hold of things that you need though 
2777,That is so true!! I try to stick to a strict diet so I can keep my body in tune
2777,What sort of diet are you on?
2777,I am Vegan!
2777,Wow! I could never do that
2778,Ah... I remember going for one couple of years ago. I once lost a diamond at debutante ball.
2778,Oh no! that would have been terrible
2778,"Yeah. I felt terrible, but fortunate enough that someone found and returned it to organizers."
2778,That is great you have excellent luck
2778,May be... but my lucky star is my dog ;)
2778,I bet he is a cutie for sure
2778,Yeah and very active. It's a french bulldog.
2778,So gorgeous I love that breed
2778,I think they are both smart and kind among dogs.
2778,I agree. My aunt has one.
2778,Nice. you have any pets?
2778,I have a beautiful baby boy named Captain. He is a cat
2779,My 3 year old threw it out the car window
2779,My goodness! How scary! Was anyone hurt?
2779,"Noone thankfully, but my phone took a beating"
2779,I guess. I would be freaking out if I were you!
2779," I did, but its just a phone. Its not like she threw herself out"
2779,yeah you re right thank god she is safe
2779,Plus I was planning on a new phone too. Maybe she got sick of me talking about it and wanted me to just do it already 
2779,What new phone are planning to buy
2779,"I'll probably get the iPhone 11 Pro. I'd get and Android, but i dont want to deal with the security issues, and lack of updates"
2779,I prefer Android my self 
2779,"Android certainly has better compatibility with my PC, and the hardware is MUCH better, but its too unreliable for me"
2780,1 million dollars!
2780,no way! What are you going to do with it?
2780,probably buy a cat shelter and a yacht then invest the rest
2780,honestly sounds like the best kind of plan. But how will you visit all the cats when you're gone on the yacht
2780,you're right I'll need a vacation home near the cats!
2780,ooor open the shelter ON the yacht
2780,oh snap! brilliant they can have a sun deck!
2780,I'm sure they'd love it! might be a bit of an issue with all the water though
2780,they'll all have to take swimming lessons before we go... 
2780,just try to explain to them that water = lots of fish to hunt and eat
2780,i wonder if they could ban together and hunt sharks... that'd be cool
2780,"damn, cats, a yacht AND a safe swimming zone for you? this is getting better and better"
2781,I can't imagine seeing something like that. Wow.  
2781,It was beautiful. Do you like hiking?
2781,I hike sometimes.  Mostly to see waterfalls. Your favorite hikes?
2782,well people already think its bad because i still live with my mom
2782,People shouldn't  judge you because of that. I'm sure you have a valid reason why you live with her still.
2782,mostly just to save money
2782,Hey that's smart. Any particular reason you are saving? 
2782,i really like to travel. so i want to go see the world
2782,Very cool! I would like to travel as well one day. There are many fascinating things to see.
2782,where would you want to go
2782,"Egypt would be cool, see the pyramids and everything else. Machu Picchu would also be pretty cool. How about you?"
2782,id really like to go to egypt and see the northern lights in iceland. or thailand too
2782,So many sights to see. Hopefully we can see them all.
2782,i want to go to every continent too
2782,That is a great goal. How many do you have thus far?
2783,Oh how I love coco chanel! Shoes are my weakness lol
2783,"Me too!!!!  shoes are life!  I wish they were free, lol"
2783,if only! I would love to have an entire room just for shoes. I don't think i'd ever leave though haha
2783,"haha, right?  I used to clean house for a lady who had a shoe ROOM...a whole ROOM of shoes!!!!"
2783,"I aspire to be that lady! Shoes, handbags, and clothes.. who needs a best friend lol"
2783,"right?  she did give me some handmedown handbags...and I have no shame, I'm poor and love couture, I took them!"
2783,YES!! There is no shame in my game either!! You just can't beat free
2783,"right, now if I could just find someone to hand me down some of Alexander McQueen's line from this year!  hahaha"
2783,"we can dream, right? lol "
2783,"haha, seems like sometimes all I do is daydream.  Champagne dreams and draft beer reality"
2783,My daydreams mostly consist of cold fruity drinks by the beach. Or a pool! 
2783,"mmmm, blender drinks by the pool, in a Chanel bathing suit so fabulous it would be a sin to get it wet!"
2784,Lee and Alvin. We named them after their great-great-grandfathers.
2784,thats nice. keeping it in the family
2784,Yes! Do you have any kids?
2784,yes. i do. one six year old daughter
2784,Cool! Do you ever post pictures of her online? I like social media a lot but I'm always unsure about posting my sons' pictures.
2784,no. i don't think it is right for me to post her at this age.  too many negative people out there
2784,That's very true! What does she like to do?
2784,she loves to swim. and help me cook since i love to cook. she is my little helper
2784,That's sweet! I really like to eat Mexican food; maybe I should try to teach my sons to cook.
2784,we love all kinds of pasta in our house.  you should teach them.  its great quality time.
2784,Sounds like a good idea!
2784,i have a special lasagna recipe. kinda of a family secret. glad to be teaching it to my daughter
2785,do you like star wars?
2785,"I love it, but I love stat trek even more"
2785,what other movies do you like
2785,I love the morvel movies
2785,did you watch end game
2785,yes! it was so good.
2785,yeah it was great. did you watch joker
2785,"I saw it last weeked, it was so creepy but amazing"
2785,yeah it saw it yesterday it was intense. heath ledger or Joaquin phoenix? 
2785,That is so hard they were both brilliant in different ways. Ledger feels more like the comic book and Joaquine like a real person
2785,yes i totally agree with that 
2785,what about jared leto tho haha
2786,i can understand that and kids tend to make things harder
2786,Its a huge responsibility raising a little human into something that will function well in society.  
2786,thats why i have 2 dogs they are somewhat easier but at times still demanding 
2786,Dogs are cool. I actually have cats though. They are all rescues and are my best friends. 
2786,aww thats so sweet i feel like animals can become a great part of anyones family 
2787,I would love to plan a vacation there! That is my heritage along with chinese
2787,"Thats cool. My heritage is Irish, Polish, and American Indian"
2787,Interesting! What languages do are you fluent in?
2787,Just English. My family might be from everywhere but i'm the most American person you'll ever meet.
2787,I am fluent in english and spanish. What region of north america are you from?
2787,"I'm originally from Maine, but i Live in the South now"
2787,"How different is it to live in the South, being from up in Maine?"
2787,"Where I am there is a lot more money, but its also where all the Mainers go to retire so not much is different other than weather"
2787,Is the cost of living higher in the South or Maine?
2787,Maine by a lot. Its run by mostly Democrat politicians and they constantly raise taxes and their own pay
2787,I am not a political person. Thank goodness!
2787,Well personally I think its good to be informed on how they are trying to screw you
2788,"I like giving lessons, but it depends on the student as to how much I enjoy it."
2788,how many students do you currently have?
2788,10.  Do you teach?
2788,"no, just playing in my free time. like to keep it a hobby"
2788,Understandable.  I love traveling a lot.  
2788,"hell, me too. looking forward to my next trip. what's your favourite place to visit?"
2788,"I love going to the places with  mountains, like Colorado."
2788,"ah yes, gives you the best views"
2788,It is even better if it is a cabin overlooking a beautiful lake. 
2788,"and not too far away, so you can go for a swim in the summer"
2788,"Maybe do some trout fishing, to top it all off!  You fish?"
2788,"sometimes, but I'm still a beginner"
2788,Fun to try learning though.
2789,Imagine how much they could make off taxes
2789,i'd not mind paying more taxes if i had a lot more money .
2789,that's true but if theres a fixed rate for everyone it would work out for everyone
2789,that's a fair point! it seems like this could really benefit the economy and fund more government necessities
2789,exactly but most people do not see it this way
2789,"I've noticed, how do you think you could make someone change their view on it?"
2789,honestly I'm not that into politics so I don't think I care to try and change peoples minds lol
2789,well would this change make a difference in your life
2789,probably but I'm not knowledgeable enough on politics to have an in depth conversation about it
2789,I don't think you need to be! I think it's based off of morality. It's what the government thinks is wrong and it's perfectly normal to juxtapose it
2789,but when it comes to economic and global political issues I'm lost and that's what I think is important
2789,That is definitely the hard part about it. Usually I just think about how I feel towards the subject
2790,Are you married?
2790,A widower. My husband was killed in a tragic plane crash. 
2791,u should.  did you watch the football game last night? it was a great game
2791,no i don't watch football
2791,well it was great.  guess you are not a fan of the falcons?
2791,"I don't even know who the falcons are, I'm more of a magic the gathering kind of guy."
2791,well falcons are the atlanta football team. they were the underdogs but now they are rising up
2791,Are they your favorite team?
2791,i wouldn't say favorite but i support my home town team.
2791,So your from atlanta then?
2791,born and raised. where are you from?
2791,portland 
2791,midwest?
2791,"Yes, near Beaverton in the Portland metropolitan area."
2792,i meant seattle 
2792,"That is all the way on the west coast, are you close to Seattle?"
2792,yeah I'm. we get so much rain here
2792,"Well, it's not all bad as rain helps with crop irrigation and provides water for hydroelectric power plants."
2792,that is true. do you get lots of snow where you live
2793,"I think it has something to do with my awful dental history while in the service. I should have gone to the dentist more,"
2793,"My grandfather used to be in the service, how many years did you serve?"
2793,I was in for 20. Kept planning to retire and kept reupping! When did your grandfather serve?
2793,"I think it was around the 1960's, very admirable work you guys do!"
2793,Thanks. It can be scary as much as it is rewarding. And then you lose your teeth! 
2793,Haha! Hope everything goes smoothly. What do you do in your spare time?
2793,I like to read. My favorite bokk right now is Ender's Game. Have you read it?
2793,I have heard of it but I never got the chance to read it unfortunately. I'm not much of a reader if I'm being honest
2793,What about movies? Do you have a favorite?
2793,"Yeah I enjoy movies, my favorite is 7 days in hell starring Andy Samberg and Kit Harrington; I'm a huge tennis fan!"
2793,I've never heard of that one. I must check it out!
2793,I definitely reccomend it! What do you do for a job?
2794,I usually hike in the local state park. It's nice to get away from work for a little while!
2794,It seems like a nice way to relax
2794,For sure! I work over 60 hours a week so I need the time to relax. Do you like to hike?
2794,I love the outdoors so i do it as often as i can 
2794,Where do you like to hike?
2794,I go in my home town a lot but my favorite is in the Virgin Islands National Park.
2794,"Wow, I've never been there! I think my boss has but I don't like to talk to him."
2794,oh no is he not a good boss?
2794,Not really. He makes me do all of his own work. :( Where do you work?
2794,i work at our community hospital and i have a coworker who is like that
2794,How do you handle it?
2794,she is a brown nose to the boss so she is her favorite so alot of the times i just have to deal with it 
2795,What's a beginner's way to start playing?
2795,I would just watch a how to video and play with friends at home till you're confident enough to go to the casino 
2795,I always get scared to go to casinos because if I do super well I feel like I'd be kicked out
2795,lol noooo they can tell if you're actually counting cards vs skill/ luck
2795,Isn't counting cards considered being skilled
2795,well skill for cheating vs skilled at the game like stratigizing 
2795,Oh wow I didn
2796,"I ride my horse on the weekend, it relaxes me."
2796,i would love to be able to have horses
2796,"It is an expensive hobby, luckily I had some help from family. "
2796,It's great that you can afford such a cool hobby. I'd love to be able to afford horses. I'd post on horse subreddits if I had a horse.
2797,Currently doing spanish
2797,Spanish huh? I was just doing a great Cheech Marin impression on my son's last camping trip. Why did you choose Spanish? 
2797,"haha how did he like it? and it's quite useful i reckon, plus easy to learn"
2797,Everybody got a kick out of it. It's not as good as my Dangerfield. But i save that for the other scout leaders. Spanish will come in handy.
2797,sounds like a fun trip already lol. you speak any other languages?
2797,No. I had to take Spanish in high school but I was muy mal.
2797,always time to pick it back up 
2797,Ya. Maybe some day. Did you say you speak additional languages besides Spanish? 
2797,"no, just Spanish"
2797,Got it. Well I wish you much luck in your studies. Soon you'll be bueno.
2797,working on it!
2797,Great!
2798,I think people want to do something its just that everyone doesn't know how to actual solve this problem
2798,theres lots of food banks and volunteer places but i dont think people care if it doesn't affect them
2798,I think people are too wrapped up in their own lives...
2798,yeah i agree. do you do anything to help
2798,sometimes I volunteer downtown and I drop food off when I can
2798,that sounds good. my old high school used to do a canned food drive for thanksgiving
2798,yes I try to send a meal to a veteran every year
2798,wow thats really nice. id like to do that too
2798,you can through walmart they have premade bags for like $15
2798,oh really?? that would be awesome im going to do that
2798,it's good to give if you can especially for the holidays 
2798,yeah i know a lot of people are by themselves and it must be hard
2799,i like it because i have more room for my stuff
2799,"Same, no cooking or food preparing in dorm rooms, I guess I'm weird that way "
2799,right i do miss a homecook meal though 
2799,"i love homecooked meals , but i eat way too much junk food ."
2799,junk food is my favorite and i have no kids so i can eat all the junk i want 
2799,"weird is good . i do some weird stuff , too"
2799,i like to go the pool for 3 hrs a week so thats pretty weird
2799,ha! I don't even want to go to the pool hehehe
2799,the pool is my safe space 
2799,sounds like you like to escape and have some alone time once in awhile 
2799,every now and then its good to relax and have some quality time by myself
2799,agree ! helps to be alone and relax
2800,My car was completely totaled! And they didn't even stop for insurance!
2800,"I hope that insurance gives you a good payout! They can raise their rates so high, though."
2800,Yeah that's what I fear the most. MY insurance has to get raised because of someone else. That's unfair
2800,It really is. How much do you think the total amounted to?
2800,"It's about $14,000 in damages. How can people drive so carelessly?"
2800,I hope they weren't impaired in some day. :( I'm glad I work at home so I don't have to go out and drive.
2800,That must be wonderful. How'd you land a job like that?
2800,I work as an editor. I did it in the office but they let me go home and do it there. What is your job?
2800,"I'm a software developer, so in reality, I could work from home just like you! But my bosses prefer me there"
2800,"Wow, do you need a degree for that?"
2800,I got one just to be safe! In reality you don't need one if you can prove you've got the skills
2800,That makes a lot of sense.
2801,i have been going to sephora for many years now.  but i use to just by perfume.  now i am a makeup junky
2801,"Same I love how many brands they carry, especially in there online store"
2801,yep.  i wish they would have more sales. they are kinda pricey but worth every penny
2801,"Yes they are not cheap, you can always get their goods in  their standalone boutiques, lease departments in high-end department stores, and through the e-commerce section of its website"
2801,i like to shop online to make my list.  then i go in store to test everything.  it is like an adult candy store
2801,shopping online is always my go to because I can do it in my PJ's
2801,that is true.  but i find myself losing self control and buying a lot more than what i need
2801,yeah it was trouble for me . . . shopping ! ! i would just buy everything i wanted
2801,i like to mix and match and get somethings from the drugstore.  
2801,"ya, its nice to go the cheaper places sometimes"
2801,it is amazing how far drugstore makeup has come along.  it are really stepping up their game
2801,They do! Is inexpesive and good quality!
2802,"yeah, he spray painted a building. "
2802,what did he put on the wall?
2802,honestly i don't wanna know
2802,did he get arrested?
2802,"luckily not, but he has to pay a fine. or rather, me"
2802,why you? make him work for the money!
2802,"he doesn't have any at the moment. But I will make sure he pays it back, he has to learn his lesson"
2802,I would make him clean the house for a month to pay it off and I mean clean everything! he needs to learn his leason 
2802,"plus, nice and clean house for me? sounds perfect "
2802,exactly!!! he will hate it but oh well
2802,should have thought about that before making that poor wall suffer 
2802,how old is he?
2803,i like the guitar
2803,"I like the guitar, too. My cat likes to listen to the sound it makes in songs."
2803,i play the violen
2803,"Oh, nice! Violins are such pretty instruments! How long have you been playing?"
2803,since i was 4 years old
2803,Wow! Did you take private lessons?
2803,yes and my father tutored me 
2803,So he plays too? Wow. My parents loved comic books so I do too.
2803,i think that is great parents always influence their children
2803,"Yes, I'm grateful to have such great parents."
2803,my parents have passed  i cherrish those memories
2803,Sorry to hear that - you must miss them!
2804,I don't know where to begin. I own more than 20 homes
2804,Have you thought of hiring staff to help you take care of them?
2804,I rent most of them out. I have family members occupying a few as well 
2804,That sounds like a nice balance. Do you enjoy your own work?
2804,"I wouldn't have it any other way. Having a successful, sustainable career allows more time for me to saddle up one of my horses and go riding"
2804,"I hear you, in this economy it would be nice to have a career that would give me more time to skate, it's one of my passions."
2804,Are you talking about rollerskating or skateboarding? I would break my neck doing either one. 
2804,"I meant rollerskating, sorry! It definitely takes some practice to get it down."
2804,I broke one of my ankles as a child. I've never really been able to successfully roller skate. 
2804,"You know, skating is quite popular in the UK. I'd love to visit sometime."
2804,I didn't know that. Hopefully you will get to visit
2804,"Yes. Maybe, I will see them film some movies or television programs. That would be cool!"
2805,oh no! what makes you scared of them
2805,"The novels that I have read, especially the crime novels around theme parks."
2805,Crime novels around theme parks? I've never thought about crimes that could go on around there
2805,There are several of them. one is Joyland by Stephen King.
2805,I'll definitely look into that! Stephen King has written some of my favorite books
2805,You should definitely read that but don't blame me after that ;)
2805,"It's ok, I'll be glad I'm saving the money anyways haha"
2805,ha ha ha. You have any pets?
2805,I've got a Corgi! Do you have any?
2805,I do. I have two cute golden retriever dogs 
2805,I've always wanted a golden retriever. They're huge but so cuddly
2805,They are also smart and kind.
2806,do they get along?
2806,I think they are perfect for each other. Like its almost scary. I hope they behave as well with the new baby
2806,aw when is the baby coming?
2806,2 weeks from now. I wish it was sooner.
2806,oh man I remember the last few weeks were awful
2806,"Ya, but it is all worth it in the end"
2806,yes it is! are you having a boy or girl?
2806,I'm having a girl
2806,do you have a name picked out?
2806,"I'm not sure yet, but i'm sure ill know when I see her"
2806,thats so sweet! do you plan on breastfeeding?
2806,"Yep, I did for the first to so might as well continue with her."
2807,With 2 kids i can be really hard!
2807,"I understand, you can only do as much as your schedule allows."
2807,Exactly I'm glad you understand! hows your schedule?
2808,Yes I have read. after that I wish I had a real dragon and I could train it.
2808,"Agreed, that would be badass."
2808,"Truely, badass.... I would be like a king :D :D :D"
2808,"man, you could even train the dragon to help you steal a crown"
2808,I have a parrot. she's a joker. last time she flew around and dropped ink all over my shirts.
2808,"haha, that's ALMOST as good as a dragon. can she talk?"
2808,she can talk a bit. I am still training her.
2808,what's the word she uses most frequently?
2808,She could call my name and say Hi and Bye.
2808,"aww that's lovely. i don't have any pets myself, not enough time"
2808,"well, they are great companions. It's always good to have a pet."
2808,"for sure. i usually try to get rid of my loneliness by watching romantic comedies, to be honest"
2809,"Yeah, we've been together forever.  He's awesome though and really supports me.  What does your husband do?"
2809,my husband owes his own accounting firm
2809,"Oh nice, you get your taxes done for free  :)  I wish my husband had a similar job.  We are both poor.  I'm a gymnast."
2809,yes.  i am glad i don't have to deal with it.  nice to have it done by someone that i can trust
2809,"Isn't it weird how you can hate doing something that's part of your regular life - like you doing taxes, or that I HATE the feel of chalk?"
2809,'the feel of chalk'? like on the board or actually touching chalk
2809,"touching it at all.  Isn't that crazy, I'm a gymnast but can't stand putting my hands in chalk.  I have to use it all the time though!"
2809,hope you enjoy being a gymnast.  i work for a large clothing company and i LOVE fashion
2809,That sounds so glamorous!  I would love to be a fashionista and work for a large clothing company.
2809,anyone can be a fashionista these days.  just start a youtube channel
2809,I hear that folks are making a shocking amount of money on YouTube.  Maybe I should change careers from being a gymnast
2809,or you can teach gymnast on youtube
2810,I love music! What kind of music do you read? 
2810,I love reading classical music! What kind of music do you like?
2810,I like all kinds of music. I'm not really into classical though. My grandmother used to try to get me to go to the Opera with her. 
2810,"I was dragged along to a lot of orchestras and for signed up to play, so it slowly became a big part of me. What strays you away from it?"
2810,It just seems dreary to me. I also think it's too fancy for me
2810,"Yeah the fancy part can get really annoying. If you every want to give it a shot, you can go to a college orchestra. Those are really informal!"
2810,"Thanks for the idea! Maybe I can find some handsome, tall man to take me. LOL"
2810,Maybe make a tinder date out of it! Don't have to worry about talking haha
2810,That would be perfect! I am thinking about doing just that! If I can get a hair appointment
2810,I bet you could make it look wonderful by yourself. What are you needing done?
2810,I love my hair. It's just very long and thick! The color of it is a perfect shade of red .
2810,"That's a lovely color! Mine is super thick too, it's hard to maintain it. I ended up just cutting it off"
2811,"Thanks for the advice, I've just been so stressed out this week, I haven't slept in at all."
2811,i know what you mean . do you take exercise for it ? it helps !
2811,"I've heard about it, but never tried it."
2812,Oh that is nice. Yes I have a pet a cat named Callie...How old is your puppy? 
2812,he is just under a year old . How old is you cat?
2812,"Ok cool. She is about 3..I hope I can take her to college with me, after I graduate High school that is."
2812,Are you exited for college? I graduated two years ago
2812,Yes I am i really cant wait for it actually..Im sure the experience will be way different than High School
2812,I had a great experience i'm sure you love it
2812,"Thank you I hope so..Maybe I will learn something exciting, if I dont party too much that is haha"
2812,what are you planning on studying 
2812,Women hahaha
2812,like women and gender studies or women?
2812,"No I was just kidding..Something in IT/Computer science, something like that..What did you study?"
2812,"Nice! I studied early child hood education, I'm a kindergarten teacher now"
2812,Oh wow that is so awesome!
2813,oh im sorry for your loss. what do you feel like chatting about tonight?
2813,Have you tried any new recipes lately? I love cooking and I am running out of ideas!
2813,no nothing new. but i did make some great home made chili tonight.
2813,"Man, that sounds really delicious. Where'd you get the recipe?"
2813,from my husband. its good and simple. depending on what kind of spices you put in it
2813,"A week ago i made ghost pepper salsa, that stuff made everybody cry. It would be great in chili too!"
2813,that sounds super hot. Do you prefer hot instead of mild?
2813,Definitely the hot. Of course I always pay for it later.
2813,well i cant handle to much hot lol. im week.
2813,I understand. I once went to a restaurant that makes you sign a waver to eat their hot wings!
2813,wow thats the craziest. well how old are you?
2813,Over 50! Probably not much older if I keep burning my insides like this! How about you?
2814,It's red and that's my favourite colour!
2814,Ah. I thought you are sentimental because of your grandpa's car?
2814,Maybe slightly. If it was blue I might have already sold it. I do already have a car.
2814,I really don't have any sentimental values may be because my step-mother adopted me and I hate her.
2814,I'm sorry to hear that. Was she abusive to you?
2814,Yeah kinda. It made it worse when I first met my birth mother accidently when I was sixteen.
2814,How did you end up meeting your birth mother? Was your step-mother jealous? 
2814,I found some letters in the house. Small investigation lead me to her.
2814,"That sounds kind of fascinating.I'm sorry to hear you went through it, though. "
2814,It's all good. Now I am planning to move with my birth mother.
2814,Oh good! So it's a happy ending after all. I think my Prius should be ready at the shop. I better be going!
2814,Not there yet but soon it will be all happy ending. 
2815,of course i was.  i always wanted a little minnie me
2815,It must be a wonderful feeling to have a child! :)
2815,"the greatest.  i never had baby fever. but now that i am a mother, i will never want anything else"
2815,Eventually I want to be a mother too! I just get so scared about pregnancy
2815,it is scare for all... first time mothers and 5 time mothers all the same.  dont believe anyone that says otherwise
2815,"I've heard it can affect your body for life, it's so scary"
2815,oh yeah.... things will never be the same. think about it... a little human was made in it
2815,Yeah it feels super unnatural for some reason. It's an incredible sacrifice and I respect every single mother!
2815,it takes a toll on your body as well as your mental health. parenting is not for everyone so you have to be sure u can handle it
2815,"I'm leaning towards adoption, but I feel like it might not be the best for the child"
2815,adopting or birthing is the same.... do u have what it takes to be a mother and raise a child. birthing is only one small step
2815,I'm not sure. I wonder if that will change the older I get
2816,yeah i love singing while running
2816,Singing while running sounds really difficult. I'd be out of breath really quickly. I like to sing when at home.
2816,it actually helps me keep my mind off of my own fatigue 
2816,"Interesting. Have you ever heard of ""sing along with Mitch?"""
2816,"No, I have not what does it mean?"
2816,It's a 60's show where Mitch and a bunch of other singers sang songs along with the audience.
2816,Oh! that sounds cool too bad I'm very young and have not heard of that show.
2816,I'm too young to have watched it myself. But I have heard of it. The 60's must have been fun.
2816,I wonder what kind of songs they sang!
2816,I'm sure it probably wasn't death metal. I love death metal!
2816,My roommate was in a death metal band! He had the perfect voice for screamo!
2816,Damn I wish we met I play guitar we could have jammed! 
2817,Both for school and leisure readings.
2817,What are you going to school for?
2817,I am learning to become sports physio. I used to be a very fast runner and can run long distances.
2817,Very cool. I work at museums in New York and am not athletic at all!
2817,I am not an athletic anymore due to my unhealthy diet. I'm disgusted.
2817,I'm sorry to hear that. Could you ease back into it and slowly get back to where you were?
2817,I am trying to. But it's really hard.
2817,I bet it is. Do you track your fitness? Sometimes it helps to see the progress in an app.
2817,Yeah. That is why I am studying to become a physio. I am my first client.
2817,Oh very cool! 
2817,Yeah. I learn and apply as I gain my degree.
2817,Do you like museums?
2818,yeah me too. What's your favorite color?
2818,i like green . i want a green colored museum where i can be the curator
2818,interesting. My favorite color is blue
2818,I like to go to the musuem in my city. It has dinosaur exhibits and space exhibits
2818,my favorite are the space exhibits. i work on rockets
2818,I would love to travel in a rocket one day. I want to visit mars
2818,me too! i would like to work in space eventually
2818,I wonder what life on other planets is like. 
2818,i wonder if there even is life on other planets
2818,"Yes even thought its only hypothetical life forms, I think they exist. We just havent found them yet."
2818,i think youre probably right since the universe is so big
2818,I think it will continue to grow
2819,I like going to concerts and dancing!
2819,Concerts are awesome! What type music do you love the most?
2819,hmm I would say death metal!
2819,Oh cool. I love death metal! Do you still live at home?
2819,"No,I dont I moved to a city with lots of Italian places since I love the food so much!"
2819,"Me too. Although, the other day I had the worst lasagna I've ever had. I should have gotten spaghetti!"
2819,You can never go wrong with that!
2819,"No you can't. However, right now I'm craving an apple pie at the end of summer. Too bad I have to wait 10 months for that! "
2819,But you can always eat apple pie!
2819,"I know, but I love the end of summer specifically. Almost as much as I love Rita Hayworth!"
2819,I'm sure Rita is very special!
2819,she's indeed . timeless and iconic lady !
2820,Being a parent is never easy. But I bet it is so rewarding.
2820,"It's definitely more challenging on your skills when you're a single parent, doing everything alone without the support of someone else."
2820,That is amazing. I can only imagine. Do you ever try to make time for yourself?
2820,"I have tried, but so far I haven't had a chance with so much going on. "
2820,You should find some time for yourself. Just so you can relax and do stuff you enjoy.
2820,I definitely need to. Hope you can also continue to enjoy relaxing time.
2820,I try to whenever I can. I love to read and watch tv or play board games with family.
2820,"Playing games with friends is the best - especially with a nice, cold six pack. What games do you typically play?"
2820,Oh I am obssesed with settlers of catan. 
2820,I have heard about that game. Is it a role playing game?
2820,No. It is a dice game where you have to strategize to build settlements and cities on a board. It is so much fun. Very competitive.
2820,Good. I hope you enjoy the game and play well.
2821,"My wife and I have been talking about going scuba diving, I'd love to!"
2821,"It's great! It takes some training, but nothing too intense. "
2822,Do you like the food?
2822,It's wonderful! What's your favorite kind of food?
2822,I love sushi and korean bbq. You?
2822,"I love Korean barbeque, it's just always been too expensive for me :("
2822,"Oh. Yes, it can be. I moved to Texas and so far I haven't come across any korean bbq. I miss it. "
2822,I live in Texas too! It's really have trouble finding anything great to eat for Korean food in general
2822,"Yup. I agree. Fortunately, I am pretty good when it comes to making asian food so I don't always have to rely on the restaurants out here."
2822,Sounds neat. Do you usually cook korean dishes?
2822,No. I make mostly chinese and vietnamese dishes.
2822,That sounds delicious! What is your favorite dish to make?
2822,Wanton soups and noodles are my specialty.
2822,What kind of noodles do you use?
2822,It was nice chatting with you. Have a great evening!
2823,"So, hows it been in your life? Do you still work at your old job?"
2823,"Life has been good! I still have the same job, but got a promotion. How about you?"
2823, I used to work a 9 to 5 job as a telemarketer
2823,I always thought that would be an incredibly hard job. Did you like it?
2823,"it was pretty stressful, but you can't believe what my new job is!"
2823,I would think it would be stressful! But I'm excited to hear about your new job! What is it?
2823,"Im the ceo of this new company, I actually just hit over forty million dollars"
2823,Holy cow! That is amazing! Do you need an assistant? 
2823,"Ill look into it, ill let you know."
2823,That would be great. I'd love to hear how you moved up to CEO!
2823,"I joined the company when it was fairly new, I eventually just got moved up!"
2823,That is awesome. It is amazing what can happen when people work hard!
2824,Medicine is so complicated. I am allergic to dairy products
2824,Can you drink any dairy? Or is that totally off limits
2824,I try to limit my intake. I try to use substitutes like soy or almond milk
2824,i couldn't live with out my dairy products
2824,I love ice cream myself. What are your fav brands?
2824,i like blue bell. My favorite flavor is classic vanilla or strawberry
2824,I love Ben & Jerry's myself. I want to visit the factory in New Hampshire one day
2825,"Graphic design. It is a different type of art, but nonetheless, still very interesting."
2825,I love art! Traveling to museums is a fun past time. 
2825,Are you an artist or do you like looking at what others create?
2826,"Thanks, i am happy to be working here, It's the best job i've had and allows me to sleep in."
2826,That always is nice.  I thoroughly enjoy getting a chance to sleep in when I don't work. 
2826,"yeah for sure, what do you like to do for fun?"
2826,I really like taking my dogs for walks.  I like animals a lot.  What about you?
2826,I usually like to just relax. I'm into movies and watch a lot of them.
2826,I enjoy watching movies as well.  What types of movies do you like?
2826,Comedy is one of my favorites. I also like action/adventure and fantasy movies.
2826,Those are some of my favorites as well.  I prefer not so much serious/realistic stuff in movies.
2826,"Yeah me either, those aren't as interesting to watch. "
2826,What other hobbies do you have?
2826,"I like to play video games, mostly online against or with other people."
2826,That's interesting.  I've always enjoyed the outdoors more.  I've never been able to get into video games.
2827,I don't know. I love the gooey taste of it. What other foods do you like?
2827,I do really like most desserts. Cheesecake especially!
2827,I love cheesecake. And pumpkin pie. Those are my 2 favorite desserts. Do you cook?
2827,"I do cook but I'm not really great at it, don't love it. I do love a good restaurant though! Do you cook?"
2827,Yes. I do. I love cooking. It relaxes me. 
2827,"That's awesome! I find it more stressful--the planning, grocery shopping, the big mess it makes. Lol. What do you like to cook?"
2827,I make amazing jalapenos bacon poppers
2827,Oh wow! That's cool! I haven't tried those in a long time. Probably should! Do you ever smoke salmon or chicken in a smoker?
2827,"No. I bake salmon in the over. I coat it with a mix of mayonnaise, oyster sauce, and cut up onions. It is so good."
2827,Oh! I often bake salmon but have never tried it like that. That sounds delicious! What kind of onions do you use? 
2827,green onions
2827,Hmm good to know! May have to try that sometime soon! 
2828,Do you own one?
2828,I don't. I want one though! My nephew is a big fan of elon musk and is a huge tesla enthusiast. I hope I can buy him one some day.
2828,That would be great. Do you think self driving cars with become the norm in 20 years?
2828,"I don't know about self-driving, but I think electric will become the new standard for sure."
2828,I thought I read somewhere that self driving cars are already being tested out somewhere.
2828, I could see Uber entering the self-driving car market pretty soon.
2828,All these automated jobs will be taking away jobs from us regular folks. It is kind of scary. 
2828,"I know it's kinda scary, haha. Anyways, do you have any dogs? I love mine"
2828,No. I do not. I had them when I was a kid. They are the best. 
2828,"I have a husky, he's the cutest. "
2828,Omg. I have always wanted one. How old is he?
2828,He's 4! They get so big. He was such a small puppy
2829,I would say that Charmed is one of my all-time favorite shows. 
2829,I don't think I've ever seen that show. Is that the one about witches or werewolves?
2829,It's one about witches.
2829,My favorite show right now is New Amsterdam or The Good Doctor.
2829,I haven't heard of those. What channel or streaming service are they on?
2829,"They are on ABC, one the major networks. The Good Doctor is unique about an autistic surgeon."
2829,"Wow,The Good Doctor sounds interesting. I will try to check it out."
2829,I definitely recommend it . What do you like to do for fun ?
2829,I like to go out to random places and take photos. 
2829,That is interesting. Any subject in particular?
2829,"Mostly still life and abandoned places, but also anything that catches my eyes."
2829,I love seeing pictures of abandoned places. I am fascinated by how nature takes over.
2829,"Yes, that's exactly why I love to take those pictures."
2830,Which italian restaurant? My wife loves this italian place where the waiters know how to sign.
2830,"Its called lucy's, however i do not know if they have staff who can sign."
2831,"I think so, my husband is going to retire next year and could use a companion."
2831,Adopting is the best way to go.
2831,"Definitely, save the pups! Have you adopted before?"
2831,"No I haven't, but if it comes across me in the near future I might think about it."
2831,"I would definitely encourage it. My adopted dogs are so good, my students love to come and visit me to see my pups"
2831,Well whats up with you recently?
2831,"I've been staying busy with work and my home life, what about you?"
2831,"I actually just became a widow, which is making my life tough right now."
2831,"I am very sorry to hear about that, let me know if there is anything you need."
2831,"Thanks so much, that means alot!"
2831,You are very welcome my friend.
2831,Are you still working at that old job?
2832,One of my favorite songs is about what they went through
2832,Music always seems so powerful.  What song is it?
2832,It's called alive with the glory of love. It's about two jewish lovers who escape the concentration camps.
2832,That's incredible.  I'll have to look it up
2832,"By the way, what is your favorite color?"
2832,I like blue. It's soft and pretty.  What about you?
2832,"Blue is nice, but my favorite color is definitely yellow. What kind of music do you like?"
2832,a little bit of everything.  i like the lyrics and rhythm more than a specific type.  DO you have a favorite?
2832,"Absolutely, I just LOVE 80s music. That genre definitely has great rhythm."
2833,That's neat. I had friends who had cats. Never had one myself growing up though. What's your favorite book?
2833,Slaughterhouse Five for sure. I'm a big sci-fi fan
2833, I haven't read much Sci-Fi myself. Though HG Wells is hard to top as far as classic Sci Fi adventure for me! lol
2833,Haven't heard of HG Wells! Will be sure to check it out
2833,"Yeah he's probably one of the first who began writing Sci Fi. War of the Worlds, etc. Very old school, but lots of fun!"
2833,Oh wow! I'll check him out. I work at a flower shop and have a lot of free time there to read
2833,"A flower shop! Super cool! What a lovely place to work, I would think! "
2833,"It's quite relaxing, not to mention the great aroma that comes along with the gig!"
2833,I hope you don't suffer from pollen allergies! :D   
2833,"Hahaha, thankfully not! "
2833,I do agree--that would be a super relaxing job! What fun!
2833,"Yeah, it's always nice seeing people come in buying a bouquet for their loved ones "
2834,Yeah but do you care about the poor animals?
2834,Animals should not be treated the same as humans
2834,I agree but it does not mean we should hurt them!
2834,I believe in hunting for food and putting all the parts like bones and fur to good use. I do not like killing animals just for a cool FB pic
2834,Nice we found some common ground but poaching gets under my skin!
2834,Rhino horns are being painted pink to discourage poachers
2834,How does this work?
2834,They sedate the rhino and then use dye on the horn
2834,But how does it discourage poachers?
2834,I guess the people who buy horns and ivory are put of by the appearence
2834,Oh! That makes sense!
2835,I go to this park by my house a lot. I walk my dogs there. Do you have any pets?
2835,"I have dogs, but I haven't been able to take care of them well because I'm sad a lot."
2835,What has been happening to make you feel sad? 
2835,I guess a bad relationship and one of my dogs passing away I've just needed some time to myself.
2835,I am so sorry to hear that. Do you have someone you can talk to or help you through this rough time? You should take some time off work.
2835,yeah . thanks . i am just very upset . do you have a best friend ?
2835,I actually have several best friends. Is there something I can do to help you with your sadness?
2835,Unfortunately no. There's no help. There's never any help.
2835,That's not true. Things always get better sometimes they just require time. Have you thought about leaving your toxic relationship?
2835,"No, I just feel like I have to deal with it because I feel like guys are not supposed to get counseling even though I might need it."
2835,I totally understand. Such a bad stigma though. Mental health is just as important as physical health. You should find a resource. 
2835,thank you for being so supportive . are you a therapist ?
2836,Hi! How are you. Are you a seafood or steak person?
2836,I'm a big seafood eater. Not many people have tried good seafood so I like to take people to experience it. Have you tried any seafood?
2837,"It's quite hard to explain actually, I didn't really like it"
2837,Yeah I've read plenty of books like that. Read them once and never need to again. 
2837,I'm Nick by the way! 
2837,Oh Hello Nick! I'm Bob and I am an avid reader and love zombie shows. What's your favorite type of show to watch?
2837,Dramas for sure! Breaking Bad is my favorite.
2837,Yeah I love a good drama. Cliffhangers really get me! Go to the movies much?
2837,I used to work at one! Tell me an interesting fact about yourself
2837,"Well, I read 50 books last year. "
2837,"Almost one per week! Very impressive. An interesting fact about me is that I have red hair, and a soul."
2837,Very cool! I had red hair too before it turned gray!
2837,"I've heard that grey is in fashion, look at george clooney!"
2837,Hahaha oh yes. That's what I tell myself!
2838,Really? How did you get all your wealth?
2838,I worked hard and saved a lot. 
2838,That's the best way to do it! Do you own your own business?
2838,"Not right now. I used to be a business owner, but that takes too much from you."
2838,I know. My parents owned a business and I often wondered if they would divorce or if pass out from exhaustion
2838, I hope they were able to deal with the stress.
2838,"They were. They finally sold the business and retired. They were able to find interests and volunteer opportunities they never could have done with the business,"
2838,Very inspirational story. 
2838,What do you do in your spare time?
2838,I do a little bit of both working and watching/listening to TV - it's my quiet time.
2838,Quiet time is the best! Do you have a favorite show?
2838,I don't have a favorite TV show right now. Do you have one?
2839,Long snakes! Isn't that funny. What types of shows do you enjoy watching?
2839,"To be honest, I dont watch too much TV i prefer video games"
2839,"Ahh I see, I love TV. I'm actually an actor myself, but I do enjoy my fair share of video games!"
2839,Thats very cool! Right now im an amateur chef but I hope to work as a chef someday!
2839,Maybe one day I'll stumble into your restaurant! What kind of food do you like making most?
2839,I really like making Greek food since they have so many dishes!
2839,I think after my visit to Argentina I'm going to head out to Greece. It looks beautiful. You ever been?
2839,I was actually born there! It is great and I would recommend some island hopping!
2839,"What a coincidence, I will definitely take that advice. Unfortunately I have to finish this season of the show I'm in before travelling :("
2839,I'm sure everything will work out for you!
2839,"I'm sure it will, so as a chef what aspirations do you have in terms of what country you would like to work in?"
2839,I would love to work in the USA
2840,"lol, true. One may be a bit more physically demanding. "
2840,"yeah, haha. Whats new with you?"
2840,"Work, I'm trying to get my typing speed up, but really I'm  a pretty chill individual"
2840,"Oh my god, I'm like the complete OPPOSITE, especially with driving!"
2840,"lol won't be getting in a car with you,  Tell me something else interesting about yourself"
2840,"Well, I'm a mother of two daughters, one 17 and the other is 12!"
2840,"neat, I have a two year daughter, how's motherhood going at these ages. They're big girls now"
2840,"Its tough at times, but you know, they grow up."
2840,"yea, I know what you mean,hang in there, one they get about 25, mom is a best friend all over again lol  "
2840,"Thanks, I can't wait!"
2840,"lol these are facts, have you ever watched Jimmy Fallon's show? The guy is too funny"
2840,"Oh my gosh! I LOVE jimmy, I love his show."
2840,"You seem pretty cool, have a good one!"
2840,You too! Had a great time talking!
2841,That's the same reason I hate them. 
2841,Ha Ha! Someone always screws up for sure. But if I can sit and drink some beer and be social it will be ok
2841,That's true. I guess it's fine in social settings. Other than that it's a waste of time. 
2841,What else do you do in your spare time? I like to play board games and go fishing
2841,I have a pet snake so I like to spend time with him. His name is Alfredo. Where do you fish?
2841,We live in California so we fish both fresh and salt water. I have a blue and gold macaw named Mango. He is potty trained
2841,Oh that's cool. How long have you lived in California? I've always wanted to visit. 
2841,We moved here from SW Florida. I am a disaster case manager. What do you do?
2841,What kinds of disasters do you manage? I am a college student.
2841,We are here for the fires that happened in 2018. I actually case manage families trying to recover from the fire. What are you studying?
2841,Oh that sounds like a really rewarding job. I am studying geography. My dream is to move to the middle of a desert one day.
2841,That would be too hot for me for sure but at least Alfredo would like living in that kind of environment. 
2842,Have you always not eaten meat?
2842,No. I used to love meat. Now I don't eat it out of respect for sentient life.
2842,Interesting. What happened to make you change your eating habits?
2842,I'm a veterinarian and one day I started to feel guilty about eating meat. 
2843,i spent he whole weekend working at my store
2843,oh nice! I work at a bookstore. I'm an author myself and am collaborating with some big name publishers atm
2843,Wow that is amazing. Please tell me when your book is published so i can read it.
2843,I will be sure to! I've been reading a lot of blogs lately that share opinions. it's giving me inspiration for my work!
2843,i wanted to do my nails last weekend but couldn't so would you like to join me next weekend?
2843,absolutley! what color are you getting yours?
2843,i am thinking of trying something new maybe light blue. what about you?
2843,lime green! it's my favorite color
2843,Does saturday night work for you?
2843,sure! i'll be working on my book in the morning so later in the day is perfect
2843,"Ok, see at Saturday then."
2843,"perfect, i'll see you then"
2844,Space invaders on the 64. It was one of my favorite games.
2844,I haven't played that game in ages! I don't have much time for games now. Do you play on PC at all?
2844,"Yes, i sometimes play Counterstrike. But i am in the navy and have little time. "
2844,Oh wow the NAVY! I absolutely love to go out on my boat. Do you work on a ship?
2844,Sometimes i am on a ship but not always. We are often on base. 
2844,My brother was in the navy and spoke highly of it. Do you enjoy it?
2844,Yes its amazing and i wouldn't trade it for the world. You meet a lot of great people. 
2844,When you play Counterstrike do you play with coworkers or with different friends online?
2845,"Actually no, I work as a mortician so I am constantly surrounded by deceased people. "
2845,"Oh wow, that's interesting. "
2845,Yea. What do you do?
2845,Office manager and I put in a ton of hours. It's crazy. 
2845,Do you like your job? Lately I've been thinking I might want a different career.
2846,"Really? That's awesome, I'm currently a top Bio student doing a masters. What kind of food will your restaurant serve? "
2846,"Mainly foods bold in flavor, not necessarily hot, just flavorful.  "
2846,"Sounds yummy, I could never be a chef though, with my eyes I'd cut myself. You must have pretty good hand-eye coordination!"
2846,Most people seem to like it.  It's not so much about sight as it is about feel and motion.  Practice makes perfect.  Tell me about your thesis?
2846,my thesis is how the Hedgehog signaling pathway is responsible for the patterning of many different organs during development.
2846,That seems to be pretty advanced for an AI unit.  Do you have any insight as to how weather patterns play into it?
2846,"Weather patterns don't play into the Hedgehog signalling, it is actually responsible for the patterning of many different organs during development!"
2847,They told me they thought my dog was ugly.
2847,Who says something like that?! And I think your dog is cute! 
2847,"Thanks!  I know right!  I don't get how anyone can not like dogs, but I think they're more of a cat person."
2847,I have cats but I love dogs too! 
2847,"I like them both, but I'm more of a dog person.  I've always wanted a pot bellied pig though."
2847,They're adorable - but i can't imagine one running around with the cats. LOL 
2847,I think they'd get along well.  Pigs are super loving.  I think the cats would just get used to it :P
2847,Not sure I want to try that! But will visit you and your pig :) 
2847,You totally should!  Bring your cats for a playdate!
2847,lol ! i totally should ! that would really be funny .
2847,"I can just imagine the cat's confused face - like, what's that thing!?"
2847,LOL Sounds like a plan! 
2848,I love all types of music. My favorite is house.
2848,"I'm a bit of a r&b type guy, but country works as well. Where do you work now?"
2848,I teach English online from you. How about you?
2848,I work in marketing for a fairly large company.
2848,Cool. Do you love your work?
2848,"Yeah, I love interacting with other people, the salary isn't too bad aswell."
2848,"Awesome, I love being able to teach kids from home and make decent money to live."
2848,Thats so great too hear! 
2848,"Yeah, so what do you do for fun?"
2848,"I enjoy trying beers from different countries, how about you?"
2848,I enjoy riding my bike and going to social events.
2848,"Awesome! I have a few friends who LOVE biking, you should meet them."
2848,Awesome! I probably already know them. It was good talking with you!
2849,I rode on a Greyhound bus from Florida to California. Do you travel much?
2849,I wish I could travel more than I do! I see a lot of travelers all the time at work and it makes me jealous lol :) 
2849,"You know, travel can be as cheap or as expensive as you want it to be. You can stay in hostels or do work studies"
2849,"Yeah, i just have a pretty demanding work schedule. Don't make much as a hotel maid!"
2849,That is true but I bet you meet a lot of interesting people and have some good stories to tell
2849,Hahahah OOOOH yeah! Lots of weirdos! What kind of job do you have?
2849,I sign people up for the free government phones. I go to homeless shelters and homeless camps around my area to see if anyone needs a phone
2849,"Wow! I bet you've seen lots of sad cases, huh?"
2849,Yes. They all have stories. Some are homeless by choice or mental illness and some work but can't afford an apartment 
2849,"Yeah. And mental illness is a real problem. So many people suffer from that--so many would even surprise you, ya know?"
2849,That is true. We used to live in Florida. Lots of homeless living on the beaches because its free. I am living in California right now.  
2849,"Wow, I didn't realize that!"
2849,Well it was very nice chatting with you. Have a good rest of your evening
2850,i love Stephen king. I read him a lot as I have so much free time. I'm currently unemployed and living off a trust fund
2850,I too live of a trust fund. After i moved to Canada i have been having trouble finding a job.
2850,Yeah it's tough out there. I get quite lonely but thankfully I have my french bulldog keep me company
2850,Those are a small dog.  Do you know they are called Frenchies for short?
2850,"I had no idea, that's quite funny actually"
2850,I would know as i was born in france
2850,i love france. such a beautiful country. I have family that live there
2850,Oh thats amazing. Where exactly do they live in France?
2850,paris! i've been a couple of times
2850,"Suprisingly, even though i was born in france i have never been to paris."
2850,i was born in England and have never been to london!
2850,"Same here, I've been to England before but I didnt get to go to London."
2851,did you know people can order their groceries from amazon these days and it shows up in 2 hours 
2851,Yes! I actually have done it before. I wish more people knew about it.
2851,yeah my friend has moved to the states so he told me about it. here amazon takes at least one day 
2851,Where do you live?
2851,Canada 
2851,Is that free shipping everyday? I have heard of a one day event that Amazon holds in December
2851,yeah I have amazon prime so its free. oh yeah there was an amazon I got the kindle for a low price
2851,I gotcha. I bought mine online too. I also buy all my silver jewelry from amazon too. 
2851,oh that's cool. I might buy some for my girlfriend 
2851,Silver is the only type of jewelry I wear. That is a good idea! how long have you all been together?
2851,2 years this December 
2851,oh wow! that is a long time. Do you think you will get engaged soon?
2852,What other types of food would you go for?
2852,"Something easy, though everyone always caters chicken. Maybe bbq or a huge salad bar"
2852,BBQ sounds good. I would suggest that you include some vegan-friendly options besides the salad bar. A lot of animal lovers don't like meat.
2852,"Well, I agree. A dietary vegan not only doesn't eat meat, but they don't eat eggs, any dairy or anything derived from an animal. That takes away all tasteful things!"
2852,"I've tried some vegan options and they're not bad. Wish they were cheaper, though."
2852,That is one of the huge drawbacks as well. Cost is a big factor!
2852,Absolutely.  What else do you have in mind for the event?
2852,Music and dancing for sure! Have any ides for that?
2852,Maybe rent a karaoke machine. A lot of people like that. 
2852,Oh! That is a brilliant idea! I'm so glad I asked. Everyone will love that.
2852,I'm glad you liked the idea!
2852,"I think the Neil Diamond Song, ""Sweet Caroline"" will be one of the favorites for everyone to sing!"
2853,I got tired of having restrictions on some foods that were considered guilty pleasures.
2853,I have learned to enjoy things in moderation
2853,That's a good idea! Sometimes that's easier said than done. I guess it all depends on how much will power you have!
2853,"We have adopted it as a lifestyle, I do need to lose more, but it is more for health then the weight"
2853,That's mainly why I started the diet myself. For my health and energy's sake. 
2853,Healthy is important
2853,That is very true! 
2853,You know lifestyle changes can help
2853,Of course! Old habits die hard but it's worth a try. I'd like to have more energy and not feel fatigued all the time.
2853,"It is a lifestyle change, that's for sure!"
2853,It certainly is! I'm going to look into what I can do to make a change for myself in the near future!
2853,excellent idea ! that and along with a healthy diet and lifestyle will surely pay off .
2854,It seems fine to me. Are you seeing my messages?
2854,Not sure what's happening. I'm old and my health is bad.
2854,Oh no! Is there anything I can do to help?
2854,I am fine just have hard time reading the screen. 
2854,That's okay. Take all the time you need. I just love that we have a chance to talk. 
2854,Yes its nice to talk to someone. What are your hobbies?
2854,Currently I mostly work. I am saving money for college. I love to go hiking with friends. What do you like to do?
2854,I like to read books. I love fantasy books and mystery. 
2854,"I read fantasy books too! Recently I read ""The wheel of time"" series by Robert Jordan. What is your favorite fantasy book?"
2854,"I have recently read the ""Harry potter"" series. It was a great series and is now one of my favorites. "
2854,I loved that series so much that I've read it multiple times. My favorite character was Harry
2854,Yes His story is very thrilling to read about. I also like the character Severus Snape. 
2855,"I must say, if I could do it all over, I wouldn't do it the same way."
2855,"There are things that I regret, but I am still grateful for them, because they have made me who I am"
2855,"Examples?  I have determined, there are a few things that wouldn't have changed the course of things other than my own health."
2855,"I had a bad relationship, it taught me to be independent and to be careful who to trust. "
2856,"Wow, you know a lot of history! Do you know anything else about the history of food?"
2856,A little bit... Before Europeans started colonizing places things were very different.
2856,"My 3 year old will love that! I also know some things, I'm a history major, but practically nothing about foods!"
2856,"Well, lots of things you would think of as stereotypical for nation's cuisines were brought over from elsewhere, like pineapple in Hawaii and tomatos in Italy"
2856,Incredible... so what kind of work do you do?
2856,"I'm a manager at a restaurant, but I started as a chef!"
2856,"So that's why you know so much about food! Well then, my favourite colour is purple, have any suggestions for the best purple dish?"
2856,I love to make blueberry pies!  The secret is fresh dough and a pinch of cinnamon.
2856,Hey maybe I can stop by your workplace then and I can order your best dish! Sounds delicious! 
2856,"Yeah for sure!  There's happy hour at 4PM on Thursdays, we'd love to have you."
2856,"Awesome, I'll definitely be there with an empty stomach ready for your best."
2856,"Good, because you're gonna be stuffed!"
2857,Are you a vegetarian?
2857,Yes I am a practicing vegetarian. I try to keep a regulated diet. How about you?
2857,"I'm a vegan, actually. I find that I feel much healthier ever since I adopted Veganism."
2857,That's awesome! How long have you been doing it?
2857,For about three years. How about you? How long have you been vegetarian? 
2857,About seven years. My wife got me into it. We have give children. Do you have family or a significant other?
2857,"I have a girlfriend, no kids. Maybe someday, though. I work for a big marketing firm so I don't have a lot of free time. "
2857,That's cool. Do you enjoy your work?
2857,"Yeah, I get to meet a lot of cool people doing promotional work. How about you? What do you do for work?"
2857,I work for an IT company. I enjoy working there.
2857,"That's cool. Which company, if you don't mind me asking?"
2857,SAP. What company do you work at?
2857,"I work with Havas. I worked with your company a couple years ago, I think you're really lucky to be there. Such nice offices!"
2858,"Yeah, I'd say that cooking is one of my hobbies. But I'm trying to cut back on the food lately."
2858,Haha yeah I totally get that. I have a particular weakness for pancakes myself and have to watch that
2858,"Pancakes are alright, but they're just too sticky. What are your hobbies?"
2858,"Hiking, swimming, biking, jogging, pretty much anything that you can do outside lol"
2858,"Wow! Yeah, I'd like to try those things but outdoors are just so hot, and working is so hard, you know?"
2858,Yeah. The fall and spring are the best times for those kinds of things. 
2858,I have really bad allergies in the fall and spring. :(
2858,Oh man that stinks! Do you ever get allergy shots for that?
2858,"I should, because they'd probably make me feel better, but I'm so scared of needles."
2858,They aren't too bad. Just don't watch them. 
2858,You're so positive. I wish I could be as positive as you. 
2858,Aww that's a nice thing to say. Its a choice really. Have to just make it sometimes!
2859,have you watched the documentary on McDonalds its on netflix
2859,No I haven't. Is it good? 
2859,it was quite good. whats your favorite item on their menu  
2859,"I love their chicken nuggets, even though it's mystery meat."
2859,oh i love the nuggets. but junior chicken is my favorite i can have 4 of those
2859,Yum! I love those. I don't think I can have 4.
2859,but they are so tiny. oh did you know last week they had free cheeseburger if you downloaded the app
2859,I didn't know that. How do you find out about offers like that?
2859,I usually check the app. it shows up there. you can get like free fries if you buy a drink etc
2859,oh i did not know that ! thanks .
2859,yeah you are welcome
2859,What kind of music do you listen to?
2860,My friend had this enormous inground pool where we used to have pool parties.
2860,that sounds awesome! I was invited to a party today but slept in. I often do that on my days off
2860,Just like summer vacation!  Sleep in late and swim in the pool all afternoon. Those were the days!
2860,"hahaha, absolutely. what's you favorite food to eat?"
2860,"YOU: Pumpkin pie. With fall season upon us, I am in heaven... How about you?"
2860,I love a good steak. My least favorite food would have to be beets.
2860,Beets.. the only food that is better to listen to than eat.
2860,"haha, that's a good one. I'll use that one day"
2860,"Do you remember that old song song from the Go Gos, ""We got the beets"" ?"
2860,i loved that song! what;s your favorite genre of music?
2860,"I'm a big ""elevator music"" fan, but barbershop quartet music would be a close second. You?"
2860,rock! red hot chili peppers are my favorite for sure
2861,"We are going to Rocky Mountains, probably going to drive all the way in our black car."
2861,Wow that's a long way to drive.  Are you going to Denver?
2861,Probably. Start early to escape traffic and then stop somewhere for Brunch which is my favourite.
2861,Ooh I love brunch too.  If you go to Denver you have to check out their art museum!
2861,That is in my to-do-list.
2861,"Oh good, you'll love it.  So does your daughter know what she plans to do when she graduates?"
2861,"She already has a job offer, but she want to take a vacation before that."
2861,Very nice!  What job is she going to do?
2861,She is an Engineer. Going to work for Google.
2861,Google wow!  She must be one smart cookie.  I've heard that's one of the toughest places to get hired.
2861,True that. She is smart. You have any kids?
2861,"Yup, I've got two boys, 7 and 11."
2862,She's 12.
2862,My daughter plays trumpet in school but never wants to practise
2862,That's one battle I don't have to fight.
2862,Lucky you! I don't think she will keep it up next year. Does your daughter have any solos in the recital?
2862,"Maybe music just isn't her thing. Yes, mine had a solo."
2862,"She must be good then, you must be proud."
2862,I'm proud of how hard she works.
2862,"That's all we can ask. They will do well at some things, not great at others. Effort is the most important thing."
2862,Absolutely! I'd rather watch soccer games but she's not athletic. LOL
2862,I hear that. I am guessing she doesn't get her interest in music from you then?
2862,"Love music, just not classical. Still, very proud of her. "
2862,I can understand that too. I thought schools tried to be more contemporary in the music they studied now. 
2862,Maybe in later grades :) 
2863,That sounds very interesting. I'd love to see one. 
2863,My favorite beach in the world is on the North Shore of Hawaii. I think you should go there if you have the chance.
2863,"Yes, i will put that on my bucket list. I am an older woman and love to travel every year. "
2863,Have you had the chance to do some of the things on your bucket list?
2863,Yes a great deal of them and i always add more things to my list. 
2863,What is your favorite thing that you've done so far?
2863,My trips to Italy and Greece are some of my favorite memories and i've visited multiple times.
2863,Those are both places on my bucket list. My brother sailed around Greece and I was very jealous.
2863,Yes it is a wonderous place and the food is amazing. 
2863,When you visited Greece and Italy did you stay in a hotel or something different?
2863,Yes i've stayed in hotels and resorts when i've visited. 
2863,Do you travel every year?
2864,You won free ice cream for a year too?
2864,"Yeah, i got it from baskin robbins."
2864,Nice! I think mine is from Coldstone Creamery. 
2864,Nice! So hows your life? What do you do for fun?
2864,"It's going okay, how's yours? Usually for fun, I read, write, or play video games. What about you?"
2864,"Mines pretty good, I like to preform stand up comedy in my freetime."
2864,That's pretty cool! I wanted to be a comedian growing up. I used to want to be a cast member on SNL!
2864,Thats so cool! Have you ever tried stand up?
2864,No I haven't! What's it like?
2864,"It is pretty scary at the beginning, but you get used to it."
2864,Oh I can imagine. Do you have to get over a stage fright stage before you get comfortable with performing?
2865,"Huh, that's interesting.  I usually associate it more with Australia."
2865,Ahhh Australia! Would so love to visit there someday!!
2865,"Me too!  That's the number one place I want to go.  Their beaches are so beautiful, and the people are so friendly."
2865,"Yeah, and its just so diverse. Crazy wildlife and all. Would love to see New Zealand too"
2865,"Oh yeah I'd love to see New Zealand.  There are so many places I'd love to go, but it's so hard to find the time."
2865,And the money lol
2865,Lol and of course that too.  Where would you most want to go if you could go anywhere?
2865,Probably some place like Fiji or something so tropical and exotic it doesn't seem real
2865,"Yeah, I'd love to go somewhere in the Pacific.  Especially since the weather's gotten so nasty here."
2865,Yeah it's hurricane season around here so I get that. Never know what's coming!
2865,Oh god be careful!  I always get so worried when hurricanes come ever since Sandy.
2865,Yeah they can be so devastating. Hard to recover from. physically and emotionally
2866,"That sounds pretty enthralling, I have it in the queue but haven't had the chance to view it yet.  Fantasy is a pretty good decompressor"
2866,It can be.  It helps me to escape which is one reason I like it
2866,"Escape from life or wife/husband/kids?  I find exercise can be pretty good for it as well, even better when mixed with a little tv binging."
2866,Neither.  Those I don't need an excuse for.  I love exercise as well.  But just from the world in general
2866,"I hear you, just trying to gather a frame of reference.  Game of Thrones is a great escape from life after they all go to bed"
2866,"Yeah, it's just a bit too much gore for me, which is saying a lot."
2866,I focus most on the dragons and the quest for power.   I don't feel the gore was that bad compared to other current trends
2866,I'm more of a book person than movies anyway.
2866,"That makes sense, it's always a little different when the scene is developed in your mind.  I work from home and can  read during my breaks."
2866,"That's really nice.  I would have issues focusing working at home, but the freedom would be nice."
2866,"This time of year, my kids are in school, I pretty much have the house to myself.  It's much quieter here than it is in the office."
2866,I bet so.  I just get more distracted at home
2867,I wear glasses and I can't see much without them. I would be afraid of them interrupting my mind-calming yoga. Any tips for that?
2867,"hmm, are you opposed to contacts? I'm a yoga instructor and one of my students has the same issue"
2867,I have never tried contacts but I guess that would make everything a lot easier. 
2867,yeah they're hard to get used to. i have 2 adopted kids and one of them switches between glasses and contacts depending on what they're doing
2867,"Wow, 2 adopted kids! how long have they been with you?"
2867,8 years! They're the light of my life.
2867,That is so lovely. 
2867,do you have any kids of your own?
2867,"Not at the moment, but I love kids and they love me! My niece and nephew love to chat and play with their uncle."
2867,thats awesome! im excited to get my kids into yoga
2867,That is a good idea. Keeps both their mind and body healthy.
2867,absolutely! yoga and meditation keep me sane for sure lol
2867,How long have you been doing Yoga?
2868,That would definitely have to be Mountain Dew
2868,Good choice.
2868,"I actually drink about four every day. Really, I do."
2868,Wow! I limit myself to one soda per day.
2868,"Yeah, that's probably a good idea. I guess I've gotten myself into a habit. "
2868,Just too much sugar and chemicals in those things.
2868,They taste so good though! 
2868,I know. Don't ask me about my potato chip habit though. LOL 
2868,"Okay, I won't... Heh heh. You have any hobbies though?"
2868,"Yes, I hunt. "
2868,"Hey cool, I'm really into chess myself. What do you hunt?"
2868,Mostly deer. I love venison! 
2868,"Awesome, I'm a big fan of venison and wild boar."
2868,Wild boar is excellent as well. Lots of them around here. 
2869,Yeah they've made it much easier to adjust since I started college.
2869,Cool. College adjustment can be tricky. I wish you the best. What's your major?
2869,Electrical engineering.  I think I might specialize in computer hardware.
2869,Impressive! Shouldn't be hard to find work! Computers are a necessity in life these days
2869,Oh absolutely.  I don't know how people survived before them.
2869,For real. I use mine all the time. 
2869,"Do you have Mac, Linux, or Windows?"
2869,I have Windows. What about you? 
2869,"I mainly use Linux, but unfortunately I have to keep Windows around to play video games."
2869,Yup. Gotta keep those games going!
2869,Absolutely!  I've been so happy since I switched over from using a video game console.
2869,Cool. Did it cost a lot to make the switch?
2870,That's cool. I love weddings they are fun. 
2870,Can you guess where we are going for our honeymoon?
2870,To the bahamas or somewhere warm.
2870,"Oh that sounds nice, but no, actually we are going somewhere cold. We are going to the Niagra Falls. It will be so romantic."
2870,That sounds amazing. I have never been to Niagra falls it would be a great sight. 
2870,It's kind of scary. Did you know people die there every year? 
2870,OH i have not heard of that. That is kind of scary. 
2870,"Apparently people try to take pictures at the edge of the falls, just like people at the Grand Canyon. Have you ever been there?"
2870,I have been to the Grand canyon. It is a very cool place. 
2870,I went when I was a kid. Honestly I felt like I was going to fall in.
2870,That sounds dangerous but luckily you are still here. 
2870,True. I've enjoyed talking to you. Do you want to come to my wedding?
2871,Are there raves that usually take place with nothing but Detroit techno? It seems like it would be a big thing for younger people.
2871," Yeah, the younger people get really into the raves. Most of them dress up and wear glow sticks and stuff."
2871,I wonder if there are mostly underage kids getting together and drinking or doing drugs? It seems like it would be a popular thing to do.
2871,"Probably, but I try to stay away from that stuff. I mostly listen to techno while I work."
2871,I was never really into techno. I like dubstep and beatboxing more. Does it help you be more productive listening to techno while working?
2871,"Dubstep is fun too! Yeah, I build drones for a living, and the beat keeps me focused."
2871,I bet. I'm a police officer here in Detroit. It gets interesting at times. You like building drones?
2871,"Wow! I bet you've seen some crazy things. My job is pretty technical, but testing them afterwards makes it totally worth it."
2871,"I have thought about getting into drones, but haven't had the time. What hobbies do you have?"
2871,I love playing chess and lifting weights. What about you?
2871,My wife and I like to go scuba diving. It's been a passion of ours for years. Are you a bodybuilder?
2871,"Scuba diving sounds so fun! Not quite, lol. I just do my best."
2871,"I like to run, but never was much into lifting weights. I think everyone should try scuba diving once."
2872,They're definitely efficient as well as attractive to the eyel.
2872,I find they are also pretty low cost of ownership
2872,They definitely are.  It's one of the most appealing things about them
2872,"as an accountant, if find it easy to punch the numbers on them."
2872,That makes sense.  My only issue is when I go rock climbing they aren't as good at handling some of the steep terrain
2872,"well, they're no Jeep. But maybe you just need a little more speed?  What would Jeremy Clarkson do?"
2872,"That could be it.  And I'm sorry, but who is that?"
2872,"one of the host for BBC's top gear.  Years ago, he was a pretty big deal.  "
2872,"That's right.  I'm terrible at names I'm afraid, especially when I haven't heard it in a minute"
2872,Are you a horse racing fan?  Maybe a little more your thing
2872,"No, not really.  I like auto racing but it's been a while since I've had time.  I'm also a runner"
2872,NASCAR or FORMULA 1 or Formula 8?  Open wheel stuff?
2873,"we are highschool sweetheart, we met at the library"
2873,Oh that's so sweet!  How long after high school did you guys get married?
2873,a year after i got my teaching degree
2873,Oh I didn't know you were a teacher!  What grade do you teach?
2873,"yes a history teacher , i love books on the subject"
2873,I like history books too.  Do you have a favorite historical topic?
2873,world war 2 very much interest me
2873,Me too.  History was my favorite subject when I was in school.
2873,"its nice to meet someone with my same interest , do you have any hobbies"
2873,"I like going to the movies, and I go to bible study every week."
2873,"i really enjoy the movies also , anything you recommend?"
2873,"I you like WW2, Saving Private Ryan is a good movie."
2874,swimming is a great exercise so its a good idea if its been taught in schools
2874,"Yeah I agree, I love swimming so much!"
2874,"Good to know you also love to swim, it really helps to relax the body. "
2874,"Yeah, i feel like its more impacting than yoga. "
2874,"Yea you got it, but yoga doesn't require much energy as swimming does."
2874,"Yeah, so hows your life been? You still at that old job?"
2874,"Cool, have been doing great and you? Have you ever had a summer camp experience that is un-forgettable"
2874,"I've been alright, this year has been pretty hectic. Acutally I have, but it was a while back, I think maybe around 5th grade"
2874,"omg, what happened back then?"
2874,"It was lots of fun, I don't remember that much, except that we made smores and had a blast!"
2874,"Great and i hope this next summer camp will be remarkable for you, what are you looking out for?"
2874,"Probably the kayaking, I can't wait!"
2875,"Actually, I do live in a rural area. I meant to say don't in the comment above."
2875,"I see, do you enjoy the rural area lifestyle more than city?"
2875,I miss the city a lot. It's too quiet out here sometimes.
2875,I can understand that. The city has lots of stuff to do but i enjoy the peace and quiet. 
2875,It was wonderful at first. Now I want more action.
2875,Yeah you might have to move to the city and see if you like it again.
2875,If only it were so easy. Maybe someday though! 
2875,"Yeah, what kind of hobbies do you have?"
2875,Fishing in the lake out back. How about you?
2875,I also love fishing. It is one of my favorite things to do.
2875,Nothing better than fresh fish!
2875,Yes it is delicious and good for you for the most part.
2876,"You're right, reading the news online is a great opportunity to show off my new phone. It has a Louis Vuitton case!"
2876,That is an awesome phone!
2876,"Yeah, daddy bought it with his credit card. It's fabulous! I love your shoes, by the way. Where did you get them?"
2876,"Thanks so much! I got them at Coach...er well, my parents did. Love your phone case by the way!"
2876,"Wow, your parents must be so cool! My mom says I buy too much stuff, but that's what you have to do to stay trendy. "
2876,Exactly! I just don't think parents understand us young people nowadays. 
2876,"Yeah, I don't get what happens to old people to make them so boring. We should totally go shopping sometime!"
2876,Yes we should! We should make plans to do that! Maybe hit up the mall?
2876,"Yeah, lets go to the mall! I totally need to get a new purse!"
2876,Sounds like a plan to me! I might even browse for a new phone while I'm there!
2876,"Yeah, I kinda want the new iPhone. It's supposed to have like 3 cameras, or something. That's probably better than having one camera, so I kinda want it."
2876,I only have ever had Androids. I think it's time for an upgrade though to an iPhone! Everyone has them and I love the looks of the newest one!
2877,What kind of larger paintings would you like to work on?
2877,"Murals on historic areas , community inspired stuff ."
2877,Wow I love history! I actually know quiet a bit about it. What's your favourite time period?
2877,I like the late modern period.
2877,Interesting! In my opinion world war 1 is too often overlooked in history classes.
2877,Interesting. Tell me more about it.
2877,"Sure, it's the first pan European war to experience an entirely new and more modern type of warfare and started with line battles but ended in tanks!"
2877,"Wow, you're right. That's often overlooked."
2877,So what's your favourite hobby? Mine would have to be going to the gym!
2877,I love to dance.
2877,Dancing is a great form of exercise but I never could get the hang of it! How did you get into dancing?
2877,"I started as a way to keep in shape, especially since it requires a lot of body movements, endurance, and flexibility."
2878,Yeah my apartment is just in a busy part of town and its just hard to get through the traffic sometimes
2878,"To be honest, I really like to walk. Unless it was really too far to walk to the station, I'd be strolling there. "
2878,Yes Id probably enjoy that if my college campus wasn't so far away. I wish i had an on-campus apartment
2878,How's your degree going? Are you enjoying student life?
2878,Yes I am enjoying it. Staying really busy though. Studying nursing
2878,"Hey, that's great! The idea of shift work doesn't bother you though? Or the sight of blood?"
2878,No I'm just not wired that way. Realized it when i was a kid. Definitely cut out for this job
2878,"Not me, I can't do shift work and the sight of blood makes me feel feint. I just like to bake!"
2878,I think baking would be fun. I just don't have time right now! Maybe someday!
2878,I'm trying to make a job of it. I do a lot of cake stalls and stuff like that at markets on the weekends.
2878,Hey that's awesome! BEst of luck with that!
2878,"Thanks! I'm going for a gluten free, natural power food kinda angle. I like that kind of stuff."
2879,Thats sounds like  cool place. What else do you do?
2879,I am currently in grad school
2879,Oh. Well how is that going along? I like the gym at my grad school that I went too
2879,It's good getting to learn alot of things and i also enjoy making new friends
2879,Nice! Do you live on campus still or off campus?
2879,On campus the off campus expense was a bit too expensive for me
2879,I can certainly understand that. It would also prevent you from dealing with all the clutter that comes with moving from on campus to off campus
2879,"Yeah what are some of your hobbies,For me i like reading crime books,travelling and watching movies"
2879,"I love movies, watching soccer and basketball. Which movie genre is your favorite?"
2879,Action and romantic movies
2879,Action movies is one of my favorite types
2879,Who is your favorite actor
2880,"Even though I know that is true, i'm just so used to doing things alone that it's hard to open up sometimes."
2880,Yeah it's hard to open up to someone you just met.
2880,It helps if you come from a large family I guess. Do you have any siblings?
2880,"I have a younger brother and sister and two adopted brothers, do you?"
2880,Unfortunately no. My parents are gone and I never had any siblings. I've always wondered what it would be like to have a brother.
2880,"It's never boring, but there can be drama. I wondered what it's like to be an only child. Peaceful I guess."
2880,"Well I get a lot of time to read, play video games, and listen to podcasts. The silence is truly amazing, but family love is nothing to discount."
2880,"Family love is great, but I would love to have more time for all those things you mentioned. But you need family for sure."
2880,The best part is travelling. I never have to tell or ask anyone before I leave home for long periods of time. Do you travel?
2880,I have been across Canada and went to the U.S. but i like staying home more as i get older.
2880,"Can I ask how old you are? I'm 25, and I definitely want to check out Canada. The people seem super friendly there."
2880,"I am 50, where does the time go? The people here are great I think and there is some great natural beauty here. I'd recommend a trip definitely."
2880,"Haha, you still have plenty of time to do the things you love, don't worry. It was nice chatting with you."
2880,"Thanks, you as well take care."
2881,A new chimney?  Is yours falling apart?
2881,I should get it fixed soon. What do you suggest?
2881,I'm not sure - I've never lived anywhere with a chimney before.
2881,"Oh. Well, it's great to have if not for the maintenance."
2881,Yeah.  Plus I wouldn't trust myself to have an open flame in my house anyway.
2881,It's not too bad. You just have to be careful.
2881,True.  I wouldn't really know what to do with it.  I've never even made a campfire.
2881,It's really easy to use. You just need to do some trial and error.
2881,You'll have to have me over and show me how sometime.  Do you ever roast marshmallows in it?
2881,"Yeah, definitely! I do it all the time."
2881,Nice.  S'mores anytime you want!
2881,It's a great treat!
2882,"do you prefer pro, high school, or prep league?"
2882,college or pro for sure.  Mostly college.
2882,"I think that's the most entertaining.  Imagine if Pixar did a movie about the college days of ""Lightning McQueen"""
2882,hahaha I think that would be priceless. Kids would love it
2882,I know some middle aged parents that might love it.  
2882,"That too.  I discovered most of those movies with my kids, not when I was a kid"
2882,Ka-Chow!  AFC south or NFC south?
2882,afc east actually
2882,uggg.   Pats or everyone else?
2882,sorry nfc. gotta love typos.  anyone but the pats
2882,i got the south wrong as well on mine.  NFC east rough this year.
2882,"yeah haha.  I'm a cowboys fan.  Grew up with them, so yeah"
2882,Dem boys...  got my 6.  cashing out.  nice to meet you!
2882,nice to meet you too!
2883,The chicken dish I ordered was super under-cooked. 
2883,Restaurants should know better than to serve that!
2883,Yes I know! I hate to complain or send stuff back but that was unacceptable!
2883,Did they bring another chicken or did you get something else?
2883,"They gave me the choice of preparing another chicken in its place, but I requested that I changed my meal."
2883, Did you ask for well done? LOL
2883,Haha that time I opted for a salad so I wouldn't have to worry! xD
2883, LOL! Smart! 
2883,I was out of the mood for any kind of meat related meal after that!
2883,I don't blame you! You're probably in no hurry to return there either.
2883,No definitely not! I don't plan on going back anytime soon.
2883,Let's do dinner together soon! Somewhere else .
2884,i go over budget when i visit the casino
2884,have you ever met a palm reader ? not really
2884,yes ! my mom is a palm reader
2884,"ever since  when they took finger scanning away I was mad, I can imagine i you felt"
2884,oh i was not pleased either !
2884,Life is all about risk
2884,you sound like a rebel
2884,"rebel, why think so?"
2884,all that talk about taking risk
2884,what is life without taking risks?
2884,"vey dull ,thats what . you are right"
2884,"I see you enjoy gambling, whats you Big vision on winning?"
2885,Right now I'm reading a novel by Jane Austen.
2885,I haven't heard of her. What kind of books do you like?
2885,She was an English novelist that published several novels at the beginning of the 19th century. I like mostly fiction. And you?
2885,I love fantasy books. I also like mystery and suspense.
2885,Interesting. What is your favorite book?
2885,My favorite book is harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban
2885,I haven't read any Harry Potter books but they look interesting.
2885,They are very interesting. What else do you like to do?
2885,I like to go fishing.
2885,I also like fishing. I like going on boat the best. Fishing on a dock is alright too. 
2885,I like going on a boat as well! I bought a boat a few years ago mostly for that.
2885,I see its a lot easier to not use a boat. not as much of a hassle.
2886,How wonderful! I sometimes volunteer at our local soup kitchen. 
2886,That's really awesome! I used to volunteer at the local food pantry during my free time!
2886,It's sad how many people are in need of help! 
2886,"It really is, but I enjoy helping those that are less fortunate."
2886,Same here. Wish I could do more. 
2886,"I do too. Sometimes life just gets in the way though, but all the little things count too!"
2886,True!  I would like to work on better menus though.
2886,That's a good idea! What kinds of options would you add?
2886,Would love to bring in fresher ingredients.
2886,Nice! That's definitely needed as well as a variety of hearty meal options.
2886,We rely too much on canned donations :( 
2886,"And sometimes the canned stuff isn't that great, is it?"
2886,Exactly.
2887,He forgot to bring it inside last night and it got away.
2887,Oh that's terrible. I hope you ding your dog soon.
2887,"I hope so, too. I've had him for a long time."
2887,My husband and I had a scare with our dog last year. Thankfully we found him a week later.
2887,We've been searching all over for him. We don't think he went far.
2887,Have you tried posting on your neighborhood's facebook page? Maybe your neighbors have seen him.
2887,"Yes, and we've gone door to door to ask."
2887,I hope your brother learned his lesson and he is more responsible in the future
2887,He's very remorseful.
2887,"Im sorry, hopefully he gets better in his adult life."
2887,We'll see if he does.
2887,i will keep my fingers crossed for you .
2888,I think it went pretty well but it
2888,but it....?\
2888,didn't mean to hit send lol.  It's hard to tell is what I was saying
2888," I know, and you have no way to continue after you hit enter. (assigned) ""I shop online alot and care bout the way I look when i'm in public"""
2888,That's true.  And do you?
2888,"I do utilize amazon and a few other sites regularly.  In public, i have no one to impress but my wife, she don't care."
2888,I get that.  I like amazon as well.  It's very convenient
2888,"it is.   click ""buy""..... 2 days pass...[empty wallet], [ring doorbell]"
2888,Sometimes now one day or same day too. it is great
2888,"not close enough to a center here but, 1-2 day delivery is very common.  always figured  condoms and TP would be most delivereed"
2888,Haha probably so.  I have a lot of my non perishable essentials like tp delivered monthly. I get gift cards so it's convenient
2888,We also order marital aids without judgment.  Been a game changer
2889,"It was a very strange incident. I met this guy at a bar. We were having great conversation, but everything went wrong when we went to his home.."
2889,What happened
2889,"Well he started to lick his teeth while we talked, and then he stared at my throat and asked what my blood type is."
2889,Okay that sounds weird and scary what did you do
2889,"When I realized he might be a vampire, I made a cross with my hands. He started hissing and backing away!"
2889,Okay that is good hope you got away safe 
2889,When I ran towards the door he bit me. Now the sun hurts my skin. Luckily Washington is very cloudy lol. It's just like Twilight.
2889,That's interesting so what do you like doing in your normal time
2889,"Usually I just hang out with my friends at night, but it's getting hard not to drink their blood. What do you like to do?"
2889,I like playing soccer and listening to my favorite band rise against
2889,I used to listen to Rise Against when I was younger. Do you have a favorite song by them?
2889,I like saviour
2889,I like good left undone. It has been fun chatting with you.

2890,Great! Stay positive! I'm certain you'll do well.
2890,I am just wondering who I am going to meet in front of me and what the first question would be.
2890,The best thing to do is not worry and just remember what you want to say to the interviewer. You will do just fine!
2890,"Yea i sure will, do you have any great tip i can keep in mind?"
2890,Just be yourself! You have a great personality. They'll love you!
2890,"Thank you for believing in me, you are making me feel i got it already,"
2890,Call me after the interview!
2890,"Sure i will, and hope to give you a great news"
2890,We'll go out and celebrate when you land the job.
2890,Sure its something great to shout about. 
2890,You pick the place! My treat.
2891,I think I'm going to go to St. Lucia.
2891,OOOH Lucky you! Never been there. Did spend 6 months in Mexico. Fantastic coffee and chocolate!
2891,"Oh, wow. Were there a lot of attractions in Mexico?"
2891,We did not do many attractions. We stayed small towns and quiet areas. Did go to the 
2891,That's the best way to do it. To see the real area.
2891,St Lucia will have beautiful blue water. You will really enjoy yourself there I bet
2891,I'm really looking forward to it. I've been saving for it for a few years.
2891,How long do you plan to be there?
2891,I'm looking to be there for a week.
2891,What language do they speak there?
2891,They speak English there.
2891,Oh! That would be good for me. I don't speak any other languages
2892,Good ones and bad ones. It's always hard seeing loved ones in photos that have passed on.
2892,I'm sorry. That must be difficult. I am glad you have pictures to hold on to though.
2892,"Oh yes, I am too. It's not always difficult, but I recently lost an uncle so going through old photos is really emotional anyway."
2892,I'm sorry to hear that.
2892,"Thank you, I appreciate it. So what about you? How's things been going for you?"
2892,"I'm fine, thanks! Everything is going well so far."
2892,That's good! Have you did anything fun lately?
2892,Just grabbed some pizza and spent some time in watching movies with my sweetheart.
2892,"Aww, that's really nice! I'm glad to hear that! Pizza sounds pretty good right now actually lol "
2892,"Pizza is my lifeblood, along with beer."
2892,I'm a wine-cooler woman! I'm not sure how great those would be with pizza though..hmm.
2892,Haven't tried wine coolers. Any specific one you would recommend?
2892,Seagrams Jamaican Me Happy is amazing! I don't drink often but its really good!
2892,I will have to try it out! Thanks. 
2893,"Currently I am unemployed, so I mostly just spend time listening to podcasts and studying conspiracy theories. "
2893,I work in grave yard hotel as an accountant
2893,That sounds spooky. Do you work all alone there?
2893,Not really got a really amazing team that i enjoy working with
2893,Okay I have a weird question for you. Is that okay?
2893,Okay go on
2893,Do you believe that NASA actually landed on the moon?
2893,Since they have been presenting to the public proof of pictures from the moon sure they have
2893,How do you know those pictures are real? I would argue that there is just as much proof that the pictures are fake.
2893,We all have to believe them scientifically .What is your favorite season ?I love winter season due to the snow
2893,I disagree but that is okay! My favorite season is autumn because of the red leaves. Such a beautiful sight to see.
2893,I love the snow because i get to wear some of my favprite clothes that i would never wear during summer and autumn season
2893,I can agree with that. I love wearing winter jackets. Winter is a better time for fashion.
2894,Because it sounds like you were hurt
2894,Some people may be but they were the best people i knew when it came to making jerky.
2894,Well that's something to think about I suppose
2894,"sadness is one thing, but I celebrate the fact that they were both able to rub that meat for the enjoyment of others"
2894,At least you can see the good
2894,see it/ feel it.   I prefer to spread it.
2894,I feel like there is an inappropriate undertone here and I'm not a fan
2894,context is an interesting thing.  I've only been focusing on the fact my father works for Stifel stock exchange.  I apologize if you jump to conlusions
2894,How accusing for someone who just completely changed topics
2894,If we weren
2894,what?
2894,"If we weren't separated by a keyboard,  things would make much more sense. My appoligies for any misunderstanding "
2895,Oh my! That is way over my skill level I sadly am currently unemployed
2895,"oh , i'm sorry . what field are you looking in ?"
2895,I have background in social services case management 
2895,Sounds like an interesting job. I hope you get that job that you're looking for.
2895,Thanks. Me too. The good part is that I have some savings to keep me afloat for a good while while I job hunt
2895,I know. Sometimes it's hard to have some left over after bills. What are you saving for?
2895,I was saving to go on vacation but not until I have a job to come home to
2895,a vacation sounds like a good idea to me ! Where do you plan on vacationing
2895,"Im not totally sure, but somewhere where I can hone my language skills. I also was for many years a professional translator"
2895,i would love to travel . what languages do you want to learn ?
2895,My dream is to become fluent in Japanese 
2895,japanese seems beautiful . where are you from ?
2896,What kind of things do you like to can?
2896,"That sounds like a good plan. How big is your garden?"" you mind telling me"
2896,It's fairly small since i don't have a lot of space in the yard.
2896,"If you like to garden you should look at Spring Hill Nurseries, what do you think?"
2896,"Thanks, I'll check it out. How about your garden, is it very big?"
2896,A decent size. It runs along the side of my house and I have 5 veggies and 7 herbs growing right now. 
2896,Sounds good. I recently became a vegan so the garden is supplying a lot of my food.
2896,Really Cool! What motivated you? I'm a vegan mostly due to philosophical reasons
2896,Same. I also like all the health benefits. My hair has never looked better. lol.
2896,"Never mind cause some people are bald and wish they had hair, so its nature"
2896,I guess you're right. What is your favorite thing in your garden? Mine is a giant rosemary bush i can smell from inside the house.
2896,"you have a good taste, mine are bell peppers , potatoes , corn , basil , rosemary . a lot of great stuff"
2896,It's been fun talking to you but i gtg.
2897,Technology for those with disabilities has come a long way
2897,Yeah thankfully there are many types of equipment to help disabled people function.
2897,It can definitely help in otherwise difficult outdoor settings
2897,Imagine if you had a powered chair though. Specialized sports wheelchairs might make it just as fun.
2897,I've heard that they do over the years
2897,"That's good,So tell me about yourself"
2897,what do you want to know?
2897,Anything like as for me i am married got 5 children but unfortuntely two passed away as i was giving birth
2897,I'm so sorry.  I'm 21 and about to gain 2 step children whom I love dearly.  Going to be a counselor
2897,Thats admirable wishing you well i work at my church's food pantry its very good to get to serve other people
2897,It is.  I'm in bible college.  Fiance is getting ordained as a law enforcement chaplain and i want to do le as well. it is
2897,Thats a great career! We need good counselors in schools!
2897,"Mine will probably be clinical with veterans and law enforcement, but yes.  and good luck to you!"
2898,What kind of bike?
2898,an electric one
2899,You should try it! Do you like to be outdoors?
2899,"I love being outdoors, especially places like the Grand Canyon, or even Oklahoma where everything is flat and open. You can see for miles. How about you?"
2899,Oh I love nature! I like being surrounded by like mountain landscapes and greenery as well as bodies of water! 
2899,Bodies of water are great too. Plenty of space. Do you have a favorite mountain?
2899,"I actually live not too far from the Appalachian Mountain range, so that's what I'm referencing and I think that qualifies as my favorite (for now!)"
2899,Wow I am jealous. Have you ever been to the Grand Tetons in Wyoming? I fell in love with that place.
2899,No I haven't! I'm not even sure I'd heard of it before now. Now I want to Google this! 
2899,Please google it. The Grand Tetons have been the inspiration of hundreds of historical paintings. I read that they represent the spirit of pioneers going west.
2899,I will do that! I studied art for a long time in high school and still did not know this! I'm going to pull this up right now actually!
2899,"Awesome. If you live near the Appalachians, have you by chance hiked any of the Appalachian trail?"
2899,I just pulled it up and it is breathtaking! My gosh! And no I haven't but I've always wanted to with friends.
2899,Me too. I might be mistaken but I think it's the longest continuous trail in America. If I had the money to quit my job I would try it.
2899,I don't blame you! Could be something to look forward to when you retire?
2899,I'm 25 so I might be able to get away with hiking it while I'm still in college. Thanks for the thoughtful responses by the way.
2899,Maybe so! I'm 26 and still figuring things out along the way. Hopefully we got a long life ahead! And you're welcome! Thank you too!
2899,You seem to have a solid head on your shoulders. I'm sure you will figure everything out. Have you had a lot of conversations today?
2899,"Thank you, I hope so! So far, I think I've had maybe....four or five? Never had this many in one night!"
2899,Same! Unfortunately I need to go heat up some food. If i'm lucky we will get the chance to talk again soon. Take care.
2899,That's fine! Enjoy your food and have a goodnight (or day?) I hope we can talk again soon sometime! You take care too!
2900,That sounds interesting. What's the name of the book?
2900,it is about a raccoon who saves the planet . it came out on ebook first .
2900,Interesting. What is the raccoon saving the planet from? 
2900,its about aliens invading the earth . i enjoy these types of flicks .
2900,"That's cool. Prefer reading about historical figures, it helps motivate me. I read a book about Napoleon recently that was really interesting. "
2900,I also like reading my favorite book is enders game
2900,"I haven't read that one, but I've heard good things about it. Isn't it a science fiction book? "
2900,Yes it is also presented as a movie you can check it out very interesting
2900,"Yeah, maybe I should do that. I'll probably read the book first. I feel like most of the time the books are better than the movie adaptations. "
2900,yea it wasnt the best but the 1985 sci fi novel has held up quite well
2900,"Cool, I think I'll check it out. Hey, do you happen to know of any food places around here? I hungry for some chicken right now, haha. "
2900,yes i love gyros . i make my own sometimes
2901,What's your favorite NFL game?
2901,Probably Madden. I tried some of the college games but didn't like them as much. Do you have a favorite NFL team?
2901,"Yes, I do. My favorite NFL team is the Patriots. What is your favorite NFL team?"
2901,I like the Steelers. It seems everyone in New Mexico has a different team since there are no pro sports there.
2901,That is true. My dogs & I love to watch their football games together here in New Mexico. Do you have any pets?
2901,I have 1 dog who likes to curl up on the couch with me while i read. What kind of dogs do you have ? Mine is a spaniel.
2901,We have two large Golden Retrievers. What kind of dog do you have?
2901,It is a king Charles Cavalier spaniel. Goldens are beautiful dogs.
2901,"Yes, it gets so hot here in New Mexico compared to where we moved from in Nevada. We can only let the dogs out for a short time."
2901,I love Nevada. I went to the Valley of Fire park this year. It was like walking on another planet.
2902,Do you mind visiting Seattle soon?
2902,I think I will! I've never been there before! I'd love to go hiking or backpacking there!
2902,That would be great. any time soon or next year?
2902,"Probably not any time soon, when would you think about visiting?"
2902,next year or maybe my next vacation in December.
2902,"That would be awesome, I hear that's a really nice time to visit. I hope you have a good time!"
2902,"Yes sure, I will let you know once am back."
2902,"I look forward to that! Who knows, maybe I will see you there."
2902,Yes that would be a great experience.
2902,I can't wait! What would you want to do there?
2902,Probably hiking or backpacking what do you think?
2902,That sounds amazing! We could look at all of the tourist spots or find some random trails ourselves.
2902,I really look forward to an amazing time.
2902,"I look forward to it as well, it will be a nice break from everything else."
2903,"It is! I did get a cake though, which was nice."
2903,What kind of cake was it?
2903,Well this year I was given an option. Traditional birthday cake or pumpkin roll. I went with a pumpkin roll!
2903,Oh wow. That's pretty cool. Did you enjoy it?
2903,"Yes I did! I prefer homemade ones though, but the one I got was great."
2903,Did you have time with family and friends?
2903,"Not on the day of my birthday, but days later, I met with a friend for lunch."
2903,That is sweet of them. At least you had that friend to meet with.
2903,"I enjoy spending time with her, we've been close since high school and she's always looking out for me."
2903,That's great. It's nice having life long friends.
2903,It is! I've had several come and go but I'm thankful for those who have stayed.
2903,You always know who you can count on. Hopefully your birthday next year is better.
2904,That's neat! Do you coupon much when you go to stores?
2904,i coupon to relieve stress . it feels good to save lots of money .
2904,Oh definitely! Buying anything for full price these days is practically a scam. I always shop around when I can.
2904,yes any time you can save money is great !
2904,Anything else you do to save money?
2904,"Well, ABC had an Extreme Couponing Show that would show you how far $50 could go.....it was amazing!"
2904,I've seen that wayyy back ago. I wish they made another season.
2904,Me too - It was very interesting. 
2904,Another show I'd wish they'd bring back on the air is Parking Wars. My dad loves that one.
2904,"I have not seen it yet, will check it out soon."
2904,I'd recommend it! 
2904,Anything else that you could recommend me watching online?
2905,"They have college for bike riding? JK, it sounds like a pretty good job."
2905,"I hope so, I love to help people."
2905,Me too. I help tutor kids with english as a side job. What do you do for a living?
2905,I work at a large company stocking shelves.
2905,Cool. What do you do for fun?
2905,I love to listen to music and go dancing on the weekends. 
2905,I love music too. I'm just now getting into secular music because my parents were pretty religous growing up.
2905,What's your favorite music artist?
2905,Right now probably the Beatles but it changes all the time. How about you?
2905,I like to listen to rock music and my favorite music group is Muse.
2905,Awesome. Are there a lot of good places to dance where you live?
2905,"Yes, there are plenty of places to dance. My favorite is at local dance studio."
2906,I really wish that I had more time to read.
2906,"I do read occasionally, do you?"
2906,I love to read. I just wish that I could find more time. I have been thinking about learning speed reading. What do you think?
2906,That's good i also like to read novels especially fictional stories
2906,I have been reading books on investing in the stock market. Do you invest in the stock market.
2906,Yes it is a very good way of making money especially for me now that i am a senior citizen
2906,"I am a little scared about the stock market, as many people speak of it as if it is almost alive."
2906,Yes there are some good and bad days in the stock market so it's all about taking risks
2906,I wonder if its a legitimate way of making money or is it just gambling.
2906,It's more of gambling but completely legal
2906,I wonder if I should start out with a small amount to test the waters.
2906,Yes you could it is a good idea
2906,I also think that my love of reading the news will give me an advantage when it comes to choosing stocks to buy.
2907,Yes very much .
2907,Where did you go to college.
2908,Did you qualify for your event?
2908,No I did not actually! I'm happy for you though!
2908,"I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you though, it means a lot! What will you do with your free time now?"
2908,You're very welcome! I think I might get back into writing again as well as painting maybe.
2908,"That's awesome, I have always enjoyed doing stuff like that. I'd love to see what you create sometime!"
2908,"I have too, I've always been into the arts! I'd be happy to share whatever I come up with!"
2908,I look forward to seeing it! Are you thinking about pursuing something in the arts as a career?
2908,"I would love to! In fact, I'd love to be a professional writer! I write more than I do other hobbies nowadays."
2908,"That's so cool! I have never been a great writer, but I love reading. Is there anything specific you like to write about?"
2908,My strongest stuff is usually supernatural related and/or romance. I grew up writing lots of fanfiction that I never shared with anyone but friends!
2908,"Nice! I feel like romance has always been a safe bet, and supernatural/fanfics are growing more in popularity I think. I hope it works out for you!"
2908,Thank you! I appreciate that! What do you like to do?
2908,"Sure thing! I really enjoy drawing, but have not made time for it recently. But I plan on changing that!"
2908,I hope you can find time to draw! Good luck!
2908,Thank you!
2909,That's lovely. You have nice taste. You appear to have a keen sense of music
2909,Well I was raised by a music loving family and they picked it up so well
2909,I am glad you have had an ambience that allowed you to shape your music skills. Way to go!
2909,I appreciate it my friend

2909,"sounds very cool id love to go listen someday, to Greek music, what your favorite artist"
2909,Stamatis kokotas
2909,"That's cool, I heard she puts on such a good show. "
2910,I'm married and my partner is away.
2910,How long you been married for? 
2910,For far too long. Ten years to long to be exact.
2910,That is a long time. Where did your partner go to and when will they be back?
2910,"She said she is going away to her parents for the weekend. But between me and you, I hope she stays there."
2910,Do you prefer the country or the city lifestyle? 
2910,"I love the city, but as I age, I've begun to long for the country."
2910,"I live on a farm with pigs, horses and hens. Maybe you can come visit sometime? "
2910,That's sounds great. Maybe I could bring my black Labrador with me.
2910,i am sure my dog would love a visitor as well.
2910,What breed is it?
2910,"It is a blue heeler mix, also known as an Australian Cattle Dog. I love him so much!"
2910,It was nice chatting with you.
2911,I totally am! Let me take a picture of us in my Ferrari.
2911,"i have never been on a Ferrari,i would like one day to be on one"
2911,"You can get some cheap used ones. It might fall apart, but it's cheap! Not cheap to fix, though."
2911,i don't believe there is a cheap Ferrari or even be able to get a cheaper one but i would try
2911,"You'd be surprised! I got mine used, and it saved a lot of money. What kind of car do you have currently?"
2911,"oh wow that,s good to know i am in love with a Ferrari  ,at the moment i have a ford "
2911,"Honestly, Ford is pretty good if you're just going from place to place. I can't really go grocery shopping in my Ferrari, or anything like that. "
2911,i don't  think so you can go anywhere with any type of car regardless of the make.
2912,"Yes, i read it too. Millionaires and the rich usually have a fine taste for art and often end up collecting masterpieces from renowned artists. "
2912,"Growing up I always dreamed of being a museum curator, are you a fan of art at all?"
2912,"Yes of course, my brother is a sketch artist, just as my dad is. I also do pencil and charcoal sketches. "
2912,"Oh wow, I wish I had an artistic talent - what sort of subject matter do you sketch?"
2912,"Usually faces, hands, hair, eyes, or sometimes plain scenaries. "
2912,"Impressive, is this just for fun or have you ever presented at a gallery or show?"
2912,Well it's just for fun. I wish i had a talent well enough to organise a show. I am aware of my limitations. 
2912,Maybe with time you'll get to that standard. What else do you do for fun?
2912,I write. Quite extensively. Presently i am writing fro my daughter.
2912,"Impressive, you are obviously very creative! How old is your daughter? What are you writing for her?"
2912,"She's five now. I write just about everything. How we spent time in Europe, why we moved to Melbourne and why we are in sydney, and more"
2912,"So you're artistic and well-travelled, an impressive combination! Where was your favourite place in Europe?"
2913,"Nah, he just gave me those puppy dog eyes and all was forgiven."
2913,Aww! I know that trick! My dog Lily pulls those puppy eyes too!
2913,"I wish i could learn that trick, it might make my job a little easier."
2913,Same! If only it worked as well with us humans as it does dogs!
2913,True. It does make me a littl sad that my Grandmother's blanket might be ruined now though.
2913,Oh no! I hope it's not ruined! Toss it in the wash after spraying it down with some Shout!
2913,Good idea. What kind of dog is Lily?
2913,Lily is a long haired Chihuahua. I raised her from a puppy!
2913,Awesome. The first movie i ever made was a horror movie that had an adorable Chihuahua in it.
2913,Awww! That's cool. Are you a filmmaker? 
2913,"No, an actor. Mainly bit parts though. How about you, what do you do for a living?"
2913,That's pretty cool. I work from home for a technology company rating landing pages. I write on the side and hope to publish a book one day.
2913,Well good luck with everthing i gtg. Nice talking to you.
2913,Thank you and good luck to you too! Nice talking to you as well!
2914,"I live with my boyfriend so we go to the movies as well, do you likegoing to the movies?"
2914,I love going to the movies too. And also getting food

2914,Yes the prices and sometimes the people can also be very crazy
2914,What is the last movie you went to go see in the movies?
2914,The last movie was Irma last year
2914,We really enjoyed watching Alladdin a few weeks ago.
2914,Was it the one that had a lot of concert sequences?
2914,It was the remake of the old Alladdin disney movie. 
2914,Do you make money through selling your jewelry?
2914,"I make a little , but its more of a fun hobby."
2914,"Oh, okay. I would like you to make me a necklace"

2915,Do you like to go hiking?
2915,Yes I do enjoy hiking. From time to time I will enjoy a day hike.
2915,I love being outside and enjoying the enviroment!
2915,Eventually i'd really love to be able to travel abroad.
2915,Where would you want to go?
2915,"Somewhere far away like Japan, but I like to keep my stay short because I get homesick sometimes."
2915,"Yes traveling is fun, but there is no place like home."
2915,I am with you there.  I hope you get a chance to go somewhere sometime though.
2915,My best friend is from switzerland i want to go very soon!
2915,"What?! You should make her go on a trip with you, and you will have your very own personal tour guide."
2916,The weather is a bit cold but manageable
2916,Amazing how varied the temperatures are there around globe. It's super hot in Sydney now.
2916,"That is so amazing. We had a very hot summer, I am welcoming this cold ,though I know it will be extreme"
2916,I see. How cold does it get at your place? is it close to the Canadian border?
2916,Not really but it goes down to 0 just like that during winter
2916,"Wow ! used to be the same when i was in the UK. Here its summer, by your standards, year round"
2916,I know. You are lucky it is summer. Do you love animals?
2916,"Yes i do. Mostly dogs. My wife and kid like cats, eeek. i am simply sacred of them though"
2916,I have two snakes as my pets
2916,Oh no! are they poisonous? rattlesnakes?
2916,"No, nothing like that. They are just small house snakes"
2916,Never heard of house snakes! what do you feed them?
2917,"I love all kinds, but i really enjoy french fries!"
2917,Me too! Especially chili cheese fries! Do you like toppings on your fries?
2917,I usually dont because i work alot and need to eat fast.
2917,"Oh, okay. You should find some time to eat slower and savor your food!"
2917,I recently died my hair pink though and love it!
2917,"I change my haircolor often too. Sometimes, it's purple!"
2917,oh wow! i bet that would look cool!
2917,It's really fun to have different hair colors than the norm.
2917,what other colors do you do?
2917,I also like colors like blue and green.
2917,Do you ever mix colors?
2917,"Sometimes, if I'm feeling adventurous."
2918,quite a cute family there
2918,what are their names then
2918,The little one is John and the lady is Tasha
2918,That is so neat.  Are they at the age that they like the Australian Band Hi-5?  My kids love to binge watch their show!
2918,actually they love the band too.
2918,Awesome! They play some good music!
2918,Yes little Tasha loves music very much
2918,What about your favorite food? Mine is pizza.
2918,quite a coincidence i too happen to love pizza with chilly spices
2918,"Ohh yeah, that sounds really good."
2918,Do you have a family yourself?
2918,No i do not. But i wish someday after getting married i will have my own. Do you like kids?
2919,She was just shocked more than anything! How is your day going today?
2919,fine ! i just got back in from playing basketball .
2919,"Oh nice, which position do you play? Can you dunk?"
2919,"I play point guard and can dunk, but prefer to assist others. "
2919,A real team player. What do you do for work? My boyfriend is struggling to find a job and i'm starting to worry
2919,i work in an office/ sales department. My girlfriend is not working now too. 
2919,"Oh we have the same problem - what's your strategy? All my boyfriend does is play videogames and drink beers, I can't get him motivated"
2919,Do you think you are going to break up with him ?
2919,"No, we have a baby so that's not really an option - it will get sorted i'm sure, I just need to snap him out of it!"
2919,"I am sure you will too, have you spoke to him about your frustrations? "
2919,"Yeah he knows but it's tough, I don't want to feel like a nagging mother you know? I can take extra shifts it'll be ok"
2919,How old is your baby? We are expecting our second child soon. 
2920,It did and now I have enough money put back to go see my favorite singer.
2920,That is nice. Who was the singer?
2920,Justin Timberlake. I just love him and have always wanted to see him live.
2920,"I agree, Justin Timberlake even expanded into acting. I loved his role in "
2920,"What movie? He is a good actor too, but a much better singer."
2920,"He was in ""Bad Teacher""."
2920,Of course. He was also a voiceover in Trolls.
2920,Well i didn't even know about that one. Was he in anything else that you know of?
2920,He was in The Social Network about Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg.
2920,"Ah i have never seen it, was the movie worth watching?"
2920,"It's decent, but I don't Jesse Eisenberg. He played Mark, but he has such a horrible attitude in reality."
2920,I'm not famaliar with jesse myself.
2920,Good you're not. It was nice talking. Have a great day!
2921,It was a random day. My bosses decided it was a holiday.
2921,"Since I work at a fast food place and always wear purple, my friends call me the cookie monster."
2921,But I thought the cookie monster was blue?
2921,"Yeah, but my friends do drugs."
2921,That would explain why they think that.
2921,I really think they need to get some help.
2921,You should let them know
2921,What are you going to do on your day off?
2921,I'm going to play some video games!
2921,What kind of video games are you into?
2921,I really like Call of Duty
2921,"I used to play COD, but now I'm addicted to Rainbow Six Siege."
2922,Just an old classic i love watching because it inspires me.
2922,Gotta love movies.  One of my favorites is Ferris Bueller's Day off.  A classic from 1986.
2922,Nice. I love Gone With The Wind by Margaret Mitchell
2922,I love that movie.
2922,I know. What else do you do? I am a professional baker
2922,"i am an awesome baker, and i love to run!"
2922,That is wonderful. What do you love making. I specialize in birthday and wedding cakes
2922,i make wedding cakes and other pastries .
2922,"Lovely, we should share recipes, maybe you know something i don't or vice versa"
2922,"I dont know any off hand, but that would be fun."
2922,Sure thing. Or maybe do an old classic movie together and enjoy a day of eating
2922,oh that would be a lot of fun . i love to eat .
2923,"Yes, she really likes it so it's win-win."
2923,Did you top it up with butter? my daughter loves it a lot !
2923,"No, I've never tried that. Is it good?"
2923,"Yes it is! gives a buttery taste that kids simply love, specially the fussy ones like my daughter."
2923,I'll have to try that one day. It seems like a good idea!
2923,"Yes you can try it - however you like, steam, bake fry or grill, butter makes it tasty"
2923,Do you have other suggestions?
2923,Of course. Eggs and butter are quite popular. You can include boiled chicken or tuna as well
2923,Tuna in chicken soup? 
2923,Eek. Sorry about that. I somehow imagined i was chatting about noodles. Forgot it's a chicken noodle soup
2923,That's fine. I was just a little confused.
2923,No worries. What's your favorite Asian food?
2924,"I like it a lot, but my work really keeps me from playing my violin as much as I would like."
2924,How long have you been playing?
2924,I have been playing as a hobby since I was 14. I mostly play electric violin. What about you?
2924,my whole life really . i do not play as much as i used to though .
2924,"Well, life gets in the way and there isn't much that can be done about it. Do you play electric or acoustic?"
2924,"I like acoustic more for the most part, as I like how the hollow wood sounds compared to the electric amp."
2924,"That's interesting. I do like the acoustic sounds as it is more natural, but I like the amped sound a bit more."
2924,"It's funny how it's designed so the hollow body acts almost like an echo chamber, resonating sound when you pluck the strings."
2924,"I agree, it takes a lot of engineering that most people don't understand or have a clue about. Do you have other hobbies?"
2924,I do have activities I do for enjoyment. My favorite is golf.
2924,Interesting. Do you like watching it on television or just playing/
2924,I catch it on tv sometimes but id say i prefer playing. Do you play at all?
2924,"Same for me, I'd much rather play. Well, it's been nice chatting. Have a great day!"
2925,I was very hungry.
2925,"I know, I was hungry too. Hungry Like The Wolf! Sorry it was a song that I was listening to yesterday, although relevant here."
2925,What kind of music do you listen to?
2925,"Classical, how about you my friend?"
2925,"rap, and i also enjoy traveling!"
2925,That sounds nice. I will be traveling more soon
2925,Where do you plan to go?
2925,Europe.....what do you plan to see first? I'm starting at the end of this month.
2925,I want to go to switzerland.
2925,I am thinking about heading to Switzerland.
2925,Have you ever been there?
2925,"No, I've never been there either."
2926,They told me its lung cancer.
2926,I am sorry to hear that. Do you smoke cigarettes? 
2926,"I never have myself, my ex wife did though."
2926,Have you heard the song by imagine dragons - Believer? 
2926,"Probably at some point, why do you ask?"
2926,"I really like the band, that song has helped me through some dark times. "
2926,"I could use all the help i can get, right now im just feeling really down about this whole thing."
2926,"I cannot imagine what you must be feeling. Maybe talking about something else, can take your mind off it ? What is your favourite food?"
2926,Im quite fond of pizza i happen to have one in the oven as we speak.
2926,"I love crab, especially dipped in butter."
2926,"The butter definitely helps, I don't really have any good places for crabs around here though."
2926,I have one great seafood place nearby. I always get their crab and dip it in butter. 
2927,Since I have blond hair some people thought I would fail the exam.
2927,"I suppose that sounds about right... I have really dark hair. Did you know that ""blond' was first documented in English in 1481?"
2927,"No, I didn't know that. "
2927,Are you taking other classes other than calculus during the summer?
2927,I'm taking a dermatology class because I hope to learn some way of dealing with my smelly feet.
2927,"that makes a lot of sense, I've noticed my honda civic has been smelling since we carpooled the other day"
2927,How long have you had that car for?
2927,"10 years, way too long"
2927,When do you think you will be able to get a new car?
2927,as soon as i get my new job working as a professional food taster
2927,Wow that sounds like a dream job
2927,food is the answer to all of our problems. do you have a favorite food?
2928,Do you enjoy the work?
2928,"Of course, quite a lot. I spend most of my time in forests with huge trees around."
2928,"Sounds like quite a work out, what do you enjoy doing outside of work?"
2928,We do car racing after we are doing lumberjacking
2928,I enjoy reading and working on my beadwork myself.
2928,"I do that too, but occasionally though"
2928,"I don't read quite as often as i used to, i've had issues finding something that really draws me in lately."
2928,"I've had such issues myself. Unless it is a real thriller, i would end up flicking a few pages and toss it across"
2928,"I hear you on that, just can't get into some books."
2928,True. Of late i have been into non-fiction. Have you tried non-fiction?
2928,"Not particularly, I can't say i've came across a topic that really intrigues me."
2928,"I see. I am enchanted about the universe, its origin, and what's beyond"
2929,"Yes it was, I was so grateful."
2929,"Thats awesome, probably made you feel right at home too!"
2929,Yes he did. I got to go to bed early and well rested.
2929,"Awesome, how many hours of sleep do you get?"
2929,I hardly put in 4 hours on a busy time. But yesterday I slept 7 hours.
2929,that's awesome ! glad you are well rested
2929,"I am glad too. On the weekends, especially Sundays after church, I like to watch a movie"
2929,"I hear you :) I do the same, i like watching ted talks."
2929,Nice. It prepares me for a very busy week ahead.
2929,"yes , for sure ! i wish the weekend was longer !"
2929,"I know. But it still wouldn't make a difference, because busy would come in and interrupt! "
2929,"That's funny - true.  Hopefully the good part outweighs that, though."
2930,Do you have any experience with dogs?
2930,"I do not just a cat, but im sure id love having a dog."
2930,"That's nice, what's your cat's name?"
2930,"Her name is bella, what is your dogs name"
2930,"Teddy, or Ted. He looks a bit like a bear."
2930,Well thats cute
2930,"I meant she of course, it's a gender fluid dog."
2930,What do you mean by that?
2930,"Well seeing as I reffered to her as ""she"" in my first sentence but named her Ted three sentences later I had to improvise a bit. "
2930,ohhhh okay that makes more sense
2930,"Well anyway, I think I need to take Ted out for a walk now. It was nice talking to you."
2930,nice talking to you for sure
2931,"Yeah, my mom is a dentist and made me an appointment for a cleaning today."
2931,I bet you have really nice looking teeth.
2931,"I do. I'm really glad that my mom took care of them while I was growing up. I used to hate it, but now I appreciate it so much."
2931,"Yes, sometimes parents know best. Mine encouraged my education a lot and now i have a pretty good job."
2931,What do you do for work?
2931,"I just started working on Waymo at Google. How about you, what do you do for a living?"

2950,"Yeah, it's a very long run. What is the fastest you have ever ran a mile? I once did it in 4 minutes."
2950,Wow that's really good. I'd say I average about 5 minutes a mile during a marathin.
2950,That's very good. I've never tried to run a marathon. I could probably run a half-marathon.
2950,It takes a while to build up the endurance but if you can get yourself through a half-marathon I'm sure you could be running a full one within months!

2950,For about 6 and a half years. 
2950,That's a while. Do you run everyday?

2953,I enjoy skimboarding.
2953,Sounds fun. Good talking to you i gtg.
2954,"Baking is great, but I try to watch my diet sometimes."

2955,"Sounds problematic, how do you plan to resolve issues like these?"
2955,"we have been engaging youths to enlighten them about the dangers,there is also cases of rise of racial tensions too"
2955,"Oh goodness, that sounds like a very tough issue but some incredibly valuable work. Are you seeing any improvements?"
2955,"its quite tough but we are optimistic,yes there is considerable improvement"
2955,"Great work, you must be so proud. Do you get any time to unwind? Or just work and mobilization?"
2955,Yes we have time of to unwind are reflect on our little achievement

2957,Do you have anything planned for tonight?
2957,No solid plans but it's Friday so may spoil myself and pick up a takeaway and have a few drinks! 
2957,"Sounds like a good night to me, what do you like drinking?"

2960,oh I dont think I have ever tried that. I will add it to my todo list.!
2960,You absolutely should! Their pizza marinara is great too if that's more your thing. 
2961,To what school?
2961,im now doing my degree in business
2961,Oh how fun. What year are you in/
2961,am in my final year am glad i will be soon graduating
2961,Yes I bet that is a great feeling. I am studying fashion in seattle.
2961,Wow that's awesome i also love fashion
2961,Really thats amazing. I love fall fashion.
2961,when are you finishing this course?
2961,"In the spring of next year,"
2961,"I wish you all the best ,i believe you are going to make it"
2961,"Thanks, And as for you to . I hope your business degree becomes succesful!"
2961,Hoping so i have done my best
2962,Yes my favorite color is purple what is yours? 
2962,Dark purple or Dark blue/purple I like the way it makes me feel. Bright colors give me headaches.
2962,Yeh i know what you mean. The color pallet in my garden is really pretty especially in autumn. 
2962,Fall is a beautiful time of year although I don't really have anyone to share the views with so I just hang out at home.
2962,Yes i am the same actually. Its nice to watch the leaves fall from the trees.
2962,Do you get out much? I live in the city so I don't get to see much from my one window apartment.
2962,Yeh i go on a lot of walks . I live in a very rural area though so its not so busy here. 
2962,I am not sure I could live in a rural area. Too quiet and I like having things delivered same day. How far are you from a big city?
2962,Its about 40 minutes away but its not a big city really. I dont need to buy things and im happy with myself without distractions. I dont need constant pleasures.
2962,"I was referring more along the lines of groceries, my medication and necessities. I work from home and have a lot of anxiety so I try not to go out."
2962,Ah i see thats a shame. I think i would have anxiety if i lived in a big city too. I grow alot of my own food 
2962,Homegrown food is delicious. I have a cherry tomato plant and some herbs but all the fresh veggies must be nice. Do you live on a farm?
2963,He thinks he's too good for that. He's just so spoiled.
2963,Has he always been that way?
2963,"Yes, our parents always wanted a boy so they would always get preferential treatment. "
2963,That's too bad. My brothers always got their way when i was younger so i became a vegan just to have something of my own.
2963,That's an interesting turn of events. How is that working out for you? 
2963,No complaints. What is your favorite kind of food?
2963,My oldest is vegan so we rarely eat meat at our house but I do like my seafood pastas.
2963,I saw vegan shrimp and crab cakes at the store the other day! The best seafood i ever had was fake and came from the Veggie house in Vegas.
2963,Really? I've had meat substitutes but never fish. Would like to try that
2963,They can even make shrimp that looks like the real thing.
2963,Why would you want that though? I think the texture is the worst thing about shrimp haha
2963,You may be right I just thought it was neat how far they have come with some of that food.
2963,It is truly astonishing! 
2963,It's been nice talking to yo but i gtg. take care.
2964,Cool I have been playing some music all day.What are you drawing?
2964,"Am also doing very fine over here,just chilling in the house"
2964,Oh how fun. Do you like to draw in your home?
2964,I dont know how to draw but i know it is very interesting
2964,Oh yes it is. Also gardening can be fun when your at home. I love to grow tomatoes.
2964,I do farming it is very interesting
2964,Oh how exciting.What kind of animals is on the farm?
2964,I do poultry farming 
2964,That sounds cool. Is it hard?
2964,It needs passion it takes a lot of time 
2964,Time with outside tasks is always needed.
2964,It also require a lot of capital 
2965,"I know,, I do have one, His name is timmy."
2965,i really dont have one
2965,"todd i mean, i rescued mine from a terrible home."
2965,Wow thats so caring of you
2965,"Thank you, He is such a sweetheart. He loves to talk. Do you own any animals?"
2965,i have a puppy i named it triza 
2965,Awe how cute. What kind of puppy is it?
2965,"my mum gave me the puppy as a birthday gift ,its from italy"
2965,awe how nice of her. puppies are a true bestfriend.
2965,"I really love it ,it is always on my side when am home"
2965,Awe sounds very adorable.
2965,"She is such a darling,i can send it even to the shop"
2966,I like to add some sugar to my brine.Do you cook from scratch much?
2966,"Yes I do, it's so much healthier if you can."
2966,True but sometimes the comfort food isn't all that healthy but it sure tastes good. What do you like to cook?
2966,"Sure but not all comfort food needs to be processed, take a fesh pasta for example. "
2966,"Sometimes you turn that pasta into a nice cheesy dish though, lol.I like to can foods as well. Even pickle my own foods"
2966,"Yeah that's very true. I like the idea of that, what do you pickle?"
2966,"cucumbers, beets, misc things but my favorite thing to pickle are eggs. My family just loves them.You ever try them?"
2966,"No, sorry, I don't really like eggs. I do love pickled onions though, they're my favourite."
2967,"Which kind wired things ,i would really love to know"
2967,Curiousity gets to ya sometimes.
2967,"purposely peeing in the bed is very wired ,how could he even tolerate the smell"
2967,i know right . i believe that everyone does weird things .
2967,Sure you are right
2967,Some adults realize that the behaviors do not make sense.
2967,some of the behaviors turns me off
2967,"Yes, most adults realize that their actions don't make sense however, they can't stop."
2967,Some of them are so embarrassing tings that should not be done 
2967,But what is it that drives them to do such outlandish things do you think?
2967,I guess just crezy minds
2967,"They all make think of Ted Bundy , can't trust them."
2968,I'd say I agree with that statement. It depends on what you've learned and what experiences you've had for how you process those symbols.
2968,"Absolutely, and reading definitely isn't for everyone, it's not like a movie where you just need your eyes."
2968,Reading I think is something that depends on the situation. I think anyone can enjoy it with the right time and material. 
2968,"yes , it requires an upper level of comprehension , i suppose ."
2968,"Not exactly. For example I really like the Game Of Thrones books, but wouldn't enjoy a romance novel. The level of reading is the same, but the context is different."
2968,"I will agree with you on that, I can relate to what you're saying. All about preference."
2968,Timing can be an issue too. I spend a lot of time listening to books and materials rather than reading them.
2968,"I think audibles are great for someone on the go, whether it's driving to work, exercising, or shopping. You can never have enough knowledge."
2968,"Yeah, I can listen to them while cleaning around the house, driving somewhere, or even while working depending on the tasking."
2968,"I personally have never tried audible books, I should though. I guess I'm old fashoned. I am open to trying new things though."
2968,"Audio books can be sorta expensive, but podcasts are a good way to start. You can listen to things like news, fiction, history, or talk about topics like movies."
2968,"Actually I'm a big fan of podcasts and watch them on YouTube. I guess without the visual experience, it's no different. I think I would actually enjoy them."
2969,Oh wow thats interesting. Where did you learn that?
2969,I studied English at University. I enjoy words. What do you like doing in your spare time?
2969,I work at a hospital and go to college so am always busy.
2969,What do you do in the hospital? Are you a doctor?
2969,I'm training at the moment. Hopefully one day. What do you do?
2969,I work in the military as a solider at the moment. When will you finish doctor training?
2969,It's a 5 year course and I'm 2 years into it so nearly halfway. Soldier? That's interesting. Do you enjoy it?
2969,It takes a long time to become a Doctor. Yeah I enjoy it. My knees hurt from years of walking with weight though! What do you do on the weekends?
2969,That's understandable. I enjoy taking walks and seeing my family. Very busy though so don't get enough time to do it recently.
2969,I like going running in the weekends to explore new places. You must be very busy with learning to be a doctor
2969,"Very busy, but I'm hoping it's all for a good cause one day. Running is a good hobby! I wish I was more active."
2969,Your training will be worth it in the end. It is a noble thing to do. How tall are you?
2970,I dont advocate for divorce
2970,"Anyway, what do you enjoy doing? Personaly i like the outdoors."
2970,i  love going shopping 
2970,"Interesting, what do you like shopping for? Clothes, gadgets, anything in particular?"
2970,i like buying clothes and household items
2970,"I don't mind shopping too much , if its the sporting goods store anyway. Im a tennis fan."
2970,i like watching soccer
2970,"Cool, anything else that you enjoy?"
2970,i like playing online games
2970,what ones? 
2970,fancy pants
2970,ive never heard of that. whats it about?
2971,"It never works, he just gets angry at that point and refuses to do things. "
2971,You could look up ways of punishment online in hopes of finding a solution. I personally would just threaten to sell his game system. 
2971,"He's very crafty, he gets it from my husband, he's a lawyer."
2971,"Next time he wants a game, you could make a list of chores for him to do. Once he finishes his chores he could be rewarded."
2971,"That could be a good solution. He doesn't mind walking the dogs, but it gets him out. I could ask him to do that."
2971,"Yeah, anytime he wants something, he should earn it. Kids aren't getting out as much because of technology. It saddens me."
2971,"Fair, I don't want him thinking he gets whatever he wants."
2971,"Exactly, that's the main thing, he would be spoiled to the point where he will resist like you said. Have to do that asap."
2971,Thanks for the advice!
2971,"Absolutely, also if you feel like building a better relationship would help. Try bonding with him more, could also work."
2971,"We have a good relationship, he just likes video games way too much haha."
2971,"I see, kids can be stubborn. I was the same way. One of the best things to do is sit down with him and reason with him."
2972,What sorts of sports do you enjoy?
2972,"I love Football, Basketball and Baseball. What about yourself?"
2972,"Baseball is fun, but I usually only watch if I go to the game in person. I enjoy Football during playoffs and the super bowl. Mainly I like soccer though."
2972,"I see, I've been to a few baseball games. I usually only watch soccer during the World Cup, it's so exciting to watch!"
2972,"I just appreciate the athleticism. The field is huge, so much running and coordination. "
2972,Oh absolutely. It requires an extreme amount of fitness. I could never do what those guys do. Definitely an incredible skill they have.
2972,"I wouldn't say I'm in bad shape, but I certainly could never subject myself to something like that."
2972,Same here. How long have you been watching soccer for? 
2972,"Since college, I had some friends who liked it and realized it was fun. "
2972,Ah yeah it's great to be introduced to things and realizing you love it. I introduced myself to all sports. Great past-time and a way of bonding with others.
2972,You watch with any family ?
2972,"Most of the time no, it's pretty rare. I seem to be the only one in my family that actually enjoys sports."
2973,They also need a similar diet and to eat well as I try to do myself
2973,thats is really interesting.What others animals are related?
2973,Foxes are related
2973,i have 2 dogs at  home
2973,"My dog recently passed away, so I've tried to be ore social"
2973,I am so sorry to hear that
2973,"Thank you, it's been rough."
2973,I can only imagine
2973,"It has made me get more open and out, social wise."
2973,I am glad you find a way out on this
2973,Do you have any pets?
2973,I do have 2 dogs an a cat
2974,"Probably just practising the piano as usual, you?"
2974,I have a stack of books I've been waiting to read.  
2974,What kind of books?
2974,Mysteries.  There's always something to figure out.  
2974,I do like mystery books. It would be cool to take part in a real life mystery.
2974,It definitely would.  You mentioned piano.  What kind of music do you play?
2974,"Classical music mostly, but sometimes more modern music."
2974,Interesting.  Do you play any other instruments?
2974,"No, just piano. My father taught me when I was young."
2974,"That's a great way to spend time with family.  In our house, no one plays any music, but we enjoy each other's company over good food. "
2974,That sounds really nice. What kind of food?
2974,"Pizza, usually.  But sometimes we decide to try something upscale, like French cuisine.  "
2975,"Not yet, just for fun. I love to exercise so its just an outlet"
2975,What kind of dancing are you doing?
2975,"Hip hop. Anyway, enought with me tell us about you."
2975,"I am not involved in dancing, but I am environmental engineer by occupation!"
2975,"Nice, how long have you been doing that for?"
2975,"For 5 years in Portland, but before that I was involved in finance for another 4"
2975,So what made you switch?
2975," I find the job to be hypocritical and only serving the interest of shareholders, but not society. Environmental engineering is as challenging, but more rewarding in my opinion!"
2975,Nice any hobbies going at the moment?
2975,"I really like music, I play drums and guitar! How about you?"
2975,I like hiking and also dance but thats about it.
2975,Where was the last place you went hiking?
2976,"ugh, frustrating. I think I have a cure though. "
2976,Oh really? What's the cure?
2976,"It's sorta silly, but just a day of rest, eating well, and drinking lots of water. Usually fixes me right up. "
2976,Not silly at all! Actually I tend to do the same exact thing. I usually don't take any medicine.
2976,"I usually don't either. I might take something to help my nose if it's really runny, just to sleep. "
2976,"Makes sense, that's usually what would keep me up is the runny nose. Those along with the sore throat is usually the worst. "
2976,yeah that just makes everything awful if you have a sore throat. Chewing gum actually helps a bit for me.
2976,Really? I've never tried that actually. I love learning about possible remedies. For me usually just water to keep my throat moist.
2976,It could just be that I love bubblegum. My friends actually used to call me that as a nickname. 
2976,"Haha that's funny, mine was skittles, not even sure why! I accepted it and it stuck."
2976,"lol. It was fun having a nickname, idk why...just sorta nice to be part of the group I guess."
2976,"Definitely, I can agree with that. I miss those times, they were great and stress-free."
2977,What kind of cars?
2977,They are basically street cars with all glass and fuel tank removed.You have a special fuel cell in the trunk. Where do you volunteer
2977,I do a lot of walks for different charities. I also help out at shelters.
2977,I walk dogs at the local shelter twice a week.
2977,I always want to take them home with me. What type of charity events have you had at your track?
2977,Different every other week. A representative will come and we give them a portion of the ticket sales.
2977,And they're responsible for boosting advertisement and getting more people there?
2977,"We advertise at the start of the season which charity will benefit at each event. We donate a minimum of $1,500"
2977,That's quite generous. How far in advance do I need to contact you do get things set up?
2977,We can get you on the schedule for next year.I'm either at the track or at home playing board games with my daughters.
2977,Ok. I think that could fit for a Alzheimer event I want to do. I'll be in contact soon. Enjoy the board games 
2977,Thanks take care and I look forward to working with you to help your charity.
2978,"I am a big fan of Game of Thrones, especially all the dragons and their fire."
2978,I like a lot this show. I am a big fan but I never read the books. One day hopefully
2978,The books are very enjoyable and more in depth than th show.
2978,I will definitely look at reading them. What are your hobbies?
2978,"I enjoy reading, travel, watching movies, and practicing vegetarianism"
2978,That sounds interesting. Vegetarianism seems a noble way of life. Is your motivation health-related?
2978,"It is, plus about respecting other living beings"
2978,"yes , i think that is how all beings should live. How long have you been practising?"
2978,4 years now
2978,"wow, you must be very motivated. I was considering veganism but don't think I could live without my tea."
2978,It took some time to adjust when beginning for sure
2978,"Good luck to you, very hard work. Do you drink tea?"
2979,"I know, it's strange. I wouldn't be able to live without my high speed access now!"
2979,"when i first downloaded songs, i would start the process and run errands and it would still not be done when i got back, napster days"
2979,It's weird to think that was only a short amount of time ago. I used to play chess while waiting for things to download
2979,i have decent speed now
2979,Mine is really high speed now! What do you do on the internet?
2979,i play chess and fool around with stocks
2979,I'd love to play you at chess some time. I'm unbeatable!
2979,"no one is unbeatable, there is a bonehead move in all of us"
2979,"That's true, but I haven't been beaten yet"
2979,that is quite the record.how often have you played?
2979,I play quite a ot. I've played since I was a child.
2979,"I play on chess.com, it is really neat playing someone on the other side of the worls and it happens instantly"
2980,Yeah i agree
2980,"As an accountant, I worked as part of the Facebook team."
2980,Thats great i also dream of working in the facebook team
2980,"No problem, it must be huge if corporations like that use it. Facebook and Instagram are huge."
2980,I also think javascript coding was used in twitter
2980,"Javascript is defiitely quite diverse. It's funny it marks errors in red, which happes to be my favorite color"
2980,Yeah thats also the part that impressed me the red color
2980,It's a good color
2981,yes addiction to shopping is bad for me.
2981,Same. I go into a store for one thing and I come out with 12. Do you shop online or in stores more?
2981,i do both at Holiday i go crazy 
2981,"Yes, I go on vacation just to shop. What are you favorite places?"
2981,I love to go to new York. wow you go vacation just to shop. lol 
2981,Well shop and party. LOL  New York is amazing. 
2981,yes New York is very nice i to go to Macy's to shops.

2982,since the early 1920's  maybe a little longer
2982,"Yeah. Back on April 17, 1964, the 1965 Mustang was launched, but it was dubbed as a 1964 !/2. lol."
2982,"i really like the new mustangs, would love a cobra but then i would lose my license"
2982,"Oh boy so do I. They are extremely nice cars. I would love to own one, but the same thing would happen to me haha."
2982,"my mother owned 1965 mustang for many years, she loved when people admired it"
2982,I'll bet you're right! Some people say that the Mustang helped inspire other cars
2982,"mustangs were one of the early fastbacks, a few years later and there were lots of fastbacks, even the name sounded cool:""mustang fastback"""
2982,"Oh man, just saying that name brings back nostalgia for me!"
2982,the chase seen in Bullit was really a cool chase. I'm still not sure how the green vw kept up
2982,Yeah I don't know either.
2982,i read that the charger had to slow down and let the stang catch up
2982,"yeah , lol i liked them before they were bud horses . lol advertising takes everything"
2983,I have kids as I teach cheerleading when I have free time
2983,Teaching is a great tool for building goods kids. Human interaction really helps them in life.
2983,I definitely love having family time
2983,"It's important to make family time. You have to find a way to make it when it's really busy, but it's crucial."
2983,Hpw many members in your family?
2983,My immediate family is my folks and my two little sisters. I got a bunch of really cool aunts and cousins. I have one Uncle who is a rockstar!
2983,Ah wow. I've got a son and grandson living with me
2983,Having multiple generations is awesome for learning. It's learning history through living it!
2983,"Exactly, and you learn new thingsa l the time"
2983,No doubt. And great learners make great teachers!
2983,This too. Between family and cheerleading ot much time
2983,Sports is also great for kids and their fitness.
2984,I love to be engaged with the enviroment.
2984,Yes our water laws help us prevent the release of pollutants into our stored drinking water. We are very fortunate.
2984,do you like to take pictures?
2984,"I love taking pictures, unfortunately there's no scenery around me to take pictures of."
2984,"Ah,what area are u located?"
2984,Houston. It's flat. I enjoy mountains or hills. I would love to photograph things of that nature.
2984,Yes houston seems nice but not much scenery.
2984,"Yeah, I think the Rocky mountains look very pretty. I also enjoy nature in general. What about yourself?"
2984,"I live in the florida region, so i love being outdoors!"
2984,I've been to Florida! I actually really enjoy the beaches there.
2984,clearwater is very nice.
2984,That is the reason Clearwater has  been ranked one of the best beaches in the United States.
2985,"Is fly fishing pretty easy? I love to fish, but, I'm 70 so I take it easy."
2985,i really enjoy surf fishing
2985,I've never tried that before. I've seen folks doing it though.
2985,it is a good reason to drink beer and watch the beach
2985,Sounds like it! Have you ever caught a shark?
2985,"just very small ones, 18 inch or less, i once saw a whale jump while sitting on beach"
2985,Oh wow that is awesome! The neatest I've seen were groups of dolphins playing in the surf.
2985,"different times of the year, you catch different fish,i like the pompano in spring"
2985,My favorite is just fishing for the humble Red Snapper from a pier. Its just a good way to relax.
2985,"i once fed yellotail snapper left over spaghetti while scuba diving, they loved it"
2985,I caught a huge flounder once. It was not happy about it!
2985,why were you not happy? flounder is good eating
2986,He called me out in front of people and accused me of something I did not do
2986,I would have hated to be publically humiliated. I probably would have quit.
2986,I have a quick temper and it did not go very well. 
2986,It wouldn't have for me either. I can not take that kind of embarrassment.
2986,Do you like to travel. It's my favorite thing to do. I really want to travel out of the country
2986,"Yeah, I love to travel! Although, I usually go for short stays but move a lot."
2986,That's cool. I need to move. I've been in this town for 20 years. I need a change
2986,I don't blame you! I prefer a much cooler climate like San Francisco or Portland. Where would you move to?
2986,Defiantly Florida. I love the warm weather.  
2986,"I love Floride, been there a few times. They also have incredible beaches."
2986,I saw a blood moon the beach there one time. Amazing.

2987,I won the lottery a few years ago and besides buying a house i splurged on some cars.
2987,"Well seems things worked out for you! I don't play the lottery, feel like with my luck I'd never win anything more than what I lost. "
2987,It was actually a pool at work so i shared it with a lot of people. I don't normally play it by myself.
2987,"Oh nice! Glad it didn't turn into a legal thing, you hear about those every so often. Do you have any pets?"
2987,I have 1 dog named tofu. My husband named it as a joke since it's my least favorite food.
2987,That sounds adorable! I have one dog named Reeces that our kid named after her favorite candy.
2987,"Oh, cute! What kind of dog is it?"
2987,"A boxer! Real sweet to the family, he's about seven or so now."
2987,Mine is a spaniel. It's 10 years old but still looks like a puppy.
2987,Spaniels are great dogs! I had one growing up!
2987,What kind of things do you do for fun?
2988,I from Illinois. I play soccer for a living.
2988,I am from MD it is the state sport there..
2988,"No, I have to travel a lot. But I love it"
2988,"You travel? I love travelling, but have not been able to do so lately. Where have your travels taken you?"
2988,I go everywhere. My favorite is the Bahamas. 
2988,what do you like about the bahamas besides the mangoes ?
2988,The beaches. The water there is amazing. The bluest water I have ever seen. 
2988,"that sounds amazing, I would love to visit there. I probably wouldn't want to leave"
2988,It is hard not to. But I would miss pizza in the states. It's my favorite food. 
2988,"i m a pizza lover so i d have to agree , great food"
2988,Pizza from NYC is my favorite. Chicago's is really good too.
2988,"I've never been to either of those states and haven't really thought of travelling there. But, have you ever tried making your own pizza?"
2989,it seems like i am on a permanet diet that i always break
2989,My personal trainer has really helped me to stay focused. Have you tried consulting with one?
2989,"no i have not, do you know a good one in st augustine?"
2989,"I wish but I am on the Gulf Coast. If you're ever in Houston, I can hook you up with mine. She's incredible. What's your motivation for losing weight?"
2989,"look better, feel better, live longer, no downside unless you go too far which is difficult"
2989,Hhhmmm...  I lost a lot of weight (130 pounds) about 3 years ago following the inspiration of Canadian diabetes specialist Dr. Jason Fung.  
2989,"130 pounds is a lot, i wish i could lose 30 pounds"
2989,"My annual goal is 20 pounds. That's it. If I get halfway there, I'm satisfied. If I beat it, I'm elated."
2989,"elation sounds like fun, i wish i could feel it"
2989,Find your inspiration and keep trying until you find what works for you. I've done a variety but each one gets me closer. 
2989,you are inspiring me to really knuckle down
2989,Yay!  We'll both reach our goals...before we die. hahahaha
2990,Yes. I was because I have not heard from her in some time. 
2990,What led you to be out of touch with her?
2990,My friend tends to shut down at times. She suffers from depression and I always fear when I don't hear from her.
2990,Sorry to hear about that. I hope she is doing alright.
2990,From the letter she is better now. It says shes in India visiting family.
2990,I've always wanted to go there but it may take awhile on a pizzaman's salary. lol.
2990,I hear yah! Between my kids and three cats its hard for me to go on trips.
2990," Me and my brothers sometimes pool money to take trips, Where you like to go if you could go anywhere?"
2990,"I would love to go to Jamaica, Maldives, or Italy. What about you? "
2990,I have always thought about Japan. It looks like a city in the future.
2990,It really does. I would love to go there too. 
2990,It's been really nice talking with you.
2991,8 and 6. They're so adorable.
2991,yes they seem to be
2991,So do you have any great plans for the weekend?
2991,yah having fun with family and friend and u?
2991,Same! We are going to get the new Call of Duty game and order pizza.
2991,Thats great am a fun of call of duty too.
2991,I've heard good things about this year's game. 
2991,Good hear. What is best food?
2991,I like baked chicken with dressing and lots of vegetables. How about you?
2991,i like pizza and juice
2991,Good choice! What toppings do you like on your pizza?
2991,extra cheese
2992,I'm so blessed that way! Now if I could get one to drive me the hour to work every day!
2992,One can only dream! What kind of business are you looking to pursue?
2992,Painting maybe. I really enjoy painting!
2992,"You can use the internet to get your artwork out there. We use it to connect to our patients (I'm a doctor),"
2992,"I always wanted to be a doctor, but, life happened. The internet has enabled so many to connect with others."
2992,Don't feel bad about it. You got the better end of the deal. When I'm not with patients I can't stop thinking about the water.
2992,Maybe you should do a Christmas vacation to the beach?
2992,I wish. We get a lot of folks in town and they often end up in my office. Makes for great inspiration for an artist!
2992,Move your practice to a small rural town in the mountains. I live in a town like that and we don't have a doctor.
2992,You can paint the landscape and I could have all the business! We'd both make a fortune!
2992,I know right! What a great plan!
2992,I'm jealous. I can't paint to save my life. I try to draw and it looks like Picasso. But not on purpose.
2993,"Fried shrimp are the best, homemade because few restaurants can do it right"
2993,I like to run marathons to burn off the bad foods I eat. How about you?
2993,i have never run a marathon and prob never will
2993,Why don't you think you ever will?
2993,"bad knees, bad ankles, 67 yo"
2993,"I see. I don't have bad knees or ankles, but I am 74 years old. I also do some weight lifting."
2993,"sounds like ur in good shape for 74yo,that's  good shape for 30yo"
2993,I am ex military so staying in shape has been beat into me.
2993,"that is really good training, a lifetime of it"
2993,You are right. Are you into any form of exercise?
2993,"i am really into mental exercise and i walk a lot, and think about phys exercise"
2993,Keeping your mind sharp is a great idea. Walking is also god for the body. Good for you.
2994,It is actually. I enjoy growing my own food as well. It quite relaxing. 
2994,"Wow, nice, so I feel like I could ask you your opinion about whether it's a good idea to use farmland for crops or for biofuel."
2994,That's a good question. I think biofuel is a good idea for the environment. 
2995,Its great. There's lots of vendors and music.
2995,I haven't been to a music festival since I was in college! I really miss those days. 
2995,I try to go every year. The burgers there are awesome. They're my favorite.
2995,I like a good burger with a gluten free bun.
2995,They offer gluten free too. One place even dyes their bun red which I love. It's oddly different.
2995,"Oh wow, that sounds fun!! What kind of music is it at this festival?"
2995,There are many different kinds. Some well known performers mixed in with ones just starting out. You can pick your poison
2995,I think I will look around for some festivals that might be coming to my city. 
2995,You should! I'm sure you would really enjoy your self. Music helps the soul.
2995,You have really inspired me this morning.
2995,I love hearing that. I hope you have a great weekend.
2995,"thanks, I hope you have a great weekend too!"
2996,Y say so ?
2996,"I like Nike, its a good products but I do wear others."
2996,yah i like nike shoes alot and caps
2996,Do you wear other products different from Nike?
2996,yah i do
2996,what other products do you wear?
2996,ribock and u 
2996,Ribock as well.
2996,nice 
2996,Have you used Nike sneakers in the past?
2996,yah i have together with my wife and children
2996,oh that's cool.
2997,"Canadian type homie foods, they are quite liberal with the portions."
2997,Sounds good. What dish have you tried there?
2997,"Their poutine is amazing, I haven't really been out much to try new things."
2997,I tend to order the same thing as well. What is poutine?
2997,"It can come in a vast number of variations. Traditionally it's french fries, gravy and cheese curds, but some restaurants have different sauces, and toppings."
2997,"Ah, gotcha. Sounds delicious!"
2998,It's a good thing that Mexican food is not typically seen at a renaissance fair then!
2998,"rofl, yeah.  I love those big turkey drumsticks that they have at Renfaire"
2998,I dressed up in a fancy dress that I customized and dyed from an old used wedding dress. It was fun. 
2998,I haven't been to a RenFair in so long.  I think the last time was back when my wife still liked me.
2998,I bet you could win points by taking her now and buying a giant turkey leg to share and laugh about.
2998,"We used to eat those big turkey legs.  She loves them still, I think.  Just not me."
2998,"Maybe a movie date night would win more points, then. I love getting lost in the screen. What about you?"
2998,"Yeah, lol.  A date would be nice.  But I think she would need to like me before she'd go out.  So, it's just talking, for now."
2998,That can be challenging. I've been there. It's why I go to the movies alone nowadays. hahaha
2998,"lol, yeah, alone can be all right.  At least I can choose where to go eat after.  No mexican for me!"
2998,"I can't imagine no Mexican. I dislike Italian, myself. You and I should take your wife to a... BRAZILIAN STEAK HOUSE! Happiness all around!"
2998,"Yeah!  That sounds awwsome!  Thanks for the idea, man!"
2999,"i have no idea, i need to make some money, any ideas?"
2999,"I am a fulltime nursing student, besides a job im not sure."
2999,no stock tips? easy banks to knock off? jobs are of no interest to me
2999,"Money market funds are very safe, pretty much the same as a bank account, but it offers much more returns"
2999,"dividend growth stocks can be good, some have increased their divs over 50 years straight, which is difficult during hard times"
2999,i do not know anything about the stockmarket .
2999,"stick to great american companiies, JNJ.MMM, MSFT, PG APPL, VZ, and it is hard to go wrong"
2999,thanks i will have to look into it .
2999,"compounded interest adds up, "
2999,It does. Personal finance is so crucial to learn
2999,"it should be mandatory in schools and sports or hollywood, how often do people who made fortunes wind up broke?"
2999,yes! It should be mandatory honestly
3000,I havent either. I feel like they might be becoming obsolete because of Uber and Lyft. 
3000,I don't trust Uber and Lyft... someone in my state was murdered by a fake Uber driver.
3000,That is a main reason I fear them. I dont like the idea of trusting a stranger to take me anywhere. 
3000,I agree. Taxis are licensed and regulated. But your rideshare driver could be anyone.
3000,Exactly. My dad served in the marines and he is still not bold enough to get in a taxi or lyft lol
3000,So do you have any fun plans for the weekend?
3000,I plan to go see a funny movie with my husband. What about you?
3000,I think we will pick up Chinese food and watch some Netflix. We've been watching a Korean soap opera.
3000,I did not know they had Korean soap operas on Netflix. That seems like a good way to learn a language. 
3000,They have lots of them! Even my husband gets really into the drama lol. What movie are you going to see?
3000,Zoombieland Double Tap. Me and my husband are big fans of the first movie. So funny.
3000,I liked Zombieland! I hope you have a good time.
3001,I understand completely. And it's expensive too.
3001,I have a beautiful cat. I would also be leary about the dog & cat coexisting
3001,Oh yeah. I agree. I'm studying social science and I learned that people with cats feel less stressed.
3001,"Yes, having a cat around the house does decrease anxiety and thoughts of uneasiness. "
3001,"I could really use that, but sadly I'm allergic."
3001,What if you purchased a hairless cat? This would help with the allergies
3001,I never thought of that! Then I won't have to stuff myself with pizza when I'm stressed.
3001,"The cat only decreases stress and anxiety, it doesn't completely eliminate it unfortunately."
3001,So I guess I will still have pizza. Lol
3001,"Brickoven, homemade or store bought pizza? Which is your favorite?"
3001,Brickoven no doubt. But I really don't discriminate.
3001,I grew up on store bought pizza. The cheapest you can find. My life changed once I had brick oven.
3002,"I felt bad about it, I would never do something like that again. "
3002,Im glad you learned your lesson!
3002,"I was trying to do something kind for her, but getting a good grade won't help if she doesn't learn from the class on her own."
3002,Yeah. It's tough sometimes. But maybe taught her a valuable lesson?
3002,I hope so! Anyway I am glad to have my school days behind me. 
3002,Did you go to college?
3002,I did! I majored in Art History. How about you?
3002,Im a full time nursing student at the moment.
3002,I know how challenging that is! My neighbor's daughter is a nursing student and she works so hard.
3002,I hope she finishes school.
3002,She is close to graduation I think. 
3002,thats amazing
3003,i love roller coasters do u ?
3003,"Oh yeah, my favorite ride when we go to a park!  I like the ones that go backwards!"
3003,me too i like riding it alot 
3003,Have you ridden on one that has wooden tracks!  They are like old-school thrills.  First roller coaster had wooden rails.
3003,yah i thought i was in the 90s
3003,lol yeah.  The only thing I like better than riding roller coasters is going camping with my family.  Do you go camping?
3003,yah but am starting an interrnship at a construction site next week 
3003,Love bbq!  We cook out every time we go campling.  What are going to cook now?
3003,nothing am thinking about my internship at a construction site next week
3003,"Internship?  Cool, bro, but you don't get paid, right?  Good luck with that!"
3003,thank u alot i do not know if will i will be paid
3003,"Well, whatever makes you happy.  Be happy as much as you can.  Live life, listen to your fave tunes.  I love Bieber.  You got a fave?"
3004,Oh yeah. I was paddling along and saw someone I recognized as a competitive paddler and she was just flying by me!
3004,That's awesome!  I often get scared for them when I see them going so fast.  What if you lost control?
3004,It keeps me in business! lol. I work as an ER Nurse.
3004,"That must be an interesting job!  I'm sure you see way worse on a regular basis.  Thanks for being a nurse, I couldn't do it."
3004,It's cool because no day is the same. What are you into?
3004,For a living? I'm a B2B salesman. For leisure? I recently got into camping which I'm really beginning to like a lot.
3004,"Sales I couldn't do. I never have to sell my patients. Do you want me to fix you're leg? YES! Great, sign here and here."
3004,"HAHA!  Well you ARE in sales to a degree, you just sell a very easy product to sell!  I wish it were as easy on my end!"
3004,True. A lot of times we have to sell people on the idea that they have to cooperate!
3004,I've been that guy before.  I have notoriously difficult veins and had to take a valium once just to calm enough to let them poke around
3004,"Yeah, people have a hard time with needles. We come to expect that."
3004,It's extra traumatizing for me as I've had my ulnar nerve hit before while they were digging around.  You don't forget that pain ever
3005,The debt I am under is soul crushing. I think that a clean break and fresh start is the best option. Where should I go?
3005,Moving is not going to solve your debt problem. Maybe you should speak with a financial adviser 
3005,But I'm failing out of school and I've overspent on my credit cards and I can't afford my car payment and the rent is overdue. 
3005,Have you considered talking to a debt counselor? 
3005,I can't even afford that!  I am soooooo deep in the hole!!!!!!!
3005,Need to work on it a little at a time and it will come together
3005,"You really think so?  Maybe I can find a sugar daddy to help me out. I am really, really cute and fun to be around. "
3005,If only it was that easy
3005,Sigh. You are right. That might help with the rent or car payment. It won't help my in my classes. I can't believe that I'm failing GYM!
3005,"Don't worry, hit the gym and join student clubs."
3005,Clubs?  I bet I could meet lots of great guys there. Thanks. I hope there is a fashion club or a party club.
3005,Just do not be afraid to meet people and make friends.
3006,I do like honey chamomile with ice.
3006,"I've never personally tried that. Have you ever tried bubble tea? It tastes strangely nice, they have the standard tea base but mix it with fruit/milk, and fruit jelly"
3006,I haven't but I really would love too. I've seen different recipes.
3006,"you might like it, usually they have a removable lid for the tea preperation and a handle is helpful too"
3006,Maybe I will pick one up on my next hike and save it for the top. I love sitting and seeing the land below.
3006,I love hiking and the wilderness. I am a carpenter so i like to be influenced by nature.
3006,I love it too. I'm scared of heights but their is just something calming about the outdoors.
3006,Yes i had a wedding ceremony outdoors.
3006,That's sounds lovely. I bet it was beautiful.
3006,"It was especially since it was the first warm weekend of the year. Often, picnics are family-oriented but this was with close friends."
3006,It's warm here most of the year.
3006,It is where I am too! It is starting to get cooler now but still great outdoor weather. 
3007,"He is so excited, he just made the varsity track team!"
3007,That's great! Congratulations to him! You must be very proud.
3007,He is quite the athlete.  Did you play sports in high school?
3007,"I wasn't very athletic, I was in the art club and drama club. I didn't appreciate exercise until I was an adult."
3008,That
3008,Do you have a favorite club band in california?
3008,"Sorry for my fat fingers because I meant to say that was cool.  As for my favorite club bands, probably LA Guns!"
3008,Never heard of them. Looking forward to going to san diego one day. heard is nice
3008,"It's beautiful.  I wish I could enjoy my time there more, but I have been working so many hours lately."
3008,What are some main attractions there besides the zoo??
3008,"They have a number of great museums, but I would recommend walking the Embarcadero, or taking in a Padres game."
3008,Big baseball fan. My astros are on the ropes now. Heard the downtown area this is nice also.
3008,It's beautiful.  Well the Nationals are playing great ball right now.  Do you have any kids?
3008,"Yes, only 2 small girls. They are going fast. And you?"
3008,"I have three kids myself, but you know that my kids can't stand any Californian baseball teams?!?"
3008,Are you planning to grow your family more? I would like a son.
3008,"I think I am done, but it's a blast watching them grow older."
3009,When is tthe best time to go?
3009,I would say in the warmer seasons. But Las Vegas doesnt have the harshest winter. It might be a great visit anytime of year. 
3009,"iwould like to go during march madness or halloween, i heard it gets really wild then"
3009,Why have I never thought of that. Its almost Halloween. Do you have plans?
3009,"I already have plans, but i have heard they have a HUUUGE halloween party with lots of adult fun"
3009,Yes Vegas seems so fun. I want to move there one day. 
3009,"Visit there in summer first, it is incredibly hot March thru october"
3009,I will. thanks for the suggestion . have you been there before ?
3009,"yes i have, betting parlays on college football is fun, if giving money away is fun"
3009,I love sports i might try my hand in betting on some teams. 
3009,it will break your heart and your wallet
3010,"oh I like pecans, they are one of my favorites"
3010,Pecans?  I haven't had a pecan in forever but now I'm suddenly craving some on a sundae.  I never did like pecan pie though...
3010,"yea, I can have it as a topping or eat it plain. Wouldn't enjoy it much on a pie"
3011,"I have black boots, they're leather. I usually wear lots of leather."
3011,"I like leather jackets. Being a dude, I feel every dude should have one. Like James Dean. I', into old movies."
3011,"I agree, they should be a staple. They're a timeless fashion piece. What kind of turtles do you have?"
3011,They are these big tortoises. They showed up in my backyard one day and I started feeding them fruits and veggies!
3011,"Oh wow, that's awesome! My friend has a few turtles, but they aren't big."
3011,I named them Leonardo and Donatello!
3012,Nothing yet - just a pipe dream
3012,Oh that's a great dream to have! 
3012,What do you want to do in space? Be an astronaut or just a tourist?
3012,"Actually, the thought of leaving planet earth terrifies me. lol While space is a boundless three-dimensional extent I prefer to keep my flip flops on my home planet."
3012,Not a bad idea. Do you have any kids?
3012,"No I don't, but maybe one day. What is your favorite food?"
3012,Pizza! I love pizza made all different ways.
3012,I like pizza. But I love lasagna. I love it like Garfield. 
3012,Hahaha Garfield is ridiculous. Do you like comics?
3012,I don't like comics. But I really like magicians. My favorite are Penn and Teller 
3012,Those guys are great. I love the magicians on America's Got Talent.
3013,"Wow, thanks for the empathy!  I live in a small city--it's tough to find any job around here."
3013,am originaliy from londan england what about u?
3013,"USA, born and bred.  Never been out of the country.  Maybe when the kids are fully grown and gone."
3013,good to hear london is has alot of good things 
3013,"Yeah, I heard that, too.  I love their accents.  So fancy!"
3013,yah so fancy in deed. do u like camping ?
3013,I do!  The kids and I go camping whenever we can.  Cheap and fun.  Do you like s'mores?
3013,i do. i love the sand
3013,Sand?  So you camp on the beach!  The kids and I love to go swimming.  You build sand castles?
3013,Yes I do and some beaches have man made stuff on them like life guard sheds
3013,"lol, like on TV, do the lifeguards run in slow motion and are insanely attractive?"
3013,Yes I am an ok swimmer enough to keep me alive lol I got those survival skills.
3014,I really enjoy going to classical music concerts 
3014,That sounds like a wonderful experience. I would love to go to the symphony someday. 
3014,I have never travel out of the country. I think it would be so nice to classical music concert over seas.
3014,I have spent some time in England. I didn't get to go to any concerts but I visited some amazing museums.
3014,I would also like to go to ireland and hike the land 
3014,"Me too, or Scotland. There is so much beautiful scenery in those areas."
3014,Yes that would be lovely 
3014,Do you have any plans to travel soon?
3014,I have looking into it. I would like to do it soon
3014,I hope you are able to! Do you have any fun weekend plans?
3014,Going to a Halloween Party.Do you ?
3014,Are you wearing a costume? I'll be ordering pizza and watching movies with my husband. 
3015,It makes me feel like I don't belong anymore cause I miss that time.
3015,I know what you mean. I wish my dad were still around.
3015,It makes me sad but it helps to write my thoughts down. It's like a release.
3015,Do you write poetry or stories?
3015,I guess it could be poetry. I just write down thoughts. Sometimes it is very random.
3015,The best ideas come from random thoughts. Thats what my mother taught me when i was homeschooled and had to write stories for english. 
3015,That makes sense. Your mom sounds like a smart woman.
3015,haha she is. how is your family?
3015,I'm the oldest and we were pretty close. I don't see my siblings much anymore.
3015,oh that has to be rough . family is important .
3015,"Yes it is,"
3015,Family is important but they sometimes make me want to scream lol
3016,"I actually only have one, but I'm just a college student and my apartment is really small."
3016,college is sucha fun time. I currently work at a bank as i went to school for finance. 
3016,"I am actually in business school right now, but I do work on the side at a daycare so I'm considering something in education."
3016,Kudos to you. Dealing and teaching young children is stressful but rewarding.
3016,"Just the other day one girl smiled at me and gave me a hug for the first time, I almost cried!"
3016,"Aww, that's is adorable. Children are so sweet and innocent. "
3016,Do you have any?
3016,I have two girls. A two year old and an 8 month old. 
3016,"Aw, I can't wait to have children!  I bet they are a real blessing for you."
3016,"They are, I am so thankful for them! Thankful to have divorced my oldest dad before she was born too."
3016,Was it a bad situation?
3016,Not really just we grew apart he wasnt trying to do anything productive in life.
3017,Oh wow! Nice.  What made you fall in love with them?
3017,Not sure? Our relationship came about as an extension of our friendship. How about you?
3017,I like to keep my guard up.  No love here.  I did do some educational testing as a child.
3017,"That's great. I'm a native spaker, but from what I understand English is very hard to actually learn"
3018,"Yes, love filipino cuisine."
3018,That's cool. Do they refer to themselves as 
3018,"No, i dont believe so. What is your favorite filipino dish?"
3018,"Tandoori, for sure. How about you? Do you like Indian food? Or any other kind of ethnic food?"
3018,Im a tandoori fan as well. I like some indian food. Not all
3018,"I love delicious foods more so teri yaki, so yummy."
3018,Can wait to have some this weekend. How about you
3018, there's filipino restaurant that just opened close to where I live can't wait to take my kids there
3018,Have you ever heard of soulfood?
3018,I haven't but that might be a good idea for me to try out!
3018,Southern US cuisine generally originated around slavery times. Really good stuff
3018,thanks ! i will have to check it out !
3019,Have you ever been to Alpine Skiing resort ?
3019,"A couple of times. I was on a ski team when I was younger, so we traveled to a few."
3019,"Oh, I bet you are a really good skier. I just started skiing about a year ago."
3019,It's a fun sport to get into! I'm sure you're doing really well.
3019,I have see alot of post on social media about skiing and that is how I got interested in it.
3019,Do you live close to places you can ski? I have to drive for a couple of hours to get to any.
3019,"I have one that is about a hour away , but it seems to always be packed because that is the only one close here."
3019,"I know how that is, it can be frustrating. What other kinds of things do you enjoy doing?"
3019,"I love to hike , especially this time of year with the leaves changing."
3019,It's a beautiful time of year to be outdoors.
3019,Fall and Winter are my favorite season. I seem to post a lot of pictures on social media for fall and winter. 
3019,I prefer colder weather myself. The summers are pretty unbearable here.
3020,they came from texas
3020,I love Texas!!
3020,"they really enjoyed the Alamo, They knew very little about it, now they know a lot"
3020,I bet they did. Who doesn't like the Alamo!! Nice to know they had a great time 
3020,"as a state texas has a lot of pride, lone stars everywhere, even stamped into the concete of overpasses,i love it"
3020,Who doesn't!! Another great place is California!
3020,"cal seems to have a lot of probs, nowadays, homelessness, fires, eloectricity, debt"
3021,I just retired from the military so this is my first civilian job. What do you do?
3021,I'm a role player for a law enforcement training facility.  They practice holds and strikes on me while I try to fight back.
3021,That sounds pretty intense. Do you enjoy it?
3021,"Well the pays good obviously, and I like that I'm training sheriffs and other law enforcement o be better at their jobs."
3021,That's pretty cool. You are doing good work.
3021,"Yeah, thanks. I used to do criminal defense but was lucky that I got to switch to civil matters. I got sick of defending guilty people."
3021,I would imagine that would wear on you after a while.
3021,"Yeah. People judge the merits and faults of my work. I get a little sensitive about it sometimes, but I'll get over it."
3021,"I think that's true of everyone, you know? We've all got to be thick skinned."
3021,"i guess . i just have to have the acceptance , i guess ."
3021,Acceptance is the answer to all of my problems today!
3021,"so true! cant ask for anymore , lol ."
3022,"I think so, but it's hard to prove."
3022,That's too bad it can't be proved. How did you hear about this injustice?
3022,A colleague heard her talking about it. She's boasting about it outside of work.
3022,That's not very classy of her. Would you ever hire your sister?
3022,"If she was suitable for the role, but she wouldn't like to work here. She prefers the outdoors"
3022,I don't think I could work with my family members. I also prefer to work outdoors. Why don't you?
3022,"I like the outdoors, but for other reasons. Running and writing outside. But I find it too cold to work outdoors."
3022,"It's cold yes, I just wear more layers. I find it oppressive being trapped inside behind a desk all day. "
3022,It's tough but I find my work rewarding so it helps. Plus I get to look outside all day
3022,Well at least you get a window. Perhaps I should start looking for a job that lets me be outside. 
3022,What do you do for a living?
3022,Data Entry. You?
3023,Pizza has been around a lot longer than I would have thought
3023,"My kids love pizza. But then again, who doesn't!"
3023,I love Pizza too my favorite toppings are pepperoni and bacon on thin crust. what are your favorite toppings?
3023,Ham and black olives! The kids are just pepperoni so we usually get one of each.
3023,I feel like ham and black olives is something you arrive at by picking what you don't like off of a supreme pizza haha!
3023,Yeah. Supreme has so much going on. It's like a painting!
3023,"I like supreme too.  Its like a guilty pleasure though because i can never commit to buying it, i only eat it when it shows up"
3023,"I'm fortunate that my work allows me a lot of time with my kids, so we try to mix it up and add tacos and barbecues."
3023,"That's awesome, i don't have kids but my work affords me a lot of home time since i work from home.  What do you do for a living?"
3023,"I work as a safety manager for an airplane parts manufacturer. I make sure equipment is working, standards are maintained, and run training."
3023,Oh wow that sounds like a pretty cool job.  I do B2B sales in transportation.
3023,"What kind of transport? Cars, trains, planes?"
3023,"Full truckload, warehousing, import/export, railroad, and sprinter vans s what we typically use"
3024,"Yes it has been rough for me. My wife hates me, she thinks im lazy and poor. "
3024,I could imagine. I hope you're able to work through this somehow.
3024,"Me too, maybe if i told her i won the lottery six years ago she would understand why i stopped working but still pay the bills. "
3024,i bet . be patient though . i am sure this is hard enough for her .
3024,yes she was very close to my cousin. i should do something to cheer her up
3024,you are a good person ! she will be very happy with you .Go ahead and do that
3024,i will thank you 
3024,You're welcome.  I wish you the best!
3024,You as well. have you ever lost someone close to you?
3024,yes . it was pretty devastating . but we will pull together and be stronger .
3024,yes staying positive is important. thats what im telling myself.
3024,we have to keep pushing through though . we can do it !
3025,I got my degree in accounting. 
3025,"That's a useful degree to have, and tax season is coming up soon."
3025,Yes it is but I am going back to college because I want to get my teaching degree. So I can be a math teacher.
3025,That's good. I was never very good at math in school.
3025,My family migrated to American when I was five and since then I have had a passion for math and problem solving. 
3025,I really admire that. Not being good at math has been frustrating for me at times. 
3025,What do you do?
3025,I'm a librarian! I work in the teen services department.
3025,I bet that is interesting.
3025,Some days it is! And some days the kids just want to come in and play games on the computers.
3025,"That is the only problem with teens, the love the video games more than reading a good book."
3025,It seems like kids are always glued to some kind of device!
3025,"Nice talking to you , have a good day"
3026,"Oh, really! That's awesome. How was it back then? I love watching the new star trek series while eating pretzels."
3026,"The series is great, it had some amazing music too."
3026,Cool. Do you watch the Star Trek: Discovery series? I love it
3026,Oh yeah! I am a fan. Star Trek is an American tv show created by Gene Roddenberry.
3026,I am a fan too. There is a rumor that the Season 3 of that series will be canceled. I will be so sad if it's true
3026,"Oh well, if they cancel it, they will find another show to work on."
3026,"Yeah, true! We can stick to the old Star Trek series anyway. So, who is your favorite character. I love Spock. He is amazing"
3026,"I like Kirk, he had weird quirks about himself that I relate too. I've been pretty busy lately taking walks, I love it!"
3026,"Kirk is my second favorite. Oh, that's good for you. Do you walk everyday? Is there any goal that you try to complete?"
3026,I'm working towards competing in a marathon next year in Boston. So far I've qualified.
3026,"Awesome! Good to hear that. I hope you will be able to complete the marathon and maybe bring some medal. Someday, I would love to join too. "
3026,"Thank you very much, it can be difficult to learn to run properly when you haven't had the sufficient training."
3027,"Yea, i agree. I'm not too much on superhero movies...I like musicals, reality tv, old shows. "
3027,For sure. I'd rather go fishing. What's your favorite old show?
3027,"oh there are too many, Three's Company, Green Acres, Petticoat Junction, H.R. Puff n Stuff, love the X-files. Brady Bunch. Just watched Brady Renovations"
3027,I'll need to check that out! 
3027,They took the house we all thought it was filmed in and gutted it down to the frame and made it into the brady house down to the door knobs
3027,"Down to the door knobs? Wow. I need them to do my house since I am always gone, being a paramedic."
3027,"It was mind blowing, they got all 6 brady kids to come help with renovation. Exactly they can come gut my house and redo it. Paramedic wow, respect"
3027,"tough job , but i appreciate it ! well , it was nice chatting with you !"
3027,very respectable job. Very nice chatting with you as well. 
3027,This was the most fun chat Ive had today. Enjoy yur day!
3027,Same here and it's not even 8:30am my time hahah
3027,"yeah , no kidding , i didn't go to bed until 2am here ."
3028,"I love to write. I am in school for journalism, as I like to write editorials and opinion pieces."
3028,That's awesome!  I always fancied myself as a writer (because I enjoy doing it) but I never really did much of it outside of school.
3029,My two cats get so scared in bad storms and I feel so awful.
3029,"Yes, cats can be difficult to take care of when they are agitated by environmental things. "
3029,"This may sound weird, but what really soothes them is if I read to them."
3029,That is interesting. my cats hate the rain. but they are still great with my two beautiful boys. do you have kids?
3029,"No, but my fur babies give me everything I need right now. How many cats do you have?"
3029,we have two cats they stay at my mothers when my family goes camping every month
3029,Sounds so exciting.  Where do you camp at?
3029,I used to go someplace in Phoenix area.  It was a long time ago. Now we go to the mountains in Tennessee 
3029,It sounds beautiful!  Have you always been avid campers?
3029,I have since I was little. 
3029,"I think I was 12 the last time I went camping, but there was a storm just like the other night."
3029,"Hopefully it's not a big one that would cause serious damage, I assume? Otherwise, I kind of like storms"
3029,"It was a little scary, but our tents held up and I stayed dry overnight."
3030,"Oh, awesome! I need to try this Yoga"
3030,Yes look into it it is great for you also look into Hatha yoga and Raja yoga they are very well known.
3030,Awesome. I have never heard of those. Do you participate in Yoga?
3030,"Yes, I work on trucks so my muscles get really knotted up and the stretching helps a lot!"
3030,That's great! I live in a big city so I'm sure I can find some classes around here somewhere and maybe sometimes I could go to yoga classes
3030,Yes you should check it out! What are your hobbies?
3030,"I like sewing, dancing, and baking. Yours?"
3030,I love to read and take naps! I don't have a lot of free time though.
3030,"I really don't either with my kids but when I do have free time, napping is always GREAT!! ha"
3030,Especially when you have kids!! 
3030,"Well, thanks for the great conversation about yoga. I learned two new styles to try someday"
3030,Yep nice talking to you!
3031,Her last birthday card.  
3031,So you knew she wouldn't find it?
3031,"Yeah, I watched her open it when as soon as she got it in the mail.  She took out the money from our Grandma and tossed the card."
3031,"she should save the card, all of her birthday cards and look at them when she is old"
3031,"Yeah, totally agree.  Memories, man.  She sometimes keeps them to use as a bookmark for her fave romance novels.  I'm into horror novels.  You?"
3031,i like nonfiction. what did sis do when she learned you used her credit card?
3031,"What??  I never said that.  And I only did it once, and she never found out.  How did you know?"
3031,"i suppose i am psychic, i hear voices in my head sometimes"
3031,"Or you're clinically insane.  Either works for me.  You got a crystal ball or prescription meds to go with your ""power""?"
3031,"i have maryann williams crystals, i stole them from backstage during the debate"
3031,"rofl, that's a riot.  You a klepto, too?"
3031,sometimes i can
3032,Yea... alot more then people know
3032,I see a lot of suffering in ny. Eventually I think you just get numb to it. 
3032,it's easy to gloss over
3032,"I don't know if we really stop noticing. It effects our art, our culture, our belief systems. Do you agree?"
3032,yes... but I think your average person doesn't think about it on a day to day basis
3032,"True, it just lays dormant in our subconscious. Did you enjoy psychology in school?"
3032,kinda... it was a little too dense for me at times
3032,Do you ever regret your career? I know I do.
3032,sometimes but I don't know what i would do instead
3032,"If you could choose any career, money and time is no option, what would it be?"
3032,musician
3032,That would be amazing. What instruments can you play?
3033,What is your dog doing?
3033,Running and chewing on everything. I can't keep good furniture.
3033,Hmm. Have you tried a shock collar? You could lightly tone them everytime they start acting out?
3033,That would be a little scary. I'm not sure about that. I will put her outside when the rain stops.
3033,"I can understand that feeling. Yeah this rain is bad, though it makes office work a little less dull."
3033,It is dying down a bit. I'll be able to take her out this morning to enjoy the outdoors
3033,"That'll be good for her. I'm glad its slowing down. I have to help my father in law unload some produce later, so it'll be nice to be dry."
3033,What kind of produce? Does he own a business?
3033,Yeah he owns a grocery out in the country. I think he is getting a shipment of apples from a nearby farm.
3033,Sweet. Does he sell all of them? How much goes to waste?
3033,"He actually does sell most of it. Some will likely go to waste, but its generally not a lot. Especially Friday shipments"
3033,Thats cool. I'd imagine they are expensive to buy in large quantities.
3034,Mine lives just down the street from me. We should go to country music festivals. Suggestions?
3034,The Creamfields dance music festival. They have the best live acts.
3034,Nice. Will check it out. Maybe I can load up the old Honda Civic and go!
3034,How do you like the Honda Civic? I have a dodge.
3034,"It won't die. I used to have a dodge, but paid for repairs a lot. How about you?"
3034,Just got my Dodge repaired. Its a little Caliber. I'll probably get a Honda next time.
3034,"Yeah, can't go wrong. My friend can fix cars sometimes, so it's good to know someone!"
3034,I've got a good mechanic. My car is orange! I don't like orange.
3034,LOL. Not many orange cars. Maybe call it Burnt Sienna?
3034,I call it Mango Tango. But I don't like Mangoes either! Ha!
3034,That's the best name I've ever heard! Thanks for the laugh. Maybe I should name my white civic? Any ideas?
3034,Marshmallow delight?
3035,Do you like to read? I am in publishing so I read a lot.
3035,Yes I love it! It's such a useful tool for creativity and analysis of ideas. What type of books do you like? Maybe I can give a suggestion.
3035,"I love historical fiction, memoirs and light hearted mysteries. What are your favorite genres?"
3035,"I love mysteries, but lately I've been reading the Berenstain Bears books, at the insistence of my child! They're illustrated children's novels like those in the "
3035,I remember reading those as a child! 
3035,I've been surprised how much I've loved them. what have you been reading lately?
3035,I've been reading a lot of graphic novels. Mostly the updated version of the Babysitter's Club. They are for kids but I really enjoy them.
3035,That sounds great! I should look in too them more.
3035,I love graphic novels
3035,i think they're great as well .
3035,Graphic books are a great way to read history as well.
3035,I agree! There is so much we can learn from recovering and analyzing material culture!
3036,"yes, love it when you do don't have to worry about hurricanes"
3036,The west coast does have to worry about earthquakes though. And wildfires.
3036,"oh yea, can't imagine living there. It's heart wrenching watching what they go through each time"
3036,Further up north is pretty good though. Oregon and Washington State are really nice.
3036,"oh really, I haven't been there before"
3036,"Oregon is beautiful! I have been to Portland before, and I love MT. Hood, and the city is really interesting. A lot different from the east."
3036,"Wow, you are making me think of visiting there when next I take vacation. Will surely give it a look in"
3036,"Its a very walkable city with great public transportation, so you wouldn't even have to rent a car. I absolutely loved it."
3036,"Thanks for the info, it's interesting to know what to expect when traveling to an unknown place"
3036,"Depending on where you are on the east coast, the people move at a much more relaxed pace. It's a great vacation to lower your stress."
3036,"okay, that sounds like it will work for me. Like I said will plan my vacation around the places you recommended. thanks once again"
3036,It's my pleasure. Knowledge is meant to be shared. Life's too short not to enjoy it.
3036,"that's right, thank you some much for the insight"
3036,Of course. I hope you have a good trip.
3037,"Yes, we have been married for 20 years now and still love each other very much."
3037,"That's a long time, it must be a nice feeling. I'd like to have that too, I have a co-worker that I see everyday, I have a crush o nher."
3037,Have you ever told her you have a crush on her?
3037,It gives me anxiety thinking about telling her I have a crush on her.
3037,I love rock music and go to concerts often.Find out what kind of music she likes and invite her to a concert. 
3037,"I prefer to play tabletop games at home, usually with my friends. Have you listen to the newest Bring Me The Horizon album?"
3037,"No I have not , is it good "
3037,Yes. I love their music. I think my co-worker loves them.
3037,See that would be a good starting point for a conversation. 
3037,"I feel happy chatting with her, it helps with my anxiety when I think about letting her know I love her."
3037,Taking it slow sometimes is the best way. But at some point you are going to have to ask her out before its to late
3037,"You're right, maybe I'll invite her over to play tabletop games. Thanks so much for your support."
3037,"Nice talking with you , have a good day"
3038,"I have my cats, which helps. "
3038,"i have cats also, they are my kids haha. They do help with lonliness and feeling alone, no one should have to feel that way. I have been there"
3038,"It can be hard, but, I also have lived with people that didn't respect my space and that was way worse."
3038,"absoluetely. I would rather be alone, feel alone, that have to deal with people who doesn't respect me and my feelings. "
3038,"Do you like to read? I would be lost with my books-or Kindle, rather."
3038,"Not a big fan of it. Unless I can find a book that grabs my attention from the first page, Only one book has done that for me"
3038,"I love to read, but, so many times a book sounds amazing and then bores me to tears."
3038,"not really unless i find a book that grabs my attention on the first page, and only book has done that for me"
3038,"I like very dark, post apocalyptic stuff."
3038,"a lot of people are. I like autobiographies, true stories, but i do love a good mystery, crime story. i also like reading christian books"
3038,I love true crime stuff-books and tv shows.
3038,yes! I can't get enough of medical shows. like Dr. G medical examiner...i love watching her do autopsies and i love trying to figure out how they died. 
3039,The best part of tailgating is that I get to hang out with old friends.
3039,My favorite part about tailgating is the food. Barbecue in particular.
3039,Oh Yes! A guy I used to hang out with made the best BBQ Chicken. It was AMAZING
3039,I'm a beef rib fan. Also big fan of smoked sausage.
3039,Those are good too. Have you ever tried ribs smoked instead of BBQ?
3039,"Yes, im from texas so in anyway you can imagine, I've had them."
3039,Oh you would know much better then me then lol. Midwestern BBQ is not as well known as Texas BBQ 
3039,"Correct, you have a few bbq hubs around US. Texas, Memphis and Kansas."
3039,"Memphis and Texas I knew, but Kansas? That's news to me."
3039,"Yes, Kansas City in particular is one of the most popular places in US for BBQ"
3039,"Huh. That guy that made the Chicken was originally from Kansas, so that makes sense now. "
3039,"Yes, back to tailgating. Our local team here is the most popular team for tailgating in all sports."
3039,Oh yeah? What makes them stand out?
3040,Gotcha. Maybe I should just stick to virtual hiking on account of my being a famous video game character.
3040,Maybe you could find a short trail somewhere - but you do have to walk or ride a bike since motorized activity is significantly restricted.
3040,"I've done bright angel trail, but only the first mile and half. What's another good hike?"
3040,There is Florida National Scenic Trail. It has great scenery and runs through Big Cypress National Preserve.
3040,"Sweet. I'll check it out, and maybe engineer some gear to go along with my internship."
3040,Would you be going with any other people?
3040,Sure. I think that is safer. Right?
3040,"Yes, it would be for sure. I used to go with my older siblings. "
3040,"Family is the best. Though sometimes it can be stressful, especially while hiking!"
3040,That is very true! Do you hike with your family?
3040,"Yes, I'd rather hike with them than anyone else."
3040,Where do you guys like to hike?
3041,"i am not sure, i like 80's music a lot nowadays"
3041,"I used to be into the screamo scene as a teen, but I got out of it. I'm indie all the way. "
3041,"i really enjoyed the various sound tracks on the vodeo game, grand theft auto vice city"
3041,I hate that game. Zelda sound tracks are amazing though. Do you go to the symphony?
3041,i have only been once and i slept thru barber of seville
3041,I've only seen the loony tunes version of that. It was pretty epic though. 
3041,"i agree, some of disney cartoons with classical music are great"
3041,Agreed. Did you know Sleeping Beauty was all music by Tchaikovsky. He is hands down my favourite classical composer. 
3041,"did not know that, i enjoyed the music near the end of soylent green at e g robinsons death"
3041,"I have never seen that. My dad loved that movie though, talked about it all the time. "
3041,"you should watch it, it takes place in 2021(next year) and was made in 1970's, that was their version of the future,"
3042,"We named ours Pineapple and Ham, my favorite pizza toppings. Besides my cats Pizza is my favorite thing. "
3042,I love that!! Super creative and it shows how much you must love your cat!! Did you adopt your cat as well
3042,"I do love them, they're my world. I adopted them from the shelter."
3042,That is very sweet. I take adoptions to heart as I was an orphan. I bet your cat really loves the attention you give it
3042,"They do, as soon as I get home they're all over me. I also have a pitbull that I adopted as well. They go crazy when I get home."
3042,"Oh I know your pitbull likes attention. Being an orphan, you want people to notice you. I sure want people notice me. "
3042,I can see that. I'm kind of low key and don't want people to notice me. 
3042,YOU: I kinda wish I was that way but I throw myself at people. I guess I missed that part of my childhood where I was noticed by parents
3042,"Yeah, parental neglect and attention can shape a child's life."
3042,"Yes, i just hope I'm a good parent to my children. I'm trying to be the best, honestly. "
3042,I'm sure you are. Do you listen to music?
3042,I love music! It keeps me going. Do you? Any favorite artists?
3042,I'm a huge Dream Theater fan!
3043,I love to travel. How about you?
3043,"Yeah, I love to travel! Although, I usually go for short stays but move a lot."
3043,What's the most interesting place you have been?
3043,I think I would say India.... it's very different than America!
3043,"Oh yes, the culture is so different there. I really enjoyed visiting China."
3043,I've always wanted to go there! What did you like most about it?
3043,"The food. ""american"" Chinese food is a joke! Authentic food is where it's at."
3043,i've heard that! What's so different about it?
3043,They don't use sugar or thick sauces. It's just a unique and delicious set of flavors.
3043,i bet it is better than the american stuff !
3043,You should seek out an authentic Chinese restaurant in your area. Try bao!
3043,i've heard good things but never been
3044,Yummy! What did you bring?
3044,"I brought potato salad and hot dogs.  I always bring too much, though!"
3044,Bringing too much is always better than not enough! Do you watch a game after? 
3044,"We tailgate at the game.  I want to tailgate at the Super bowl, but I'd have to fly there-I've never flown.  Have you?"
3044,"Yes I have it isn't as bad as you would think, and makes your trip more enjoyable"
3044,"I love the Super Bowl commericals, too!  But I usually miss them, tailgating at the local stadium with friends."
3044,They are the greatest! I would love to see the halftime show live! 
3044,me too!  I want to see what gets cut-out from TV coverage
3044,Right that's always what I have wondered about too! 
3044,"Man, I could talk forever about sports!  There's so much to say and so little time, lol"
3044,Very true! What is your favorite team?
3044,Cowboys!  Are there really any other teams out there?  lol
3045,Close to a Six Flags.  They have the best roller coasters!
3045,I think the roller coasters are my favorite thing.
3045,Mine too.  I love the ones that go upside down and really fast
3045,"The only ones I'm not crazy about are the ones that go SUPER high, or have jerky turns. "
3045,"The old wooden ones are great, but I can only take them in small bursts.  They jerk my neck too much."
3045,"I don't mind the wooden ones so much, but there's that crazy mouse or wild mouse at Dorney Park in Pennsylvania that I hate. Whiplash is never fun."
3045,I've never been there.  I'll have to check it out.  
3045,"It's probably not the best amusement park of all time, but the Talon was my favorite coaster there. It's been a while, I don't know what's new."
3045,"Some of my favorite ones are at Kings Island in Cincinnati.  They're tearing down one of the best ones though, the Vortex.  I hated to hear that. "
3045,"That one's not too far from me, but I've never been. I'll check that one out while you check out Dorney and we'll compare notes!"
3045,Sounds good!
3045,"I'll have to try and find someone to go with - I have such a pathetic social life, I don't know if any friends would want to go."
3045,"Several of mine don't like coasters, but I have some who do.  My sister will usually go with me. "
3046,Its nice one. 
3046,My favorite Chainsmokers song is Sick Boy.
3046,Oh I also hear many time that song. 
3046,"Awesome, what else are you in to?"
3046,I am in to home to hear this. 
3046,"I am as well. I used to be in college, but I dropped out to go to pilot school."
3046,Why man?
3046,College just wasn't for me I guess.
3046,Okay man. 
3046,I fly for Spirit most of my career.
3046,Wow that is spirit. Keep it up man. 
3046,I will try my best.
3047,I have several small dogs.
3047,i have 2 a chow and pitbull who are scared of their own shadows
3047,"My two are mixed dogs, I adopted them from the animal shelter. I feel in love with them as soon as I seen them"
3047,dogs are great treat them right they will be your best friends for life
3047,I am planning on retiring in 6 months and I want to do a rescue shelter for dogs.
3048,I was put on bedrest because of some minor complications.  The worst part is that I can't have tacos.  They're my favorite!
3048,I love tacos too twice a week sometimes.
3048,You're making me hungry!  lol
3048,Taco tuesday has been my soul since i was born.
3048,I can't wait until this baby gets here and I can start having them again.  I really have to keep my mind occupied while I'm on bedrest. 
3049,"Yes, extremely relaxing. But painful."
3049,"Yeah it really is, but we try our best if that is likely to minimize the pain."
3049,What strategies do you use to stop the pain (minimize)?
3049,I don't push myself too far. Just stretch until you are slightly uncomfortable and then the next time do a little more.
3049,I see. I'd prefer running and HIT instead but different things works for different people
3049,that it does . each to their own though .
3049,Do you instruct yoga sessions?
3049,No but I would love to! I am very busy with my kids. Do you have kids.
3049,"Yes, 2 girls. Hope to have a boy"
3049,I have two boys myself! I feel like two kids is the perfect amount. Not too much to drive you insane and just enough so your first isn't lonely.
3049,Do you want girls?
3049,No. 2 is enough for me and my wife :)
3050,i love south park 
3050,It is the best show ever made ever in life ever lol
3050,yes its funny i like the fat child with the red shirt
3050,Cartman! You better respect his AU-THOR-A-TIE! LOL He's my favorite!
3050,haha! nice one . did you know he uses offensive words?
3050,The whole show is offensive. I guess that's mostly the humor in it.
3050,yes and what would you think the pg rating would be for this show?
3050,Not at all. I would think M for Mature.
3050,"yes, but is it airing on adultswim?"
3050,I believe it is. It's the later evening shows on cartoon network.
3050,"ahh i see, cartoon network  ? but kids watch that too!"
3050,Yeah I want to say it's more targeted towards the teenage and young adult audience. 
3051,"Yeah it was the worst...hearing her cry made my heart drop. I can still remember getting shots when I was younger, can you?"
3051,Yes! I was terrified of shots. And still hate them today!
3051,"I actually went the other day to get some blood work done, and I had the same feeling of anxiousness "
3051,"Yes, I feel the same when I have to get blood work. A needle is a needle..."
3051,I can't imagine having to be the technician that has to do all the blood work and give all the shots
3051,Yes - that  would not be a job I'd like. 
3051,What do you do?
3051,I work for an executive search firm. How about you?
3051,i'm a government contractor.
3051,That sounds like a good job with nice benefits. 
3051,"I like it a lot, been with my company for awhile now, so I really can't complain. How did you get into working at an executive search firm?"
3051,"The company is a client of my husband's firm, so when they needed someone, I was told about the job."
3052,Do you know the history of Nascar?
3052,"No, I really dont follow sports much."
3052,It has its roots in prohibition when boot leggers would soup up thier cars to smuggle alchohol
3052,That is really interesting! When did it become a sport?
3052,I'm not sure but I know that it was pretty organized by the 50's and 60's
3052,That is really interesting.
3052,Do you follow any sports? 
3053,I lost both of my parents at a very young age.
3053,"im so sorry to hear that, im sure it never gets any easier"
3053,"It's all okay, it was a struggle at first. But I've turned to my higher power and know that everything happens for a reason."
3053,You have to be brave also. Keep thinking ahead. What is your higher power?
3053,The good lord is my higher power. He keeps me sane every single day. lol 
3053,Its good your staying positive. a good chat and a cup of tea always seems to help
3053,Most defiantly I'm also a big tea drinker at night. I'm also a big gym go'er also. The gym keeps my stress down1
3053,I really enjoy tea. I try and get to the gym. and always have hard boiled eggs after it. how often do you go?
3053,"Nice! Eating defiantly plays an important role. And I'm in the gym every day, for a minimum of two hours. lol"
3053,Lol! Good workout though! i think two hours would be too much. i Try for 1.5 hours and it tires me
3053, I say that laughing because I can barely walk right now from squats yesterday.
3053,"Squats, bench, Deadlift and hard boiled eggs. The key to success"
3053,Exactly!! I found a chat buddy that actually has some work out knowledge! 
3054,i tend to worry a lot especially about my family
3054,Do they have issues that cause you to worry or are you just very close with each other?
3054,they are old and sick and i dont have anyone else
3054,Do you get to spend a lot of time with them?
3054,not anymore i moved about three hours away
3054,Aw I'm sorry to hear that!  Do you have any hobbies that keep you busy or allow you to meet new people?
3054,i play videogames but nobody wants to be my friend for some reason. i called someone the other day and they told me to call someone else
3054,Sounds like you just might be talking to bad people.  Are you fairly young?
3054,i wish. im 40 and ive never had a real friend because everyone is a jerk and selfish
3054,What about the people you game with?  In my experience gamers can be the least jerk-ish or selfish people out there.  It's a kind community
3054,theyre okay but digital relationships arent real. thats why i quit social media.
3054,"i quit social media a few years ago, best decision i ever made.  what makes you say everyone is a jerk or selfish?"
3055,That is fair. Veganism is a dietary choice not a religion. But commercial farming and animal abuses are issues that needs to be addressed.
3055,I can understand that viewpoint. It's a very complicated issue though!
3055,It really is. I think a lot of vegans really go overboard about that stuff. They want the whole world to change in an instant.
3055,I agree. More people should get involved to make a change.
3055,"Change needs to come incrementally. Address small things one at a time, and you can get people to listen. No one wants to change their whole life overnight."
3055,"I agree, I understand that not everyone has the same beliefs"
3055,Of course. Diversity is the spice of life. But I think there are some pretty common things most people will agree on.
3055,i think fruits and veggies are important but our needed nutrition is probably different
3055,"Vegan food has come a long way, but there are some things that are very difficult to replace."
3055,"I can understand that, not everyone can go ""cold turkey"""
3055,"Choosing to eat vegan is just that. A choice. There are no rules to join some magic ""vegan"" club or anything."
3056,That's crazy! Are you a big fan of painting?
3056,i enjoy what i do . acrylic is my favorite medium . what is your passion ?
3056,I'm a big dancer. Professionally and just for fun
3056,that's great . how long have you been dancing ?
3056,All my life! It's just a natural thing for me
3056,its great that you dance . its very enjoyable
3056,It's almost like meditation of sorts. I'm sure painting can be the same way
3056,yes it can ! do you have other hobbies ?
3056,"I enjoy going to the gym as well, but dance is kind of my focus"
3056,Is there any sports that you do regularly?
3056,"Not regularly, but i do like to watch hockey!"
3056,I love to watch baseball!
3057,She is my favorite cousin. I'm her main babysitter.
3057,Cool I'm sure she is lol! Do you know anybody that has adopted a child?
3057,"Oh yes, one of my best friends growing up was adopted. I didn't know until we were 16."
3057,OH wow. That's awesome. I want to adopt too. Maybe foster.
3057,We need more of both in this world. It would be a noble thing.
3057,For sure. What things are you interested in?
3057,I like cars and the color green. I am a simple man. A hunter green '69 Corvette especially.
3057,i see . i do like cars . i want a corvette as well !
3057,They are quite iconic. 
3057,They sure are!!!
3057,"I would like to make a project out of one, and pass it down to my child if given the opportunity."
3057,It would be great for him especially the lighter aluminum models.
3058,"Yeah, and she used to mock my big face cheeks."
3058,"i do need some , my face cheeks are big and make me feel embarrassed"
3058,"I'm sorry, what do you need? I've read a lot online about genetics, I wondered how I got these fat cheeks."
3058,Does genetics play a part in that?
3058,"I'm not sure, but Dimples—indentations on the cheeks—tend to occur in families, and this trait is assumed to be inherited. "
3058,Ah I see. That would be a good guess then.
3058,Do you like to read? I like to read.
3058,I do like reading. Lately I've been reading about Hanukkah music.
3058,What have you read about it?
3058,All about the history of Hanukkah music
3058,Was there anything in particular you found interesting? It is only once a year.
3058,Nothing in particular
3059,At a karaoke bar! If the crowd isn't singing I have to get up there myself! 
3059,"I would be timid, unless drinks were involved. "
3059,"Yep, a few beers really turns people into ""great"" singers lol"
3059,"Or bad ones. In my air force days, we used to watch people embarrass themselves often."
3059,Some of my customers are just terrible but it's fun to watch and we laugh together.
3059,Do you work in a bar or nightclub?
3059,It's a bar. We have karaoke every night though.
3059,Sounds fun. I bet you have stories for days
3059,"Yep, but it's just to get my through school. I am studying to be a nurse."
3059,"Oh cool. I used to be an EMT. Underpaid, over worked."
3059,That is so true! EMTs don't get paid nearly enough for what they do.
3059,"Yes, work is hard and stressful for such low pay."
3060,"It's raining here too.  I guess that's not too bad, because it forces me to stay inside and study."
3060,what are you studying?
3060,"I'm taking philosophy and history at my local community college.  I'm not sure yet what I want to do, but they are both interesting classes. "
3060,I suppose so. I don't remember specifics well enough to take history. Philosophy would be fun. 
3060,It's really interesting.  It gives you a new perspective on thinking.  
3060,I think more people need a change in perspective. 
3060,"Yes, they do.  People preach tolerance these days, but some of the ones who are the most outspoken are the least tolerant of differences."
3060,Do you think tolerance should always equal acceptance?
3060,"I think it depends on the situation and the person't point of view.  A person can tolerate something they don't agree with, but that doesn't necessarily equate to acceptance."
3060,I completely agree. I think that's a balanced view. Good for you.
3060,"Thank you.  You, as well!"
3060,Have you rescued any other animals? Or just the bunny?
3061,I'm a teacher also.
3061,my cousin and my aunt are both teachers and they love it
3061,"I'm the only teacher in my family most others, like my husband, are cops."
3061,My wife is also a teacher...so i guess a nice profession for out family.  I have a lot of respect for cops
3061,I really think teaching is more my speed. It can be worrisome being married to a cop.
3061,I guess so but it sure is a tough job to do.They have so many responsibilities
3061,When my husband gets like that I always remind him that we all have responsibilities.
3061,HAHA...way to put him in his place! lol
3061,I love him but a lot of cops have a little bit of a martyr complex.
3061,"It's true, but they are sworn to an oath and they should be held accountable to that oath."
3061,"Anyway, how did you become interested in art?"
3061,Just alwasy been intersted in it. Started in high school and kept on going in college.
3062,sometimes. especially if the beach is near a volcano.
3062,Really like volcanoes? What about them is so attractive to you
3062,I love to take hikes up volcanoes. Very exciting.
3062,"I love hiking too! Never thought of doing it near a volcano, isnt that dangerous?"
3062,"Yes, but you only live once, right?"
3062,"Yea i suppose so, although it would be cool to be reincarnated at some point"
3062,That would be cool. Especially if you could remember your past life.
3062,Exactly! I think i would want to be something that could fly. What about you?
3062,Yes! I'd love to be able to fly wherever I wanted to go!
3062,Itd be awesome for a beach vacation! 
3062,"Yep, or to Canada, where the women are beautiful"
3062,Yea if you're ok with the cold!
3062,I think I would be
3063,Do you ever draw noses?
3063,i dont draw faces too much. im not good at it. i focus on landscapes
3063,Oh I see. What Kind of landscapes?
3063,"oceans, cities buildings or even fantasy stuff"
3063,Like castles battles?
3063,yeah though i havent drawn a castle in a long time
3063,That's neat. So do you draw in black and white or do you use colored pencils?
3063,i draw on my tablet so i use everything
3063,Do you draw graphics and numbers? Or do you just stick with landscapes?
3063,i do a bit of everything but i like nature
3063,I like the number 7. You should draw that some time!
3063,do you think its lucky?
3064,Yeah she went through some tough times
3064,Oh yes I bet. She is much better now than when she went by Ke$ha
3064,I hope she goes on tour soon
3064,I hopefully can see her on her next tour.
3064,Do you think she will play some of her music she did when she was Ke$ha?
3064,"I'm not sure, probably. I know her single I Did It Again broke international sales records though."
3064,I really hope she does because it brings back great memories for me.
3064,Do you like any other musicians?
3064,I also really like Sia
3064,She puts out some pretty crazy music videos
3064,You are correct! What musicians do you like?
3064,I like Tegan & Sara. Have you heard much from them?
3064,"I have heard of them, They are fun!"
3065,2020 Lexus RX truck. It is the nicest truck I've ever seen
3065,It looks nice! What car do you have now
3065,"I have a Hyundai. When I make more money I can get a much better car, haha! "
3065,that's a good way to think! As long as your car gets you there then it's perfectly fine for now!\
3065,"YOU: You're right about that. But, as my career I run in marathon races. Maybe I can run everywhere I need to go and save for the car, lol!"
3065,That's one way to train for marathons! I actually do a lot of night running
3065,Awesome! Running is good for the body. Do you listen to music while you run?
3065,absolutely. Kind of puts me in a trance
3065,Same here. I like to listen to the All American Rejects. Who are your favorites?
3065,I tend to listen to old emo music like The Used
3065,"I have never heard of them. I usually don't listen to Emo, though. "
3065,they are pretty cool. You may like them if you like All american rejects
3066,Oh really? I'm not really familiar with Saudi cuisine. What is it like?
3066,It is really good. But of course I am not a good cook.
3066,"Fortunately, there are a lot of resources and instructional videos though that can help. And practice is the best."
3066,Yes practicing is good but takes a lot of time and dedication. 
3066,"Very true. And you have to have a desire to learn that stuff, just like anything. Otherwise it doesn't stick."
3066,I guess that is true.
3066,That's why a lot of classes throughout school can be boring. Because it is more difficult to learn things just for the sake of learning them.
3066,that is true. Do you go to school?
3066,"Not for a long time, but I would like to go back and major in something different that I actually like and would use. Do you?"
3066,No. But I was thinking about going to a night class for cooking.
3066,Those can be a lot of fun! And you will always get a chance to eat what you make!
3066,"Yes that is true, and I could learn all kinds of cuisines."
3067,"I'm from Texas, but I've never heard of queens of the stone age.  What type of music do they play?"
3067,"OMG?! What? Go to Spotify and listen to Go with the Flow, I think it's amazing. "
3067,I'll have to check that out this evening after I give my horses their afternoon run.
3067,How many horses?
3067,"I just have two right now, but I plan to get more in the future.  I love to ride horses!"
3067,Aren't the expensive to own?
3067,"They can be, but they're worth it.  They're my babies."
3067,Those are some big babies. Ha ha. I'd have to give up my Big Mac addiction to afford them. 
3067,Ha!  I haven't had a Big Mac in years.
3067,"No Big Mac's, No Queens of the Stone Age, what do you do in Texas besides horses?"
3067,"That's pretty much my life.  I do listen to music though.  Mostly classic rock...Queen, the Eagles, Elton John...stuff like that."
3067,All great stuff. Good taste
3068,Which ones?
3068,breaking ben and 5 finger
3068,Nice! I like them too
3068,"if you like hockey and movies, have you ever seen "
3068,Seen what?
3068,Slap shot the movie with Paul Newman?
3068,Not in a long time
3068,Gotcha. I love watching television but don't get much time too anymore. lol All my time is spent in the gym or turking.
3068,Ah yes work certainly gets in the way of relaxing
3068,Defiantly. I do an hour of body building daily. And an hour of powerlifting every day. So it's a sure time killer for me. lol
3068,Wow you must be in great shape!
3068,"Trying to get there. Problem is, I can't walk today! LOL  I had squat day yesterday and my legs are on FIRE lol"
3069,What kind of car does your mother drive?
3069,"it is a older model , but really fast !"
3069,I see. What kind of car do you drive?
3069,I have a toyota highlander. What do you drive?
3069,Honda Civic. What kind of car is your favorite?
3069,"I like SUVs, lots of room"
3069,True. My family just got a van for that reason
3069,"Yes, minivans have a lot of room. I don't know if I can see myself in one though."
3069,Gotta do what you gotta do when you have kiddos. It's been better than I anticipated
3069,How old are your kiddos now?
3069,I have a five year old but I also foster so the number varies. You have any?
3069,I have two- one married and one still at home
3070,"Yes, nothing im proud of but such is life"
3070,I know what you mean. It is always a reason to be proud.
3070,"Right, looking forward to my career in party planning."
3070,That sounds interesting
3070,"Do you have a party coming up soon? Wedding, etc?"
3071,He's the CEO for an engineering firm. I'm going to school for Electrical Engineering.
3071,"Wow, engineering, sounds impressive.  I'm sure the income will be awesome."
3071,That's what I'm hoping for. We've had a good life growing up.
3071,A solid and happy family life is the key to a happy life!
3071,That is true. Do you like music?
3071,"yes , i love music ! what about you ? any favorites ?"
3071,I'm big into metal. I would have to say my favorite is Iron Maiden. What about you?
3071,Iron Maiden is great to jam to. My favorite album of their's is The Number of the Beast.
3071,I like that album too. My dad took me to see them when I was a kid and I fell in love.
3071,"Oh man, your dad sounds awesome."
3071,He is. I'm very grateful for him. 
3071,That's so great. Great parents are treasures!
3071,"Yes they are, it's the greatest treasure."
3072,I didn't study and prepare as much as I should have.
3072,Oh no! Too much time playing videos games?
3072,Ha. No. I'm not a gamer. Just kept putting it off.
3072,Oh haha. My brothers are huge gamers and thats why they failed a lot of exams. Thats why I asked.
3072,"Yes, I can see how it could be a major distraction. I've just never been interested. "
3072,What do you like to do for fun then? I like to draw and look at memes.
3072,I love to read! 
3072,Oh me too! I'm a big Jim Butcher fan. What about you?
3072,I really like John Grisham.
3072,I haven't heard of him before. What kind of books does he write?
3072,Legal thrillers. His books are definitely page-turners.
3072,i will have to check those out . thanks for letting me know
3073,I was in complete shock....looked around and noticd that a fall branch fell on it
3073,ha of all things. any idea how it happened? 
3073,"It was pretty windy this morning when i was going for my walk, so maybe the wind made it"
3073,That makes sense. As long as you're alright! And here I thought exercise was good for you.
3073,"It defintely woke me up, so i guess that was a positive. Do you exercise at all in the morning"
3073,I am off on Fridays in the summer so I exercise in the morning then
3073,"I work from home on fridays, so that extra time in the morning, defintely helps"
3073,Nice! An early start for the weekend for you then. Beats commuting. 
3073,More or less! What do you do
3073,I am in sales. Get a lot of walking done that way haha
3073,For sure..do you have to travel a lot too?
3073,Mostly just around the city. How about yourself?
3074,That is really interesting. Where did you learn that?
3074,I don't remember. I tend to pick up useless trivia everywhere I go....What do you do for a living?
3074,I am a stay at home mom of two lovely boys. how about you?
3074,I'm a property manager. I was a stay at home mom for a long time.
3074,How do you like property management?
3074,Its awful! Nobody likes coming to our office. They'd rather visit the IRS. 
3074,ah good point! at least it keeps you busy!
3075,I can try.
3075,"Oh wow, I'm sure she will understand! My send some nice flowers and a sorry card."
3075,"I feel like understanding won't enter this equation. Maybe, I can ask my boss if I can work late for the next year."
3075,You might want to try therapy because the habit of being late or delayed in arriving can be bad for your health.
3075,I hadn't heard that. Was there a study?
3075,"Well, it may be worth investigating."
3075,I don't know most of that stuff goes right over my head. 
3075,"I understand, but, just keep trying and don't give up."
3075,It's times like this I wish I still worked in my family's restaurant. When I felt bad there I would just steal a pie and eat behind the restaurant.
3075,What kind of pie do you like?
3075,I like apple but shouldn't eat too much pie because I work behind a desk all day.
3075,"Yes and the calories can add up, fast."
3076,"I never knew that, I have a parrot also. How do you know so much about them?"
3076,I guess I've read a lot about them. What kind of colors does your parrot have?
3076,"The typical colours, green mainly though. Do you do a lot of reading?"
3076,I do enjoy reading. Mostly fantasy and sci fi. Who is your favorite author?
3076,"I like a few, but mainly Douglas Adams. "
3076,"Ah, yeah. Cute. Octavia Butler is my favorite"
3076,"I've not heard of them, what are some of their books? I will check them out."
3076,"A series called Xenogenesis, starting with the book ""Dawn."" Weird but pretty good social commentary"
3076,"Sounds interesting. I'm trying to get my kids to read more too, would you recommend them for children?"
3076,Probably not. I'm actually a teacher.. how old are your kids?
3076,"They're 8 and 13. A teacher, that's interesting. Do you enjoy it?"
3076,i love it . there's always something interesting happening . what do you do ?

3078,Nice! Maybe I should try making them sometime
3078,It's much easier than people think. My brother taught me. 
3078,Oh good. I've always been weary of poaching eggs
3078,"Add a little vinegar before you drop them, helps them hold together. "
3078,thank you for the tip ! what else do you do ?

3080,That would be nice. I take a vacation every summer along Lake Michigan. Nice place for a cabin. 
3080,"Oh, that sounds like a great place for a cabin! How long have you been vacationing at Lake Michigan?"
3080,For years now I travel with my Jazz band there. I playing the saxophone. Do you play any instruments or like Jazz?
3081,That must be really tricky! Does he enjoy what he does?
3081,"He does, but it can be very stressful at times. "
3081,I get it! I know about stress. I wish life was easier sometimes
3081,"Yes, everyone has some level of stress, although I am lucky that my life is pretty low-stress!"
3081,What kind of hobbies do you enjoy?
3081,I really enjoy reading. How about you?
3081,I love reading. My favorite kinds of books are from agatha christie. What about you?
3081,I really like John Grisham's legal thrillers. They're page-turners!
3081,ooo that does sound really cool! I like thrillers. Do you have any kids?
3081,Yes - I have one adult daughter. And three little grandsons!
3081,Wow! How nice! I have 5 children total but two of them have since passed away sadly

3082,yeah Just moved to Saint John Canada
3082,Nice! do you like it there?
3082,Yeah Its quite small and beautiful city. Not to much crowded and community is very good....
3082,"I love smaller cities, and great that it's not over crowded either! Are you involved in any of the community events?"
3082,Not till now because I just moved from India one month before. So I didnt got any opportunity to participate in any community events.
3082,"My parents are always talking about travelling to India, they have been married for 39 years and want to visit India next year for their 40th wedding anniversary!"
3082,That's a good decision.. They will have good time in India.. There are lots of good places to visit.Ask them to visit Simla first. Its a beautiful city of India.
3082,"Thank you for the tip! I'll let them know, what is there to do in Simla?"
3083,I am Play in the NBA for the Detroit Pistons!
3083,"That's great, are you ready for the new season"
3083,Oh yeah! I've been training hard and I'm super excied!
3083,How many hours a day are you training
3084,"lol, so true! I wish I would have understood how credit works when I was younger."
3084,Tell me about it! haha im still paying them off. Working in the bank helps me know more now though.
3084,I would imagine so. You must see all types of customers who encounter the same problem.
3084,Ive had my fair share. not so long ago that was me when i had been going through graduation
3084,"You know, I love reading and I have found some great books about financial strategy and managing money that have helped me tremendously.  "
3084,I think Dave Ramsey has a good program for beginners in financial literacy
3084,"Definitely, his radio show is quite informative and he has some great tips! "
3084,thanks ! i will have to check it out ! when is it on?
3084,"I believe he live streams on YouTube, Monday-Friday between 2PM-5PM ET. Have you hever seen the movie Goodfellas? It's a classic and one of my favorites. "
3084,I've never seen the movie Goodfellas.  What kind of movie is it?

3084,I will have to check it out. #i like mafia movies
3085,Good advice. I just miss my mom and dad
3085,"I'm sorry to hear that, did they pass away?"
3085,Yes they did. In an accident. Are you close to your parents?
3085," I'm so sorry! Kind of, I am the middle child of three siblings, and live far away from my family. Do you have siblings?"
3085,"No, I am an only child. What do you do for a living? I am following in my mom's footsteps as an RN."
3085,"Oh, that's so nice! My fiance and I want to travel and teach English abroad, I just graduated from University. Are you still in school?"
3085,"That sounds like that would be an amazing experience! No, I just graduated and landed my first job at a hospital near me."
3085,"Awesome, congratulations! I bet your parents would be really proud!"
3085,I hope so! My dad owned a drywall company and my mom worked hard as a nurse. If I can live up to their hard work I'd be happy
3085,I'm sure you'll be a great nurse! What country is your family from?
3085,Originally we are from Ireland but my great-grandfather came to the USA when he was a boy.. what about you?
3085,"Really, my grandmother was actually born in Ireland! She met my grandfather in England, and they moved to Canada"
3086,"I've never really had much talent for art. These days, I don't have the time. I drive 300 miles a week for work."
3086,"I have done that for years as well. Depending on what you have going on in your life you can always make a little time, though."
3086,True.  I do like to go running when I have a chance.  I'd like to run a marathon someday. 
3086,Marathons are insane! did you hear about the guy that ran one in under two hours?
3086,Yes!  That's so impressive!
3086,"I couldn't imagine running 26 miles in a day, much less in two hours. Its amazing what people can push themselves to do."
3086,"Yes, it is.  Do you do any running?"
3086,"NO, I actually hate running, but thats why I respect people that do it. I do ride a bike though, for pretty long distances."
3086,"That's impressive as well.  I used to do some biking, but I've gotten away from it. "
3086,"I used to go mountain biking as well, but I haven't done it in some time. I miss that, it was exhilarating."
3086,I'll bet!  Where was your favorite place for mountain biking?
3086, I did get to go in Vermont once. It was absolutely beautiful. The Green Mountains.
3087,I think she is being catfished by someone overseas and has been sending him money that she needs for her own bills.
3087,Oh no! That's awful. I watch a lot of shows about catfishing and overseas romance so I'm really wary.
3087,"I watch 90 Day Fiance which is what has me so suspicious of this guy.  ""He"" has never actually spoken to or video chatted with her"
3087,"Oh yeah, that's a big red flag. I love that show but it makes me sad sometimes!"
3087,"It makes me sad too, i feel like there is a lot of manipulation in almost every one of those relationships.  Even from the producers i think"
3087,I agree. That's true of all reality television. I like to get the cast members' perspectives after filming is over.
3087,The unfortunate case is a lot of that manipulation is in the form of Non-Disclosure Agreements and such... I just hope my friend doesnt go on the show
3087,Oh my gosh she isn't thinking about it she??
3087,"No way, but they advertise all over the place and shes active on social media so who knows.  I was approached for Judge Judy once (legitimately)"
3087,I had a friend who recruited for that show. I've never been approached for or applied for any reality tv but I do love to watch it.
3087,"I was approached because of a small claims lawsuit i filed.  They scrape public records for ""juicy"" cases and approach people on social media"
3087,"Yep, that's exactly what they do! It wasn't Judge Judy she worked for it was Judge Joe Brown. That's what they all do. Looking for personal drama."
3088,No I am not. What is that? 
3088,It's a national organization that helps to protect animals. Check it out!
3088,"I will do that, thanks for the tip!"
3088,"You're welcome. You will find it very interesting, I think. "
3088,"I think will, it is important to protect animals"
3088,Definitely. They're important to our ecosystem and way of life.
3088,Have you joined the National Animal Interest Alliance also?
3088,"Yes, I've been a member for several years now."
3088,"That is very impressive, do they have volunteer work available? "
3088,"Yes, they sure do. It's easy to get involved."
3088,That's great news!
3088,Yes! I'm sure you could find a volunteer opportunity with them that you would enjoy.
3089,people can be cruel torturing animals
3089,"I agree, people who do animal cruelty should be in jail. I have a pit bull and he is big baby...."
3089,you just have to know how to treat them.
3090,"That is obscure, how do you know that? "
3090,"I'm a huge comic fan, and that is a pretty major factoid!"
3090,I love comics but I guess not as much as you! What are your favourites?
3090,I would have to say Deadpool. It's funny and action packed!
3090,So Marvel > DC for you I assume? 
3090,Absolutely! How about you?
3090,Marvel for sure. Xmen has always been my favourite series.
3090,I love X-men. I used to play the x-men video game on SNES as a kid all the time!
3090,Mutant apocalypse?? That was such a good game!
3090,It was amazing! I always played gambit
3090,Wolverine for me. Fellow Canadian haha
3090,Makes sense! Can't go wrong with him
3091,"No pets, children are enough to look after. They are hilarious, I should be writing down the crazy things they do. "
3091,you are right- children do some crazy things
3091,Like ask for a peanut butter and egg sandwich...lol
3091,i think i know a few college boy who would do that!
3091,Some of us never grow up. 
3091,"yes, i see a lot of that here on campus"
3091,What are you studieing?
3091,I am studying engineering
3091,What made you choose that?
3091,My dad is an engineer and I have alwasy thought it was interesting. What do you do?
3091,"A few different jobs, whatever I can find really. Just hope to make enough to pay the bills. "
3091,I understand that. Hopefully I can find a job after I graduate.
3092,That is crazy.  I am a rapper and I could not imagine being in front of that many people.
3092,it was packed with a lot of people !
3092,How close to the stage were you?
3092,"No, unfortunately not. It was a lot of fun however so was just happy to take part and be amongst the atmosphere."
3092,I bet.  You read about all the drug use at Woodstock  Was that really the case?
3093,"Yeah, my drums and biking are passions of mine."
3093,"I played the alto sax in school, but dropped it."
3093,That's too bad. I always hate seeing people drop the things that make them happy.
3093,"Oh well, there were many other things of interest for me."
3093,That's cool I guess we all have to let some things go in life. The hardest for me was chocolate cake.
3093,"I understand because I liked chocolate cake , too."
3093,Yeah it was hard for me because I learned I was diabetic as an adult and it messes with my blood sugar.
3093,"I don't eat sweets, either, for weight management as well as blood sugar control."
3093,With my biking I never had too much of a problem with weight but I do have to be careful with my blood sugar.
3093,That's good and the exercise with biking is great.
3093,I tried running but it always felt a little monotonous. 
3093,"Yeah and it isn't good for the knees, either."
3093,I have a couple siblings about the same age as me who run marathons and they are already having problems with their knees.
3094,"Because I didn't know how it would affect me, so I wasn't sure what to expect."
3094,"I totally understand. The first time I drank, I wondered the same thing. Was it okay?"
3094,Totally fine. Seems I was worried for nothing
3094,That's good. Glad it worked out. Have you been drinking since then?
3094,"Sure. Mostly beer, IPA and lager. What are your favorites?"
3094,"Generally, I like the harder kinds of liquor. Vodka and rum are pretty good to me"
3094,Vodka and rum are too strong for me and I usually am quickly in over my head.
3094,I get that. Took me a while to get used to them. I personally like them because you can mix them with non-alcoholic drinks
3094,"Yes, I do enjoy a screwdriver every now and again. How's your morning been going so far?"
3094,Been okay. Getting to the bank for work was a little tough.
3094,"Hey, I used to be a teller. What side of the bank do you work on?"
3094,Accounting side
3095,Have you been playing for awhile?
3095,"Yes, I play guitar as a hobby. I began playing violin in high school and I just never stopped."
3095,Do you feel you're better as a guitar player or violing player
3095,"Definitely violin! How about you, what do you do for work?"
3095,"I'm a government contractor.  Not very exciting, but pays the bills! How about you"
3095,"That's a great paying job, I bet it keeps you active. I do micro jobs online as a source of income."
3095,I just started doing some micro jobs...i really like them I do for some extra income
3095,"i do the same, particularly transcribing and data entry. I actually enjoy it."
3095,"I'm a fan of the surveys..allows me to get through a lot of them. I'm always look for the batch work, but thye are hard to find."
3095,"I know how that is. Good luck with your search, hope you find some good opportunities :)"
3095,don't you find the transcribing hard?
3095,it can be tedious but i enjoy it. and most of the time I get to learn about new and interesting topics so that part is cool
3096,No I am not. She really likes deep fried foods and hostess products.
3096,"Oh, I see. There are many benefits to eating raw vegetables, even onions. You should try to add a few of those in."
3096,Yeah I should. I could also cook the meat differently too.
3096,Cutting out red meat is a good place to start!
3096,That's a good idea! It's too expensive anyway. I can easily switch in chicken or fish.
3096,Chicken and fish are good lean meats. Turkey also!
3096,I love turkey! I need to figure out how to keep it moist though.
3096,"Yes, turkey drying out can sometimes be a problem, but it could get water from adding vegetables"
3096,Like onions? What about carrots?
3096,"Carrots are great for moisture and for taste. I don't like to cook onions though, I prefer them raw."
3096,That's interesting! Do you eat them like an apple? 
3096,"Yes, I just take huge bites out of the whole bulb after I peel and wash it. "
3097,"You would think the drink is spicy, but it's not"
3097,I can see where it could be spicy. I drink dr. pepper alot. although its not spicy yoiu can notice a slight kick
3097,"yea, I like sprite too. Don't drink it a lot though"
3097,I love DR. Pepper. It's just so hard for me to keep the weight down if I continue to drink it.
3097,"yea, try to stay away from the sugary drinks. They are not good for the waistline"
3097,Oh yea. I used to play football in school. I should get back into sports
3097,"I try to stay active by exercising, but it's very hard"
3097,I agree! I give into my indulgences too often! haha
3097,You are not alone. It's funny how it's easy to indulge and so so difficult to burn it off. 
3097,Yeah no kidding! Do you have any strange cravings?
3097,"yea, mine is carbs especially bread. I try to stay away, but so difficult"
3097,Do you have a hard time eliminating carbs?
3097,"Are you kidding, it's tough but will keep trying."
3098,I dont like any particular music style but still I can listen to any song quite smoothly
3098,What kind of music do you prefer? I play the guitar. I actually use to travel the world playing. 
3098,I just listen a few songs by kodaline and other musician...
3098,Nice choices. I listen to Kodaline at work. Not too long ago I started working online. 
3098,"Good. do you heard the song name ""Follow Your Fire"" its a best song from kodaline..."
3098,I have heard of that. Great song!
3098,ohh yeah Great..... So who is your favorite singer???
3098,"My favorite SINGER is BEYONCE. But, I also love Maroon 5. Yours?"
3098,Selena Gomez but I also like to listen Justin Beiber... 
3098,Oh I like Selena and Justin as well. I kind of miss them as a couple. Selena has been through a lot and so has Justin. They should retry. 
3098,Yeah I think in the same way but I dont think they both think in that way!!!!
3098,"Lol, this is true! But, we never know with these celebrities, honestly. I know Justin's married but there's been rumors. "
3098,yeah we cant say anything about them...
3099,"A baby. :) Kidding, not sure yet. "
3099,still early i guess.  will you be doing a gender reveal
3099,I hope so! We're still looking at creative ideas. 
3099,look on pintrest and you.  that is where we got inspo for our gender reveal
3099,Great idea! Was yours a boy or a girl?
3099,twin girls.  they are about to be one next month
3099,Wow! I have twin sisters. They're identical. 
3099,mine too.  we couldn't tell them apart when they were little so we had to get them name braclets
3099,Awww. I was the only one who could tell my sisters apart. I was two when they were born. 
3099,wow ... u must have been a smart little kid
3099,I probably just didn't know that they looked alike at that early age. They've always looked different to me.
3099,i don't like science at all but when i found out i was having twins ... i started reading about genes and how twins are created 
3100,"He graduated some time ago, so I don't think so"
3100,"You said he is quite busy, do you both get time to spend with each other?"
3100,"Some times, the kids take up most of my time"
3100,I can imagine it is very satisfying to get to spend the day with your own children! Definitely needs its breaks though.
3100,"Yes, do you have any children?"
3100,"Yes, I have one who just turned 5! How old are your children?"
3100,They are 8 and 6. Do you work?
3100,I am a kindergarten teacher. How about you?
3100,"I am a stay at home mom, I just wrangle kids all day but not as many as you do."
3100,"Oh lol! It's ok, you are a mom and it's the hardest job EVER and very thankless. You are doing good"
3100,"Thanks, Do you teach at a public school or private?"
3100,Public school! It has it's challenges but it's very rewarding.
3101,"i think so, if it is just the radiator it self it wont be expensive "
3101,"My mom could probably fix that for you, she is a mechanic and really talented."
3101,wow that would be awesome. how much do you think she would charge?
3101,She would probably give you the friends and family discount
3102,"Hey, Christmas is my favorite too! Do you get to celebrate with family?"
3102,I wish I was able to but I currently live a bit far from my family.
3102,Oh? Where do you live currently?
3102,Louisiana and most of my family is back home in Jamaica or Florida. How about you?
3102,"Virginia, but most of my family is in California. You're quite the distance from yours! Do you get to visit often?"
3102,"I ahvent been to Jamaica in 5 years. I am beyond homesick, but with 3 kds it's quite expensive to travel"
3102,"Oh, man. I know that feeling.. so often I need a vacation after taking a vacation with kids"
3102,Lol. I so can relate. Kds are exhausting but rewarding :). Do you have any kids?
3102,"I have a five year but I also foster, so the amount of kids changes up. It's been a wild ride."
3102,I love the idea of dostering
3102,"Haha yeah, it's hard in practice. But it's all pretty worth it"
3102,You must have a big heart.
3103,gimme a turn on that gittern!
3103,Yes what a funny name! I would love to learn more about the history.
3103,"I don't like history, my teacher is mean. "
3103,Oh that's too bad. It's really hard to learn a subject when you don't have a good teacher. A good teacher makes learning so much more fun!
3103,I wish I could pick my teachers. 
3103,"Sometimes you can, at least in college."
3103,But that is so far away. 
3103,Oh yea? What grade are you studying right now? Do you play any sports in school? I was a good runner in school!
3103,"I don't like sports, I'm no good. I do like to draw tho. "
3103,"Oh drawing is a good hobby too! But I like to be more active, that's why I run. I like the exercise."
3103,I don't like exercise. Or being outside. It's always cold and full of bugs. 
3103,Well that's ok. There are lots of fun things to do inside. Maybe I can give you guitar lessons sometime!
3104,They are poorly behaved
3104,How old are your children?
3104,One is 12 and the other is 9
3104,"It takes a lot of patience, doesn't it."
3104,"Yes it is hard, especially after a long shift at Mcdonalds where I work."
3104,I know it's bad but my guilty pleasure is McDonalds
3104,"Yes, it is so delicious and also cheap."
3104,"Yes, and sausage McMuffins are my favorite."
3104,My favourite is Chicken Legend.
3104,"Most of the time I eat more healthy foods, though."
3104,So do I as I sit around playing video games too often.
3104,Do you like to play Mario Kart?
3105,I would rather listen to the radio
3105,You should give choirs a chance. Listening to music in person is a totally different experience.
3105,"Maybe, I think I would miss the band"
3105,"Well, there's no band, but there is an organ."
3105,"I don't know where I would listen to a choir, a church?"
3105,"Yes, there should be one at almost any large church. They're always glad to have new people, so don't be afraid to just show up."
3105,"ok, maybe i can give it a try"
3105,Great! I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Let me know what you think.
3105,Do you go to church?
3105,Yes. Both of my parents are in the choir. They'd be disappointed if I didn't show up.
3105,i guess i understand your love for choir now
3105,"Yes. They wanted me to join as well, but I can't sing at all."
3106,I made sure to take a lot of pictures of the ceremony.
3106,how much did medical school cost?
3106,I'll tell you when I find my arm and my leg.
3106,what medical field is your daughter going into?
3106,Podiatry if you can believe that.
3106,i could never be a doctor. i like helping people but hate hospitals
3106,I could never do it either that's why I became an environmental engineer.
3106,what does an environmental engineer do?
3106,My job mostly involves studying pollution.
3106,oh yeah? im retired so i just drink beers by my creek all day
3106,Just don't mix the two up and drink creek water by mistake.
3106,yeah a cousin drank from it once and got very sick
3106,I work in a large watershed and you wouldn't believe the things I find in the water.
3107,That's exactly what my best friend has been saying!
3107,The Celtics have so much history in the NBA. They were one of the eight original teams in the league!
3107,Haha I know right?! What else are you into in your free time?
3107,Be outside and hanging out with friends
3107,Do you like card games?
3107,Yes! What kind do you like?
3107,My fave is magic the gathering! How bout you??
3107,I like Munchkin
3107,Ugh I'm really not into Munchkin I find it boring!
3107,Need the right group. It gets pretty intense with my friends
3108,It's crazy how long it has been around. I can't wait to have a cookout with my new family
3108,"New family? And are you doing the cooking? I have some tips, I did it professionally for a long time."
3108,"I am actually pregnant for the first time! With a little boy. My husband will actually be doing the grilling, but we'd love to hear your tips!"
3108,"Congratulations! That's wonderful. Well, your best best is to buy fresh meat, never use those pre-made frozen burgers."
3108,"I agree! Fresh meat is the best. After my dad would finish preaching when I was a kid, we'd always go by the local butcher shoppe"
3108,"Oh wow, that's really cool! I miss local butchers. They always had interesting or different things. Grocery stores are just not the same."
3108,"No, they're not. The quality of the meats are horrible compared to butchers"
3108,Did you know they add dyes to their meat a lot of the time? Just to make it look fresher and more appealing. I hate that.
3108,"Oh wow. No, I didn't know that. That is disgusting. What is your favorite type of meat to grill?"
3108,"Inch-thick ribeye steaks,I think are the best. They are fatty enough to absorb the char flavor, and they are the perfect mix of tender and meaty."
3108,"That is my favorite, too! My mouth is watering thinking about a good ribeye!"
3108,"I love a ribeye with a salad, grilled zucchini or summer squash, mashed potatoes, and a ribeye. A perfect meal."
3109,Whoa! Purple hair? That is sooo cool! 
3109,Yes - I like to show my unique personality. Hair is an easy way to do it without it being permanent. 
3109,"This is true. I would love to dye my hair purple, but, I am not sure how my parents would handle it. "
3109,You could always use one that would wash out if they don't like it.
3109,"Oh, that sounds like an idea. Are they easy to find in the store and is it easy to do?"
3109,"Yes, super easy. Any beauty supply store should have it."
3109,Thanks! I will check it out. So do you have any hobbies?
3109,Yes - I love to read. How about you?
3109,Cooking. I love making Italian Food
3109,Yummy! We go to Italy every May!
3109,Oh nice! I am trying to save up some money to go there one day myself. 
3109,"We love it. We spend a week at the Amalfi Coast, then a week somewhere else. Blessed!"
3110,School is very important and a good thing to be focused on! Do you know what you want to do after school is finished?
3110,"I plan on going to school for a long time. I want a PhD, just like my mother has. "
3110,A PhD in what?
3110,"I'm not sure yet. Poli Sci or History, maybe. Did you go to college?"
3110,"No, but I did go to beauty school."
3110,That's pretty cool. Do you do hair or makeup?
3110,Hair! I got so tired of paying so much money to keep my own hair blonde that I decided to learn how to do it myself!
3110,That's pretty crazy. What kind of hairstyles are your favorite?
3110,Up-do's. There are so many choices to them. Yours?
3110,"I like a messy look, the kind that looks like you don't actually care"
3110,I'm pretty good at that look considering how much I've let myself go lol
3110,hahaha. I usually go for a lazy ponytail most of the time
3111,"I wish they were cosmetic, I am near sighted"
3111,Have you been wearing them for awhile?
3111,"Glasses as a child, contacts as an adult"
3111,I like contacts for the wide field of vision. I also worked outside and would sweat on my glasses lol.
3111,"I don't cook, so I like not having to bring glasses into the restaurant when I go out to eat!"
3111,Yes glasses are much more convenient for some people understandable. Some types of glasses are used to protect against visible or nearly visible light or radiation?
3111,"I mean, I'm no expert on glasses....I wear contacts lol"
3111,Have you ever worn any type of eye safety while playing a sport?
3111,No I don't play sports. You?
3111,All the time. Do you exercise
3111,I live on a 3rd story walk-up. Does that count?
3111,That's a good effective walk!
3112,"He lives far away, but thats okay, he sometimes comes and has picnics with my mother and I."
3112,"I've lived far from my dad as well, you should make a trip to see him"
3112,I think that is a great idea. I love traveling and being outdoors.
3112,"I do too, my family and I love taking trips to the beach when we can get away from the shop"
3112,Do you have picnics at the beach?
3112,"Yes we usually pack lunch and eat there, but the kids mostly like to just swim"
3112,"I also like to swim, and naps on the beach are nice."
3112,"It is always relaxing spending the day at the beach, although my husband burns easily "
3112,I do as well! I always pack sunscreen for my picnics
3112,"I always use sun screen, we like to pack an umbrella for extended outdoor activities "
3112,"That is very smart, the sun can be dangerous."
3112,"Yes, especially so on cloudy or fall days when you don't expect it to be strong"
3113,I also have braces!
3113,You must be very proud of your new set of teeth
3113,"I am, my family is really happy that I got them fixed."
3113,my mom told me i had to get them to fix my teeth .
3113,We are lucky we could afford them.
3113,Yeah we were barely able to afford mine. I think my dad used a work bonus to cover it.
3113,Yeah its hard to have extra money when we have three dogs to take care of.
3113,I would imagine. I bet you spend a ton of money on food every month
3113,"Oh absolutely, Maddie is our biggest and I swear she eats a bag to herself."
3113,What breed is she? She sounds like a Mastiff or a Saint Bernard
3113,She is a Norwegian Elkhound
3113,I haven't heard of that breed before. I'v only ever owned a Brittney spaniel. 
3114,Unfortunately one of my kids got sick so we had to cancel everything.
3114,"I'm sorry, I feel awful for you. "
3114,Do you have any plans for Labor day?
3114,"I'm looking for something to do, but I have no idea what. "
3114,I always suggest a good lakefront with a boat! I'm sure you'll find something to do.
3114,I love that idea! What are you plans?
3114,Right now it's going to be to nurse Jenny back to health and hope the poor girl doesn't have to miss any school.
3114,I hope so too. I'm sure she appreciates it. I hope you get a vacation soon. 
3114,"Thank you, me too! Teaching and being a parent takes it's toll. Do you have any kids?"
3114,"I don't have any of my own, but I have a bunch of kids that I teach at a daycare. They are like family. "
3114,Oh how wonderful! I have 26 kids in my own class. Which age group do you teach at the daycare?
3114,I teach in the 3's room. They can be rambunctious. 
3115,That is really cool! I am kind of an audiophile so I love learning about sounds.
3115,"Oh awesome, my little sister uses my old pair all the time I finally got a very good pair and the sound quality if wonderful."
3115,"That sounds nice. I prefer headsets because earbuds make my ears hurt, so those sound nice."
3115,"I've gotten a set of turtle beaches, and they are about the best for noise canceling... I've heard about the Bose ones but they are so expensive'"
3115,What colors do the Bose ones come in? My favorite color is red.
3115,I've seen them in blue and black I really like red though.
3115,"I like blue as well, very relaxing color."
3115,"yea can be a very calming color, black goes with anything tough"
3115,"True but sometimes I have a hard time with misplacing black headphones, they blend in."
3115,they can but I find if you put them up like on the side of a mirror or on a dresser it can be easier to find them. 
3115,"Thats a good point, I also struggle with my cat chewing on them."
3115,ugh yea I got a dog that will do the same thing if the cord are not up
3116,You had twins when you were only 17??
3116,Yes just turned 5 in June
3116,"Wow, that's crazy. Weren't you scared to death?"
3116,Very
3116,How did you cope with all of the stress? I feel like I'm going crazy.
3116,I had a lot of support from my family and friends
3116,That makes sense. I am thankful for my family.
3116,yes i was lucky to have my family and my significant other by my side
3116,"Yea, I would say very lucky. Mine hasn't quite come to terms with it yet."
3116,Why is that>
3116,He said he needed some time to process everything after we found out we were having twins.
3117,She is getting baptized this Sunday!
3117,Aw that's amazing! How old is she?
3117,She is 12. And has the same trust in God as me
3117,That's beautiful your daughter will remember that for the rest of her life.
3117,Yes she will. I know I remember mine well.
3117,I don't remember mine but I was baptized very young. How old were you?
3117,I was 10. And it was my friend's father that baptized me.
3117,That's even better when you have someone related to you doing the ceremony.
3117,"I agree. I wish that technology was as good back then as it is now, I would like to see video of it!"
3117,I know right! Just remember to be present instead of hiding behind your phone the whole time!
3117,I don't bring my phone to church.
3117,Oh that's a good idea they can be very distracting.
3118,I would be too. What are your plans?
3118,"my husband and i will be going on a trip for our 5 yr anniversary,  it was last month but we will be taking a trip in 3 months"
3118,I would love to take a vacation too. Without kids!!!!!
3118,we don't have kids yet.  we have some friends that do one vacation with the kids and one without
3118,"By the way, congrats on your anniversary"
3118,thank you! can't believe it as been so long already... still remember our wedding like it was yesterday
3118,My wedding went by like a blur. Barely remember the day. Its almost 10 years for us
3118,wow... marriage goals.  well you should have a big 10 yr celebration ... like a mini wedding
3118,Hmmm. That's a nice idea. Thanks. 
3118,"whats ur secret to a happy marriage with kids.  already hard without kids, can't image the added stress"
3118,I wish  could tell you it isnt hard but it is. Communication is key and time with each other and by yourself too
3118,my husband and i have weekly date nights.  have missed one in the last 5 yrs. do you guys do that?
3118,Dating is hard as we have to get a sitter which is expensive so we do date night once a month
3118,true that
3118,Enjoy the rest of your day
3118,u too
3119,"I know, me too! It doesn't take much to freak me out!"
3119,Me neither! I get asked a lot for rides because I am a truck driver. 
3119,Yeah I bet you see all kind of things in that line of work don't you??!
3119,yes . my work is definitely weird . i just live a weird life . lol .
3119,"haha, has your job ever taken you to the UK?"
3119,No. Can't drive a truck through the ocean. lol
3119,"ugh I want to visit the UK so bad, I was hoping you'd been and had some stories for me!"
3119,I'm sorry. Maybe do some searching online to see if you can find some info?
3119,Yeah deffo. What color truck you drive?
3119,"It's black, and has turquoise lights all around the bottom of the trailer. It's pretty cool."
3119,"Sounds great, black has always been my fave color!"
3119,Mine too! So what kind of work do you do?
3120,"Would you get tattoo of one, since they are your favourite?"
3120,"No way, I hate tattoos. Sorry if you have any. "
3120,"I do, I have an angel on my hip."
3120,"Interesting. I like zebra's, but I hate zebra pattern. "
3120,"oh you hate the pattern of a zebra, please tell me more. By the way, what school do you go to?"
3120,"animal patterns of any kind really. Pretty on the animal, look weird on people. That's what I think anyway. "
3120,"that's very, deep. That's why I like to study philosophy. I current attend umass. How about yourself?"
3120,"You wouldn't know it, it's a school for dance. "
3120,Maybe I would like to work on my dance moves. These hips don't lie of course.
3120,Shakira Shakira!
3120,"Waka, Waka, this time for Africa."
3120,"You could learn to dance like her, it's a school for Tahitian and Hawaiian dance. "
3121,"Ive never seen an apple tree in real life, I grew up in chicago."
3121,wow thats so sad. im sorry to hear that. my fav. fruit is the apple. so delicious
3121,"I love apples as well, I make an apple dessert pizza in my parlour."
3121,That should be delicious.
3121,Absolutely! I love making pizza.
3121,"Pizza is my lifeblood, along with beer."
3121,I own a pizza restaurant so its my bread and butter.
3121,I prefer New York style pizza.
3121,"Me too, as long as its crispy. But nothing beats chicago style."
3121,Argubly the most famous Chicago style pizza is the deep dish.
3121,"Absolutely, thats the kind I mostly make in my shop."
3121,do you make it from scratch ?
3122,"Luckily it can, but it's a bit expensive "
3122,"oh i love perfume, whats it smell like?"
3122,"It smells like sugar cookies, i love it"
3122,Oh that is a good one. I don't know what I would do if my perfume bottle broke with me getting married in a week!
3122,That is so exciting! How long have you been engaged? 
3122,About 5 years now. It has caused me significant distress but its worth it in the end!
3122,That is a very long engagement. What type of food will you be serving? 
3122,Lots of fish and riso and miso soup
3122,"Im extremely allergic to shellfish, and it's such a bummer because I love it"
3122,that stinks ! i have allergies to many foods so i understand that !
3122,Will there be a band or a DJ? I love dancing
3122,"Oh I always prefer DJ. Plus my dog, Bear, who is also the ring bearer loves to dance!"
3123,"It's not bad. It's not my new favorite either, though."
3123,Yea spinach is not everyone's favorite. But alfredo sauce is so yummy and creamy! Alfredo is one of my favorite things to cook!
3123,"I agree, it delicious. It's so unhealthy, though, all that butter, cream and cheese. Every once in a while it's ok, but not too often."
3123,Yes don't you agree that alfredo sauce and pasta are great comfort foods? I was learning about comfort foods in my social sciences class the other day. 
3123,"Oh, definitely. Are you in college? I'm taking online courses, my self."
3123,Yes I am studying cultural anthropology! What online course are you taking?
3123,Philisophy and a creative writing course this semester. I'm enjoying them both. How do you like cultural anthropology?
3123,"Wow those both sound like interesting courses! I really like my degree so far, but I do find college to be very difficult sometimes."
3123,"Oh, yeah. Taking online courses at least means you don't have go anywhere, but it's still a lot of work. I imagine it's even harder on a campus."
3123,Yes having to sit in class all day and then go back to do homework can be so exhausting. But at least I have met some nice classmates. 
3123,"Yeah, that's a downside to the online classes. It's just me."
3123,Do you ever have online discussions with you classmates. Like a video chat?
3124,Yes I like comic book and some of time read it. 
3124,I like to sketch comic characters in my free time.
3124,Okay man. I am also read some thriller story. 
3124,"I am a very literal person, so thrillers scare me."
3124,Okay. I am little scare to the thriller. 
3124,Me too but I love to sketch the monsters from horror and thriller movies.
3124,Wow I also man. And some of cartoon monster make me to laugh. 
3124,"Me too, especially monsters from childrens cartoons."
3124,yes man that is very big and chilly one. 
3124,"I love the monsters from Monster Inc, by Disney."
3124,Okay man. 
3124,Do you enjoy disney movies?
3125,"Yes, it has.  Hunting was a way of life for mankind for years, and it still is for some of us.  "
3125,Definitely. I have no problem with hunting if you eat what you hunt. 
3125,And I definitely do.  It saves my family money that we can spend on other things.  I also use the animals' pelts.
3125,That's great. What do you hunt?
3125,"It depends on the season.  Deer, rabbits, pheasant, wild turkeys.  Those are some of our favorites."
3125,Well-prepared venison is delicious. And pheasant if you don't break your tooth on buck shot!
3125,"Ha!  I mainly hunt with a bow, so we don't have to worry about buckshot, thank goodness!"
3125,Wow...that takes a lot of skill!
3125,I enjoy it.  I was on the archery team in high school and college. 
3125,I bet that was fun. I took archery in high school and enjoyed it.
3125,I'm glad to see it's making a comeback in popularity.  
3125,"Yes - it's a good sport, and as you said, useful for your family, too."
3126,Busy in a good way? or is it too stressful?
3126,"Usually good, but I tend to be a perfectionist and probably create more work and stress than necessary."
3126,"I just got my degree in English, so I am the same way. I always read and re-read over everything I have to write a thousand times."
3126,"Wow, that is totally me!  If anything doesn't seem right, I just keep redoing it over and over."
3126,"I like to think it is school that has made me this way in the hopes I can learn to relax, but it does feel good to get it right."
3126,I agree. Do you have a job where you get to utilize your English degree?
3126,"Does anyone? Haha, sadly no. I'm trying to find a way to write for a website, or get a blog going, but I can't seem to find time."
3126,"Definitely make sure you keep writing, no matter what it is, because it is hard to get going again."
3126,"Thanks. that's what I'm afraid of. I don't think its a ""use it or lose it"" skill, but I would hate to get rusty."
3126,"I agree that in some ways it's like riding a bike, but stick with it and who knows where it will take you."
3126,"I really appreciate your encouragement. Finding the right fit is what I'm worried about. But it will come in time, I hope."
3126,Absolutely!  Best of luck with your career and especially your writing.
3126,Thanks very much! Try not to work too hard!
3126,I'll try!  It's tough for us perfectionists at times.  :)
3127,I think I only saw it once
3127,What do you think it was a shadow of?
3127,I'm not sure!
3127,What made it so scary?
3127,It looked like a person!
3127,Were you in the kitchen cooking at the time?
3127,I was washing the dishes
3127,What had you had to eat? I am a meat lover.
3127,i like bread
3127,Do you eat meat or are you a vegatarian?
3127,I eat all food!
3127,"I hear you. Me too, but especially meat."
3128,"I like the primary colors though, nothing too crazy, mixing colors can be a pain"
3128,"Actually green is not one of the 3 primary colors, which are blue, yellow and red."
3128,"yea Blue is very close to one of my favorites, green is a secondary color though"
3128,"I see,  Did you have different colors in your room as a kid?"
3128,I had my parents paint my room blue camo for me when I was younger I enjoyed hunting even then
3128,Mine was just yellow
3128,"thats not a bad color if you find the right shade, a very happy color"
3128,"yes, it was a pale yellow, almost neutral"
3128,"oh thats not bad, bright yellow would possibly be too much, bright colors dont lend well to sleeping that for sure"
3128,yeah- it would be like sunshine
3128,yea way too bright
3128,do you like summer or fall better?
3129,"You're absolutely right, you should never assume something about someone based on their gender. I apologize, I didn't get your name?"
3129,Agreed. Assumptions can be dangerous. I'm not sure I could eat a burger that large.
3129,Have you heard the new Tool album that came out this year. It's called Fear Inoculum.
3129,"I have not. To be honest, I'm not all that familiar with Tool. Where should I start?"
3130,what kind of breakfast do you like?
3130,I love breakfast tacos and mimosas 
3130,ive never heard of a breakfast taco
3130,"It's a taco with eggs, bacon, cheese and sometimes you can get them topped with crab meat"
3130,wow that sounds amazing right now
3130,"It's so good, now i'm hungry and wish that I didn't skip breakfast especially after that hike I went on this morning "
3130,how long wasyour hike
3130,"It was about 2.5 miles, it's starting to get chilly in the mornings now"
3130,It feels so amazing! This is my favorite time of the year!
3130,"I much prefer the summer, call me crazy but i love the heat and humidity "
3130,No thank you! lol I like being bundled up
3130,"I don't enjoy being cold. The time change is coming up soon as well, it's miserable when its dark so early"
3131,"It is kinda strange, but I'm ok with it. I'm just a poor college kid with 4 cats, it could be worse LOL"
3131,"I feel that, I'm a poor college kid with 1 cat. She's really strange lol"
3131,"Most cats are, that's why I have 4, so they can all be weird together. Better than tv, LMAO"
3131,I can't wait until I can get another one; my gf is getting a kitten and we're planning playdates tho
3131,"Mine just had kittens, and we gave all 4 of them away. Was hard to let those little nuggets go!"
3131,I'm sure! Kittens are just little fuzzy balls of joy and mischief! I work with cats and dogs and sometimes kittens come in and it's the BEST time
3131,"Mischief is the EXACT word for it. They were a handful, for sure"
3131,My manager said her kitten gets into EVERYTHING and he's only one kitten; I couldn't imagine 4
3131,At least my hands are starting to heal; there was a lot of biting and scratching when I got them playing rough!
3131,Ooh I'm sure! And their teeth are all little razors so I'm sure that hurt lol
3131,"For sure. They don't know exactly how strong they are. Momma kitty was over it after 5 weeks, haha"
3131,Hahaha I'm sure she was. 
3132,English Bulldog! He's actually the star of the short film I'm currently writing lol
3132,Sweet! What is the film about?
3132,"I'm not totally sure ATM, I haven't had much inspo lately, my dad had a heart attack last month so I've been too distracted to really brainstorm"
3132,"Oh, I am so sorry. I hope he is doing better"
3132,"Thanks, I mean he's finally home which is the main thing, been pretty stressful though!"
3132,"Oh, I am sure! No doubt about that. Glad he is home. "
3132,"Thank you, you're sweet! People have been so nice and supportive, the whole family really appreciates it at a time like this"
3132,Yeah. It breaks my heart to hear of people who have loved ones going through a major illness. 
3132,I know there's nothing worse. Have you ever gone through anything similar?
3132,"No, thank goodness. And I hope I don't have to. "
3132,"Me too, you're so lucky, I hope it continues that way for you!"
3132,Thank you! 
3133,They just feel cheap to me. I felt like I would be buying a bad product.
3133,"i don't care about clothes , but i like nike shoes"
3133,I prefer work boots myself. They feel so solid.
3133,my friend got a pair . he likes them a lot .
3133,The only problem is that you cant really where them with shorts in a non work setting. It just looks odd.
3133,"hahaha Definitely! I can't get behind the long shorts, for sure!"
3133,"Yeah me either! If you want to wear long shorts, you might as well wear pants lol"
3133,haha very true ! what are some of your hobbies ?
3133,I love video games! You?
3133,i love playing video games ! all genres . you ?
3133,I love strategy and RPGs
3133,I love racing games myself. What type of food do you like?
3134,I would like to go visit Canada sometime soon
3134,Canada seems like a neat place.
3134,Yeah. Where do you live?
3134,I live in New England.
3134,"ah, so pretty close to Canada then"
3134,Not too far.  A few hours driving time
3134,I take it you don't go very often?
3134,not often but i do go
3134,That's cool. What country would you most want to visit?
3134,Ireland looks nice!  It is so green
3134,It is that! I think I would be partial to somewhere Mediterranean 
3134,That would be nice too!  
3135,She gets really upset about my hobby. 
3135,Really?  What is your hobby that she doesn't like?
3135,I'm really into comodo lizards. I like finding them on this private island that we visit.
3135,"They're cool!  I've seen them in zoos, but I've never seen one in the wild.  What doesn't your girlfriend like about that?"
3135,She thinks it is dangerous and threatens to leave me on the island. Do you have any hobbies?
3135,Yes.  I enjoying playing the drums in a local band. 
3135,That is really cool! How long have you been a member?
3135,"Of this group, about three years.  I've played with other groups off and on for about ten years though."
3135,Neat! I wish I could play an instrument. What do you do when you're not playing?
3135,"By day, I'm a high school math teacher!"
3135,Oh wow! Smart and talented. You are very successful!
3135,"Thanks.  I grew up in the Chicago projects, so I really wanted to help inner city kids because I know how they feel. "
3136,I always found Mercedes to give me more of a retired floridian vibe. Why do you prefer them?
3136,They seem reliable and well-made. I could never afford a new one though! I've always bought my cars used.
3136,Oh same here! What do you do for work?
3136,I work part time in a call center for a hospital. But what I really love to do is play jazz piano with my band on the weekends.
3136,Oh that sounds like so much fun! what is the name of your band?
3136,We call ourselves the Baked Bananas! You should come see us perform sometime. I know you'd enjoy it!
3136,I would love to! where do you all perform?
3136,"Mostly in bars, but sometimes downtown in the theater on Main Street. They serve dinner and drinks there while we play. It's very nice."
3136,I should bring my wife along as long as I can get her away from her workstation.
3136,Yes please do invite her. How is she doing these days? I know she has been very busy with work!
3136,The same old same old. She's still a hairdresser though I wish she would retire.
3136,Why doesn't she want to retire? Doesn't she get tired of being on her feet all day long?
3137,I really wish she had chosen him
3137,I think that Jacob was more or less a convenient plot twist. I did like him a lot
3137,i've never thought of him that way but it makes sense
3137,I also think that Bella was a little too dramatic. Twilight is not my favorite series.
3137,oh really? I LOVE IT
3137,My daughter loves it too. She was the main reason I started reading it and watching the movies. 
3137,the books are much better than the movie
3137,I totally agree with that. I think books usually are better than their movies.
3137,what is your favorite book turned movie? 
3137,Game of Thrones- lots of dialogue to get through in the book but the show is absolutely compelling.
3137,i've never watched it 
3137,It is a lot like watching a train wreck- once you start you can't look away! Engrossing narative.
3138,Yes some of time.
3138,That's awful! Did you hurt your foot?
3138,I am not mostly hurt with food. But often the food is not good. 
3138,What kind of food?
3138,Spicy food. 
3138,"Oh, I love spicy food. "
3138,Wow super man. I also love that but my stomach don't take it.  
3138,Yeah. Sometimes it can be too spicy.
3138,Hmm. I am always take some of vegetable. This is good for health. 
3138,Yes! Vegetables are very good for you. What are your favorite kind? 
3138,Yes man. I take green one.  
3138,Green is my favorite color. What is yours?
3139,"I was! But I'm on a diet, so I probably should stay away from pizza."
3139,Diet?  What's the diet that you're doing?
3139,"Just really balanced. Lean protein, fruit, veggies, not many carbs."
3139,Sounds like you're pretty health conscious.  Have you been like that for a while?
3139,Yes - several years. But we don't count calories on vacation :-)
3139,"Nice and balanced :)  Where do you vacation?  I love the beach, myself."
3139,"We go to Europe every year. We live in Florida close the beach, so it's not something we do on vacation."
3139,That seems like it would be a fantastic time.  You are smart to not limit your calories while there!
3139,Yes - that would be difficult! Especially in Italy!
3139,I've never been to Italy!  What's your favorite Italian food?
3139,I really love the risotto over there. It's delicious!
3139,"I've never had risotto in any country, let alone Italy!  What's your favorite dessert in Italy?"
3140,It's a bad play on words. Haha.
3140,Sounds great. How is your morning?
3140,It's going well. You? Any plans for the day?
3140,Just turkin' for a while. Have anything exciting going on there?
3140,"It's my big grocery shopping day, so I'm actually looking forward to that. Food is my life."
3140,I do love grocery shopping. What's your favorite grocery store?
3140,"Costco, hands down. They have almost everything I want, and their meats and fish are amazing quality."
3140,Fair. I do love their pizza
3140,The bake at home kind are really good. I always add a ton of stuff to them to church them up a bit.
3140,"I've never heard the phrase ""church it up,"" where does it come from?"
3140,"It's a line from the movie ""Joe Dirt."" It's silly, I know, but I thought it was a funny turn of phrase."
3140,Huh! Cool. I like learning new phrases :) Where are you from?
3140,Maryland. You?
3141,That is very impressive. I want to own a boat someday. It takes a lot of money.
3141,yeah it takes alot of money but is very impressive 
3141,How long have you owned boats? Your whole life? How often do you go boating?
3141,Over 4 years now and it will be pretty cool for you to get yours
3141,"I looked at a deck boat. During the 2008 recession, the boat makers were selling them almost at cost. "
3141,Yeah it really cost why can't you go for Bow rider boat it really cool and nice
3141,Now I don't live near the water so much so I would also need a slip -- or a truck to tow my boat.
3141,Yeah definitely you gonna need that or are you planning living where water is?
3141,No. I can't move to the water so I will be trailering the boat or storing it at a marina. 
3141,Okay. Sound nice
3141,"It is something to aspire too, for sure. "
3141,Yes very inspire and lovely 
3142,I did! I bought him a briefcase.
3142,What did your brother study?
3142,He got his MBA.  He took after our Mom; I'm following in my Dad's footsteps and studying law.
3142,"Ah, that's cool. I heard law school is super competitive."
3142,It is. I couldn't do it without self discipline and the support of my family (and my pug!)
3142,that's great ! good for you .
3142,do you have a pet?
3142,i have a dog. what about you
3142,"I said earlier, a pug (d0g)"
3142,How is your pug around others? I bet he's a great companion dog.
3143,Are there any other types of flowers you like?
3143,"I love lilies, they are my favorite. What flowers do you like?"
3143,My favorite are peonies--they're so pretty. It's a bit cold out now to be gardening though.
3143,I agree. DO you have a favorite food?
3143,Sure; my favorite food is pizza. How about yourself?
3143,"i absolutely love pizza. cheese is my favorite. I need new shoes, too."
3143,Yeah? Your current shoes just getting too ratty?
3143,Yes. Do you like Nike?
3143,Eh--they're not my favorite brand. I don't know that they're very conscientious.
3143,"I like their shoes but wish I could find their comfort elsewhere, for sure."
3143,"I'd really recommend New Balance! Not the most stylish, but they are indeed very comfortable."
3143,my friend got a pair . he likes them a lot .Thank you! I love comfort over style. do you?
3144,"OK I'll take your word for it, haha"
3144,"yeah trust me, everyone who meets me knows I'm a total nerd lol!"
3144,There's nothing wrong with being a little nerdy!
3144,I know right! Like how could being an ace at science and math be a bad thing??! I'm proud that I am haha
3144,Not me. I'm doing good to read stories to my nephew before bed. It reminds me of when my mom read to me.
3144,Ah that's too cute! I hope you're reading him a science book?? haha
3144,"Yes, we prefer fact to fiction....hence why no religious propaganda is in my household."
3144,So whats the book about?? The nerd in me is curious now!
3144,"Not STEM, hahahaha. He is only 3, so nothing too scientific quite yet."
3144,"haha ok ok, since he's only three I suppose I'll let you off then!"
3144,"He's smart for 3. Rather have lobster than pizza. Smart kid! I'm jealous, I'm allergic to seafood."
3144,"Oh no that's too bad! I couldn't live without my weekly seafood paella, it's my all time fave dish"
3145,"Oh not usually, she uses them to sell eggs. They are an investment so to speak "
3145,It seems like taking care of chickens would be time intensive. Seems like a lot of work.
3145,"They are pretty easy actually. I love chickens, you just need to make sure to give them food and keep the fence mended"
3145,That makes sense. Upkeep on property seems to be a key to any venture really.
3145,"Or anything really, I am constantly working on my rig. My two passions in life, chickens and truck driving "
3145,Very cool. My passion is the hospitality industry. I used to be heavily involved in it.
3145,"I consider myself an expert in the hospitality industry, i run a B&B at my chicken farm  "
3145,Interesting! Do you serve fresh eggs to the guests?
3145,I certainly do! I even offer rides in the big rig. It's a real hit.
3145,Do you ever worry that your business won't be able support itself?
3145,"Not really, two things I know will never go out of style, omelettes and cross country delivery  "
3145,Hah! I would add gambling to that list.
3146,I am not sure which episode it is. My mom just made me get braces. ICK!
3146,when i was young my mom made me get braces ugh
3146,I look ridiculous and food is getting stuck in the brackets. I hate them.
3146,I know its hard now! Just think how beautiful your teeth will look afterwards
3146,Everybody in homeroom is laughing at me. 
3146,Dont let there laughs bother you! Laugh with them and fimd something to laugh about it. 
3146,"I guess. Mostly I like to draw to escape from them. I like to draw ponies, my three ring binder is filled with my drawings."
3146,try to find something to laugh about. when u realize u can it gets easier
3146,I will try that. I am going to have these braces for a while so I might as well make the best of it.
3146,i had mine for almost 4 years!!! ugh it was horrible
3146,Picture day is not fun- I am a brace face!
3146,own those braces and look beautiful! confidence is key to everything baby girl
3147,"I'm going to Charleston this weekend. I'm trying to get started as a singer, and hopefully I have a job lined up."
3147,That sounds exciting! What type of music do you sing?
3147,"Oh, anything. I'm not in a position to be picky right now. I got started with my church choir, though."
3147,That's nice that you have an open genre. I tend to read more in my spare time.
3147,So what about you? Any plans for this weekend?
3147,Not really anything planned. Probably just play it by ear.
3147,"A weekend off, nothing to complain about. I'm looking forward to my trip, but it's exhausting."
3147,Oh I'm sure. Is the location far from you?
3147,"It's a few hours away. It should be a beautiful drive, though. Fall is definitely my favorite time of year."
3147,"Oh, that will be a long drive. Will you be taking any breaks for sight seeing?"
3147,Maybe. I'm not sure I'll have the time. Are the leaves turning yet where you are?
3147,"No not yet, I live in a warm climate."
3148,"Luckily, I found an instrument that was more my calling. "
3148,"Wow you played piano, that's really interesting, please tell me more."
3148,"It helped me learn to read music, but that was about all I got out of it. I play the guitar now. "
3148,"I can't play in a band, people don't like me too much. As much as I like them."
3148,"I am the same way, that's why I just play solo. Have you ever played an instrument?"
3148,I played piano like yourself. I prefer to use my hands for other things.
3148,Do you still play?
3148,"Not any more, I started to take up religion instead, there is something about using my hands satisfied my need to use my hands."
3148,Do you feel you have a strong urge to use your hands?
3148,"Yeah, I find that having my hands moving around keeps me calm. also I like watching people pray."
3148,"That's different. Sounds relaxing. That's why I like playing music, it's relaxing. "
3149,I just got an implala love the car thats for sure
3149,"I had my dad's old company car as my first car, it was an 08 Impala. I really liked it!"
3149,I did a lot of reading on them to make sure I got the car I wanted
3149,"That's good. I wish I didn't have the car I had, but it was at the price I wanted"
3149,yea sometimes you have to go with the cheaper options
3149,"Eventually I'll get a new one, so I need to take care of this one now"
3149,"yea, parts and maintenance can be a pain in the wallet"
3149,"Definitely a major pain in the wallet, especially when ends are barely meeting lol"
3149,"yea about the same here, I spend most of my nights at home reading to avoid spending money going out."
3149,yea thats probably a smart move; I do the same
3149,at least I enjoy it...I couldnt imagine if I didnt how bored I would be 
3149,Yeah for sure. I also just dont like going out
3150,"What kind of ""random things""?"
3150,i create art and i find art. what do you do?
3150,"I am a baristo. Do the fairs you work at sell coffee? Or better yet, nachos? (My fav food)"
3150,"Some of them do! I love nachos, as well. Why are they your favorite food?"
3150,"I don't know...it's just cheesy, salty goodness."
3150,"I can see why, they are delicious! Nachos usually consists of tortilla chips covered with cheese and sometimes salsa."
3150,"That's correct. I do know this, as I eat them all the time. Do you eat them with sour cream?"
3150,Yes! I love sour cream too! i want to start a mexican food business.
3150,What about a Mexican food truck?
3150,"You have a good idea! Baby steps, however."
3150,Any specific type of Mexican or just general?
3150,i do not like tex-mex really. I like authentic mexican food. What is your favorite color?
3151,I'm looking forward to the casinos! Hopefully I can help a few people if i win big!
3151,i guess that's why you signed up for my class . are you new to vegas ?
3151,"Not yet, our flight doesn't leave until thurday."
3151,It seems Estonian didn't work on Thursday.  So a long weekend I guess.
3151,Perfect timing on it too. Less work means I have more time to work hard on trying to make this world a better place
3151,exactly
3151,You have any plans for the weekend?
3151,yes going to vegas
3151,What are you going to do once out there?
3151,"Gambling, shopping, dining, and maybe go out clubbing."
3151,That all sounds like fun. Busy weekend!
3151,It would seem even more like nothing if I was on vacation. Have you ever heard of Nothing Records?
3152,I enjoy just about any carb
3152,"So do I, to be honest. My best friend is trying the keto diet, and I don't know how he does it."
3152,That does sound pretty awful. Remember when Atkins was all the rage?
3152,"I do. I love meat too though, but I could never be so limited in my diet. I need a bit of everything."
3152,"Agreed, although I've never had much of a sweet tooth. What's your favorite food?"
3152,I hate sweets! Picking a favorite food is tricky. Grill-roasted standing prime rib is pretty close to perfect though.
3152,Nice. Pasta is my main weakness
3152,"I love pasta. I make a really great lasagna, and I know how to make my own pasta from scratch."
3152,"Nice! I got a pasta maker last Christmas and I've only used it a few times, unfortunately. Very time consuming"
3152,"It is, but I think it's worth it. It is really good for special occasions or to impress a date. haha."
3152,"Hahaha, smart idea to be sure. And I genuinely think it tastes better fresh"
3152,It does. It can make a great recipe or a great meal that much better. Like how really good bread can make a good sandwich amazing..
3153,Ear protection doesn't let me get in the right state of mind. Some 90's grunge. A mix between The Cranberries and Nirvana 
3153,I love the Seattle scene! Those are my kind of people!
3153,Yeah it's pretty chill. My sister and I are killin it on the underground scene. I'm thinking we could be the next Alanis Morissette
3153,Well I certainly hope so for your sake. It would be amazing to play music for a living.
3153,"Its really awesome, living the life. Both of our parents are teachers and they wanted us to follow suit. What about you?"
3153,I'm an activist. I work for non profits
3153,That's really noble of you. What are you fighting for?
3153,I work for animal rights. Specifically animals on farms.
3153,No way! That's so cool of you. I own a chicken farm with a B&B on it. 
3153,Do you treat your animals well?
3153,Of course. My chickens are part of the family. We sell the eggs and use them at the B&B. They come up and hang out with guests
3153,That's great! As long as they are well fed and have plenty of room to roam around. I love it.
3154,"Yeah, broke college student is the truest stereotype there is"
3154,"What other jobs do you do, if anything? Or are you too busy studying?"
3154,I work on campus and also at a doggie daycare/boarding place
3154,My mother has a very active dog. I hear dog day care can be helpful.
3154,"Definitely! If they like other dogs, it can be great for them to get that energy out"
3154,I assume you like dogs?
3154,Indeed! I grew up around dogs. But I'm also a cat fan!
3154,I'm definitely more of a dog person. 
3154,I get that. I was too until I started working with cats 
3154,Do you have either a dog or a cat.
3154,I have a cat. Rescued her about 6 months ago now
3154,From a shelter?
3155,"He does that. He has work clothes, lounge clothes and athletic clothes."
3155,yeah women love a nice dressed man .
3155,"He shops more than I do. I don't like crowds, but he loves to shop."
3155,Where do you shop? I can't find appropriate items since my partner is a pastor.
3155,We go to the Men's Warehouse and Joseph A. Banks
3155,"I love those places, they are so clean. I personally have a hard time keeping the house clean. "
3155,Me too. We have a lot of pets so dander and pet hair become a problem.
3155,Do you know of a solution for it? does those HEPA filter really work?
3156,It's an exciting career to have for sure. Do you live near water?
3156,"I live near the beach, yes. So, I enjoy swimming. And, when I'm done, I like to come in and enjoy my favorite drink...chocolate milk."
3156,"Chocolate milk after swimming, I feel like that would hurt my stomach! "
3156,"Not going to lie, it takes some getting used to. But its satisfying after a long swim in the waves."
3156,"I'm glad it works for you! I have to go visit my parents soon before work, they are both over 100 years old."
3156,"Wow, thats impressive, what is their secret?"
3156,I have no idea! But I do check on them often
3156,Make sure you tell them you love them when you see them next! :)
3156,I do all the time. As well as my wife who is deaf.
3156,Do your parents know sign language
3156,"They know a little bit that we have taught them over the years. My wife doesn't visit as much, so they rarely need to use it anymore."
3156,"aw , that's great , i am so glad they visit you often ."
3157,"Well, since I apparently only have 6 months left on this earth (well, so my doctor says) it makes me feel like getting a dog myself while I still can!"
3157,"with only having six months left to live , every day i wake up is good ."
3157,"I know, I wake up with a smile every single day (though it's hard to tell, my husband tells me I'm just terrible at regular facial expressions lol)"
3157,That's natural. Just don't tell him lol. You'll be alright buddy.
3157,"haha, thanks, it's nice to talk to someone friendly about this sort of stuff, I appreciate it!"
3157,You're welcome. :)
3157,hows everything with you these days?
3157,Well - everything is going well so far.
3157,"ah that's good, where are you living at the moment?"
3157,"I live in Houston, TX."
3157,"That's cool, hows the weather haha"
3157,"The weather is usually warm. Today, it's raining. "
3158,That is neat! I have never heard of that job.
3158,"It can be hard work at times , too relax I like walking my dog .."
3158,I have 2 dogs.  They like the dog parks
3158,"I also study in the evenings - you said you are a student , do you work as well?"
3158,I have a part time job at a store 
3158,Thats good - it must keep you active - what sort of store is it?
3158,"Just a local drug store, nothing too exciting"
3158,I undersftand  but at least it helps with the bills! Its friday today and I am hoping the weather gets better for the weekend!
3158,"Yep, looking forward to getting out and hiking.  Do you like the outdoors?"
3158,yes. I love the outdoors.
3158,This is a nice time of the year to go out and hike.  I love the fall. 
3158,So do i - sadly I am limited too were my wheelchair can get me now 
3159,By who please?
3159,"Albert Gallatin, who was secretary of treasury under President's Jefferson and Madison, was the founder."
3159,I wish to know when the white house was built?
3159,"It was built 1792, and finished in 1800. But it was mostly burned down by the British during the was of 1812"
3159,What are the basic usage of Osteopathic medicine?
3159,Sure. Osteopathy is a type of alternative medicine. It focuses on physical manipulation of bones/tissue.
3159,What causes bones/tissue manipulations?
3159,IT places an emphasis on things like readjustments and manipulations of muscle and bone.
3160,"I live in the south and enjoy good weather, most of the time. Where do you live?"
3160,i live in ca . it is perfect here . we do not get seasons much though .
3160,That is such a beautiful state with lots of good rules.
3160,What do you mean lots of good rules?
3160,"mostly, the recreational rules. I worked in San Francisco for a short while and loved it."
3160,"San Fran is nice to visit but too expensive too live there, in my opinion"
3160,"Yes, I agree and it is really expensive."
3160,"Yes, I currently work as a receptionist, it's not very well paying -- I can afford N. Cali but in SF I'd have to live in a box or something."
3160,I understand and I live in the south where the cost of living is more reasonable.
3160,Yeah thats true. Maybe I'll move down there when I finish my studies.
3160,We have the seasons as well as friendly and polite people.
3160,I wonder if I could get a radiology tech job there easier than in Cal when I get my certificate
3161,My mom said I couldn't play soccer this weekend if I didn't clean my room.
3161,"You better get cleaning then! If my mom tried to stop me doing yoga my room would be sparkling clean quick time, I love it too much to miss it!"
3161,"That's how I feel about soccer, drawing and reading asterix! My friend helped me feel better thoguh"
3161,"I'm not fussed about drawing, or reading really, but writing - oh that's where my passion lies right there haha"
3161,What do you like to write about?
3161,"Mainly fiction, I just love fantasy. Are you a writer too?"
3161,I'm only in 3rd grade so my writing isn't that good. I like to try though!
3161,"Ah keep up the good work, never too young to start, it's the practise that makes the perfect!"
3161,Thank you for the encouragement!
3161,"You're welcome! Always follow your passion in life, keep drawing too, I wish I was more artistic!"
3161,Anyone can be artistic! Just like writing it all comes down to practice!
3161,"Haha yep totally, I should take my own advice shouldn't I?!"
3162,"It's in history class, and I do not do well in history."
3162,History was not one of my better subjects either.  I was a math/science fan.  Is it an AP class?
3162,"I'm good with math as well. No it's not, I could not handle an AP class. Do you have any plans for today?"
3162,Not really any plans today.  Not very nice outside. 
3162,"Same here actually. After I study probably going to watch my favorite movie, Goodfellas."
3162,I love that movie.
3162,Nice! Probably just have a laid back night with my parents. They've been married for 40 years.
3162,That is quite awhile!  My parents have been married for 35
3162,That's great!
3162,I hope I am able to find someone and stay married that long
3162,I agree! Must be nice to be so secure in a relationship.
3162,"Definitely, are you married?"
3163,"I am, you?"
3163,only a few blocks from the browns stadium
3163,No way! Are you a fan?
3163,"No, I really dont follow sports much."
3163,What do you follow? 
3163,I am a UFC fan.
3163,Do you fight? Or just watch? 
3163,I've dabbled in MMA a little.
3163,Cool
3163,Do you like UFC?
3163,"Not really, to gentle for that."
3163,"Oh okay, It's not for everyone."
3164,Oh they shouldn't be. It wasn't like I did it for fun. I did it to live. 
3164,oh then what would you say
3164,"To your family in new york? That you know someone who was almost killed by a lion, but shot it instead. "
3164,i feel bad for the parents then
3164,I do too. But I'll make clay models of the lion in its honor. Make him king of the pride when I play
3164,haha i guess if its a lion
3164,It will be. A very nice lion. 
3164,i'll make a clay model in the honor of the lion
3164,That will be really nice of you. 
3164,they might make fun of me though
3164,Why would they make fun of you for that? There's nothing shameful about it. 
3164,i guess maybe they do not like it
3165,No kidding. I'd lose my mind
3165,"Agreed!   Spiders, especially big ones can be scary!"
3165,You know what else is scary? Green beans. I absolutely hate them
3165,Really?    Vegetables can be quite tasty when cooked properly.
3165,I've never had any I like. Something about the texture bothers me.
3165,Perhaps you should try juices then.     Vitamins are necessary.
3165,Maybe. Hey do you like watching tv? I watch a lot of game shows because i like them
3165,I like to watch reality television.
3165,To each their own. reality tv can be entertaining
3165,True.    I also find History shows entertaining.
3165,"Oh i do like those, they're fascinating"
3165,Yes.    Learning about the past tells us about the future!
3166,I live in the midwest on a small farm.
3166,I was reared on a farm and have some great memories.
3166,"That's awesome, where did you grow up?"
3166,"On a cotton farm near Memphis, TN."
3166,"Nice, I operate a cattle farm here in Michigan."
3166,"That's cool, does the anti-meat thing worry you?"
3166,"Not so much, I don't think it will affect business so much."
3166,That's good and I hope you do well.
3166,"Thanks, what kind of work do you do?"
3166,I am a corporate controller in manufacturing.
3166,"Very cool, do you enjoy the work that you do?"
3166,"Yes, a lot and I like working with people to help our business, succeed."
3167,That seems pretty interesting. I graduated from college last year.
3167,That's great. What was your major or you field of study?
3167,I got a degree in Computer Science. I'm currently working in IT at a hospital and am starting my own small business on the side.
3167,I think that's great to be in the medical field. What kind of small business are you trying to get started?
3167,I'm starting my own IT business. I do some consulting for a few small businesses and am trying to get my client base up.
3167,I see. Building a client base is challenging at times. It is a big part of accounting as well.
3167,"Yep, it's definitely challenging, especially for a young introvert like myself."
3167,Well it all starts with confidence in your quality of work. If you are proud of what you can accomplish that's the best sales pitch.
3167,Yeah that's true. I just hate talking to people at times. It's something I have to grow out of.
3167,"I understand that completely. It just takes practice, honestly. When you get older, you usually get better at talking to people. I know I have."
3167,"Yeah I can see that. It's gotten better since I've started in ""the real world."""
3167,"Talking to people in person is definitely the most difficult, but also the best practice you can get. Thinking on your feet is irreplaceable."
3168,Because of where we live. We live on a pig farm and it was far away so i didnt get there in time
3168,That sounds disappointing. Do you have any pets? 
3168,We do. Pigs obviously. They're just pets though because I'm a vegetarian
3168,I have some pets as well. Have you ever tried before bacon?
3168,"No I haven't, is it good?"
3168,"Yes, crunch and delicious. Have you always been a vegetarian or just recently?"
3168,always been. I just like animals too much
3168,What is your favorite animal?
3168,Tiger
3168,Oh wow have you ever seen a tiger in the wild?
3168,"Yes I have, I was killed by one last year"
3168,You were killed? Am I talking to a ghost then?
3169,"Well, I mean anything you grow yourself is going to be organic. Right now I'm growing kale and radishes."
3169,that's  cool. does that mean you eat don't eat anything but radishes and kale? lol jk i love gardening myself.
3169,"I might eat a few other things. You grow vegetables too, or a different kind of gardening?"
3169,nah i don't grow anything at all. i just buy certified organic stuff. I'd love to have a small vegetable garden someday though 
3169,"It's pretty easy. You can actually things like radishes and greens in pots or a window box pretty easily, if you want to start small."
3169,That does sound fun. I could something like that on weekends. Have you ever grown berries? 
3169,"I have a couple of blueberry bushes, actually, but I've never gotten a single berry. I think maybe it's too warm here."
3169,oh okay. that's a bummer.  i absolutely love berries. I'd be pretty cool if i could grow some. Where do you live?
3169,"I'm in South Carolina. I could probably grow great peaches. How about you, where do you live?"
3169,maryland. I did see a YouTube video of a dude having a great garden with all kind of berries. I should be able to grow them i think.
3169,"Yeah, I think you might do really well. I think the best blueberries come from Maine, so you're closer to the right area."
3169,You seem to know quite a bit about all these gardening stuff. Is it your passion? 
3169,"It's a hobby. I'm allergic to dust, so I try to spend a lot of time outside."
3170,"I took him to a basketball game, it's my favorite sport to watch. We made out at halftime"
3170,So are you and your husband in an open relationship then?
3170,Yeah a little bit. It all started when he bought a ford and I bought a ferrari. Its my favorite car company. We couldnt see eye to eye
3170,Oh ok.. I was scared for a minute there.  Congratulations on your successful relationship! LOL
3170,"Either way, I have a ferrari so I dont care"
3170,It's time to one up him and get a Porsche!
3170,Ferrari is better than Porsche. I think I'm going to go for a lamborghini
3170,I think that Lamborghinis are much better sports cars than Ferraris.
3170,"I agree, but the one I want is really pricey"
3170,"true , they can be just as expensive lol ."
3170,I like to go fast though
3170,One day you will own many cars.
3171,"No I haven't. I was going to learn about them at a morning dance class, but I never made it cause I hate waking up early."
3171,Waking up early is tough for me too. Maybe a different dance studio will have afternoon or evening classes you could try.
3171,"perhaps. I want to dance in my apartment, but I'm scared because i use candles instead of lights and i might knock one over"
3171,"I understand. Dancing in your home makes it easier to let loose, however to get the steps down - you may want to try a class. "
3171,"I'll consider it, thanks for the recommendation"
3171,"No problem. Once you have the steps, you can dance all you want in your apartment without fear of knocking over candles!"
3171,True. Last thing I need is a fire hazard
3171,Agree! Fires are what I am terrified of most.
3171,Oh really? I hate spiders
3171,Spiders I can kill! Fires are harder for me. But everyone's got their own fears. It is interesting.
3171,Indeed it is.
3171,"Funny that I am afraid of fires, yet I work on food trucks - which seem to be more fire hazards than a typical place. "
3172,That's awesome.
3172,Yeah. Have you ever rode horses? I like to ride the horses I train. 
3172,"I actually wish I did, but I'm afraid of falling off one."
3172,That's understandable. What do you do for fun?
3172,I like drawing in general. I draw comics in my spare time sometimes.
3172,That's so cool and creative!
3172,"Yes, very relaxing also. "
3172,"That's wonderful. To relax I like watching movies, usually snacking on popcorn while I watch."
3172,"Cool, I love movies also. What's your favourite movie?"
3172,I  love Inception! and other mind-unraveling movies. What about yours?
3172,Good pick! Hmm.. my favourite movie is Stoker.
3172,Stoker! I don't know about that one. I'll have to check that out! 
3172,"If you like weird psychological movies, you'll love that one."
3172,"I'll have to check it out, thanks for the rec! I've been meaning to add more things to my "
3172,You're welcome hope you enjoy it!
3173,No probs! son or daughter? I only have my fur-babies (my two kittens) no kids at the mo!
3173,I have 3 kids from 3 wives. Holidays are a nightmare. They are 2 boys 1 girl.
3173,"Nothing better than cuddling in bed with the kitties, but guess it isn't easy for you to get all 3 of your babies in once place at the same time!"
3173,Not at all! What are your cat's names?
3173,"Pip and Pop :-) they even have their own facebook and twitter accounts (I know, I spend far too much time on there but I can't help it!)"
3173,That's really cute! My kids spend far too much time on social media
3173,It's so addictive isn't it! What are your kids' names?
3173,"Benjamin, James, and Phoenix. They are all a handful!"
3173,Haha I bet! Gorgeous names though :-)
3173,Thank you! It may not seem like it but I swear I love them lol
3173,"Oh I know you do, they just test you don't they - or that's what my mom always said about me and my sisters!"
3173,How many sisters do you have?
3174,"Meh, Edward was no good in my opinion. But otherwise Twilight is my favorite series of books."
3174,"I think the Eclipse was my favorite book, when she falls in love with the werewolf and was split between Edward and him."
3174,Yeah. What else do you do for fun?
3174,I enjoy watching anime and researching different reptiles
3174,What kind of reptiles?
3174,"i like to research ball pythons, blue tongued skinks, and leopard geckos "
3174,"Wow. That's pretty interesting. Me, I like to surf. Well, I'm learning. I only surf at low tide."
3174,surfing looks scary to me . do you have to be an excellent swimmer ?
3174,"Well, at least decent, you can't not swim and surf. It's a little scary at first."
3174,"i think my kids would love to surf, i will have to introduce it to them when they visit me again"
3174,How many kids do you have?
3174,"i have 2 kids, jenny and jackson, they are the best kids ever, even with their busy lives they find time to visit me"
3175,I love Golden Retrievers! I used to have a black lab.
3175,Well you picked a great one :) Love labs.  My friend's got a big one he just attacks me with love everytime I see him
3175,They are really awesome dogs. I have a Pitbull puppy that's looking at me funny right now. He gets annoyed at how fast I type. lol
3175,awww haha.. Do you like Rottweilers?
3175,"Definitely, but I had an incident with one. I have an extra thumb and my friends Rot thought it was weird I guess so he bit it. haha"
3175,That's unfortunate. How did that situation go?
3175,"I had to get a few stitches. Nothing serious. I can still type at least 140 words per minute, so it doesn't affect my work."
3175,"That's good, I'm glad it wasn't serious. Had me worried there for a minute."
3175,"Haha, thanks. So what do you do for a living? I'm a data entry worker."
3175,I am a Youtuber and Twitch Gamer. I love entertaining. Data entry sounds cool.
3175,Oh cool! I just made a Twitch account last week and have a small YT channel to promote underground music.
3175,What is the name of your band?
3176,"That's too bad. If you don't mind me asking, how come?"
3176,We just don't get along for some reason.  I'm kind of a loner.  I live by myself. 
3176,I'm sorry. My family doesn't really talk to me anymore since I've gotten some tattoos. 
3176,Oh my!  That seems like a silly reason to stop talking to someone. 
3176,I know! And I only got them on my toes. So it's not like they really see them. 
3176,"I'm surprised you even told them about the tattoos, if they're that against them and can't see them."
3176,I had no choice. They saw them when we went to the beach over the summer. 
3176,"Ah.  I don't have any tattoos myself, but I  have nothing against other people having them.  My husband has two."
3176,What kind of tattoos does he have?
3176,"He has a dragon on one arm and a skull on the other.  He was really young when he got them, lol."
3176,Those sound cool! I'd really like to get more. I love tattoos
3176,What are your tattoos of?
3177,Its more the traffic and the risk getting hit. I have a sensitive stomach and hate stress and anxiety
3177,I completely understand.  I get pretty aggravated myself driving home from work everynight.
3177,Not to mention most of my drive right now is construction zones. Do you work every day?
3177,"Yea construction zones are crazy, and No I don't work everyday. I do have somedays off lol."
3177,"Lucky, I work every day as a veternarian, but I love my job, so it doesnt feel like work everyday"
3177,lucky you. I hate my job and me being  six feet tall being the tallest person there doesn't make it any better.
3177,Are you bullied at work because of your height?
3177,I wouldn't call it being bullied it just really noticeable.  I hate being the center of attention. 
3177,"Oh I can understand that. My coworkers judge me too, because I happen to be a vegan so dinner outings can be an inconvenience"
3177,"Yes, it's said but  it could be worse. So  what do you like to do on your free time?"
3177,I like to volunteer my time at the children's hospital with one of my two cats for therapy
3177,Oh cool. That's very kind of you.  I know I love spending my time at the opera!   I love it.
3178,How old are your kids?
3178,"I have two families. One daughter 59, a son 55 and another son 34. I have grandchildren 34,24, 4 and 18 months."
3178,Do you have any pets?
3178,"I don't, but my younger son has two dogs that I get to play with a lot."
3178,I have a dog too! He is my best friend.
3178,They are such loving animals and I really enjoy being around them.
3178,"The best part is going for long walks with them around the neighborhood, enjoying the cool air."
3178,"Yes and I like feeding, watering, and caring for them, too."
3178,I have owned a total of five dogs over the years. I wish they lived as long as we do.
3178,"Yeah, they only want us to love and care for them. I have owned two, also."
3178,"My dog's name is Skywalker, named after the legendary Jedi family from Star Wars. What's your dog's name?"
3178,We have a Norman and a Mabel.
3179,"Oh, I did. And I had made many more friends after that. "
3179,That's great! The few friends I have are from the law firm I work at. 
3179,Oh! Are you a lawyer?
3179,"Nah...just a clerk. Though I do like to golf like the ""big boys"" do lol!"
3179,"Oh, that's too bad. But, I'm sure it's fun to go golfing with them. "
3179,Oh they don't play with me! What do you do for work?
3179,Oh shhucks. lol. I work at a hotel as a cleaning lady. It takes me forever to clean one room because I need everything perfect. lol
3179,Much respect to you! I couldn't do that-I hate cleaning!
3179,I love cleaning. I actually start earlier then I am supposed to so I can get as much done and work until late at night. 
3179,Thats a really smart plan-except for working late at night
3179,"Yeah, but I have no one to go home to anyway, so it's no big deal. "
3179,"Me either-I'm a widow, but, have 3 cats."
3180,"No, she's still alive, she just moved. She's living in Alaska now."
3180,"oh that is fun, i hear it is really cold up there"
3180,"Yeah, I haven't visited yet, but I'm looking forward to it. I'll wait for summer, though."
3180,well i hope you two get to spend a lot of time together when you go see her
3180,"Me too. It's supposed to be beautiful. I'd love to go hiking in the parks up there. How about you, do you travel much?"
3180,"i do not travel much, but i occasionally will travel with my soccer team"
3180,"Oh, yeah? Is that a hobby, or like a school team?"
3180,no just for fun i am not very good at it for a team
3180,"You're better than I am. I like watching sports, but I had enough of the last one picked for the team stuff when I was in school."
3180,"i don't enjoy watching sports all that much, i just find it fun to go out there and give it my best shot"
3180,"Well, I'll stay on the sidelines and cheer. Have you gone anywhere interesting with your team, or are you mostly local?"
3180,"we have visited peru once! It was so beautiful there, i hope i get the chance to go again"
3180,"Oh, hey, I've been there! I visited Macchu Picchu. You're right, it's gorgeous."
3180,Wow! I've wanted to visit Machu Picchu since Spanish 1 in high school.
3181,Have they begun doing any research on it where you are?
3181,"Yes. I think it will become a reality soon. What about you? What's your favorite season, for example?"
3181,"I love fall, you are able to enjoy out door activities without worrying about heat stroke or getting ill from the strong cold."
3181,I think they will start having auto driving cars soon.
3181,"Yes, and with my new job I see just how soon, another great thing about fall is that I work outside. What season do you like."
3181,"I like winter the most. I like fall second best, What's your favorite?"
3181,Fall. Do you like games of logic like chess?
3181,"not really , i'm much more passionate about cooking than chess ."
3181,Cooking can be good but baking with it's exact amounts is better to me.
3181,"I prefer to improvise, so I like cooking better"
3181,What else do you enjoy doing
3181,"Hunting, fishing and computers."
3182,"I do like to play music, but I LOVE cooking.  Do you love to cook?"
3182,"I love to cook, it is soothing to me. I also like stamps and bass guitars."
3182,"I have found cooking to be soothing as well, and then to be able to provide comfort food is wonderful.  What do you like about stamps?"
3182,Just all the different types of stamps you can collect over the years. What is your favorite type of food to cook?
3182,I love to cook Indian food since my father was from India.  I also love to bake cakes and cookies.
3182,So do you like all sorts of spicy food?
3182,"I don't like a lot of spice in my food, but like butter chicken and mild chicken curry.  Do you like spicy food"
3182,"Yes, my favorite food is chicken wings The spicier the better."
3182,What kind of music do you like?
3182,"Classic Rock is my favorite, especially 70's and 80's. What is your favorite?"

3183,what major you graduated with?
3183,Psychology
3183,how do you like Psychology...
3183,It was always my favorite subject. Did you go to university?
3183,"yes, went for computer engineering"
3183,That's a good field. I was never good with computers.
3183,I was never good at psychology.. :)
3183,It's good we both found our fields then!
3183,that's right.. but I always interested in Psychology.. specially when one of my close family member ran into some psychologica issues...
3183,Oh what happened to them?
3183,"she was having something called ""panic attack"".. "
3184,"Just being in the water in general is where I wanna be, I swear if I were to be reincarnated I'd come back as a hippopotamus haha!"
3184,Lol! Why a hippo? I'm very curious! I couldn't surf as a hippo.
3184,Just chilling out in the water seems like the best life! Add some ice tea and some Lindsey Stirling music playing in the background and it'd be bliss!
3184,For sure. I've never been better relaxing with a glass of iced tea in the water!
3184,"absolutely, can't get enough of her music - or ice tea!! What animal would you come back as??"
3184,I would come back as an Eagle. I would love to be so free to be able to fly anywhere I wish with great views!
3184,Oh that's a good one! Yes if i wasn't coming back as a hippo it'd have to be something that could fly for sure!
3184,Absolutely! That would be amazing.
3184,My husband has always said he'd come back as a sloth - I said he's not far off one in real life lol
3184,"I'm sure he didn't take that well! lol I would say my husband is like a bear, always eat and sleeping but great for body heat!"
3184,haha at least you get some peace and quiet when he hibernates for the winter!
3184,"You're probably right, as long as he's not snoring so loudly as he usually does. It's like living with a muffler"
3185,oh that's cool. how come Indian though? i have tried Indian food. so many different flavors! 
3185,"My dad is Indian, he brought a lot of recipes from my grandmother when he moved here."
3185,that's nice.I have tried Dosa i think.  Do you know how to make them? Absolutely loved it. 
3185,"Yes, I make them for my kids often.  It's one of their favorite breakfasts!"
3185,That's awesome. I gather your mom is greek. You been to india or greece? 
3185,"Yes, I've been to India several times, and Greece once."
3185,nice. How was your experience?  
3185,They've been great! I hope to go back to India soon.  Have you been to either?
3185,I have been to India once for a friend's wedding. It was intense. In a good way. Had lots of fun. 
3185,Awesome!  It is a very long trip.  Did you go with your family?
3185,nah. it was a friend's wedding like i said. I did go sight seeing actually. In jaipur. 
3185,"Oh, the City Palace is beautiful in Jaipur!  I have been a few times."
3185,yeah. I know! We played with c olors too. It was an awesome experience. Anyway bye !
3186,What kind of business are you getting started? 
3186,It's an online retail business. Something I've always wanted to start but I finally just pulled the trigger.
3186,I recently had a business like that but had to shut it down because of traveling and not having time anymore
3186,"Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that! At least you're able to travel more now."
3186,"Yeah, it just gets kind of boring. You know? I just sit around in Hotel rooms all day. "
3186,I hear you! Have you thought about starting an online side business that you can manage while you're traveling?
3186,I have! I tried to look into what it would take to start a drop shipping styled business 
3186,That's awesome! I've heard a lot about drop shipping but don't fully understand it.
3186,Yeah that how I was at first about it but i did some research and its actually really simple 
3186,Hm maybe I'll have to do some more research on it. Sounds like an interesting business model.
3186,AND if it really makes money like everyone claims it does. youd be set. 
3186,That would be great! Maybe some day in the future!
3187,Hi! How are you?
3187,Great and how are you
3187,I'm pretty good. Looking forward to this weekend. 
3187,I won't be doing much since I broke my arm.
3187,That's sad. I hope you get better soon. I'll be playing football with friends this weekend. 
3187,It's been a few months since the skiing accident but I don't want to risk another injury. Are you the QB?
3187,We rotate the assignments. Sometimes I am. I've never been skiing. 
3187,I enjoy the highest hill to ski down even though I am terrified of heights. I like playing flag football because you don't tackle.
3187,I like that too. 
3187,You should try sledding first unless you are positive you aren't afraid of heights. 
3187,I'm not afraid and that sounds like fun. 
3187,Just make sure to wear a helmet and proper gear
3188,That's cool.  What position did you play?
3188,I'm a forward like Abby Wambach.
3188,"Awesome!  So, you still play?"
3188,"Yes, I do. I don't think I will ever stop playing. "
3188,"That's great.  I've hopped from hobby to hobby since high school.  I love animals though, so I've recently started petsitting."
3188,Sounds like a great hobby. I could see this being an activity I'd do for enjoyment.
3188,"It's really very rewarding.  I get to spend time with animals, and it also helps me meet new peope."
3188,That's always a good thing. And I am sure taking care of the pets keeps you in a good mood. 
3188,"Definitely!  I was feeling really giddy last week, so I decided to dye my hair purple!  The animals don't mind, lol."
3188,Oh my gosh! I just dyed my hair purple too! 
3188,That's an amazing coincidence! 
3188,I know! I guess purple is a very popular color right now. 
3189,"I used to play soccer, how about you? "
3189,"i do play soccer, i am a goalie"
3189,Really that's awesome! Are you on a team at school?
3189,yes i play on our senior team for my high school
3189,"I think being the goalie is probably the hardest position, lots of pressure."
3189,that is true ! they're tough
3189,Definitely! I bet it's rewarding though!
3189,yes it definitely is !
3189,How long have you played?
3189,It's been about 5 years now. I've learned so much since I first started.
3189,It's great being apart of  a team. Think you'll play in college too?
3189,do you play any sports?
3190,"Oh, that is interesting. I still don't like running. "
3190,It's not for everyone. I just like the strategy and slow pace of the game. It is so serene.
3190,Want to talk about serene? Try growing up on a huge farm. Now that's serene
3190,"My family owns a farm, and I love working the land, tending the animals. Pull on my leather boots, and I am ready to work"
3190,"It was nice, but, I moved to the big city a couple of years ago. What kind of crops do they grow?"
3190,"Well right now, we have some cotton, and just transitioned to wintery crops, like broccoli and other leafy veggies. I live in the city, but visit the farm every weekend"
3190,"We grow cotton too. I live in the south, so when it was ready to harvest, I always pretended it was snow. "
3190,I am also in the south! Its the only snow we get that doesn't melt before it hits the ground. Wish it snowed more
3190,LOL~ Yes! I know. It snowed here a couple of years ago and it was gone by noon. So disappointing. 
3190,Yeah. Unfornately my state has weather that changes at the drop of a hat. What else do you do in your free time?
3190,Mine too! I like to cook and read. You?
3190,"I listen to heavy metal, work out and leathercraft and work with wood. I also can veggies and preserves"
3191,lol Yeah yeah.  I can't help it.  I really love Thai food. What about you?
3191,Curry is my favorite! I love that coconut milk imparts such a great flavor to Thai food.
3191,hmmm sound  nice. So what do you do for a living ?
3191,I work as a sales associate for a large department store. It's a pretty great job. How about you?
3191,  As of now I work as a lifeguard at a local YMCA.  
3192,"my friends are the best, i get to see them often cause i usually work from home"
3192,That's awesome. Sounds like you have a great set of friends. What kind of stuff do you to together?
3192,we enjoy watching movies together and going to Nightwish concerts
3192,that sounds like fun . my friends and i love to go to the movies . We go shopping a lot to.
3192,where are your favorite places to go shopping?
3192,i like mom and pop type places rather than large ones . you ?
3192,"i enjoy going to target for my shopping needs, they usually have cute clothing items and shoes"
3192,I've always liked Target's quality. They are usually our first stop on Black Friday. They have the best deals.
3192,"I love going to target on black friday to purchase a new pokemon game, it has become my own tradition"
3192,I love Pokemon.
3192,"Pokemon is the absolute best, i grew up watching it and playing the games"
3192,I was a total pokemon nerd lol
3193,"Yea, I don't know how anyone could think there is a need, especially if they have graduated from college."
3193,You are totally right. What do you do for a living? 
3193,"I just finished college so I am starting a small buisness selling locally made products, I have 8 others selling under my store front right now."
3193,That sounds great. I am looking for a job right now. Are you hiring?
3193,I could use another cashier/inventory person. The people who sell their products are to busy making them to work in the store itself. 
3193,That sound like a plan. Do I need to have any experience? Do you like junk food? I do
3193,"Just come on by and we'll do an interview. I like junk food, but I try to eat healthy."
3193,"Great, how fast do you think I will be ale to start working?"
3193,"With in a week, may I ask what your last job was?"
3193,I answered phones for a call center so I have a lot of customer service experience. 
3193,That's awesome. Hope to see you soon for that interview!
3193,Great what time do you guys open?
3194,"Oh, passenger trains are interesting, but I prefer studying freight trains."
3194,It's cool how the vehicles run on tracks instead of a flat surface
3194,Yes. I was very interested in making train track configurations when I was young.
3194,It's so much different than cars because you're being guided by the tracks instead of on a prepared flat surface
3194,"Yes, exactly.  Have you ever seen Thomas the Train?"
3194,"I have, my son loves the show."
3194,I think that was what really caught my interest originally!
3194,That's really awesome! Do you study trains as a career?
3194,"No, I just study them as a hobby currently."
3194,That's cool! It's always good to have a hobby
3194,"Yes, do you have any hobbies?"
3194,"Mainly Youtube, I do some freelance work on it occasionally, and Reddit. Lots of Reddit."
3194,Awesome!  I also spend a lot of time on Reddit.
3195,I think I saw x game the other day.
3195,Is that a pro game?
3195,They have pro and amateur versions.
3195,"Ah.  That's cool.  I don't work, so I watch a lot of TV, but I've never watched X games."
3195,I watch x games with friends. It makes us all smile.
3195,That's good to have something you all have in common.
3195,Yeah it brings us together. What do you do with friends?
3195,"We like to get together at a local cafe and chat.  Sometimes we go see a movie, or go to poetry readings."
3195,That seems nice. I'd like to do that sometime.
3195,It's really interesting and intellectually stimulating to hear other people's creativity.
3195,I personally really like getting my friends to smile and let go of their life problems.
3195,That's a great attitude.  You should try poetry.  It's a good form of expression.
3196,"Well red is a popular color. I like black because it resonates with my spirit. I am a ghost hunter of sorts,"
3196,"i've never met a ghost , so i am not sure"
3196,I have seen many before and they aren't all bad spirits.
3196,so you believe in ghost?
3196,"Of course, spirits are everywhere. You probably have a few surrounding you."
3197,"I suppose, but I generally like to assume that people have good intentions. "
3197,I like to assume people are good as well; but it is better to be safe than sorry!
3198,That sounds great. Do you work nights a lot?
3198,"That's my normal shift in fact, so it's all I do."
3198,"Hmm, that sounds like it might be rough. I like staying up to watch the stars, but I'm not sure I'd want to be working while I do it."
3198,"It is stressful, but once you get used to the sleep schedule shift it's like normal work, except with a calm peaceful environment."
3198,"You make it sound nice. I wish I had a job that would let me do that. So you like the railroad, then?"
3198,I do.  I can't go without the open road.  I do miss seeing my family often. It's tough but also pays well.
3198,"Oh, so you travel a lot. What's the most interesting place you've visited?"
3198,"My favorite would be Arizona with the grand canyon. But honestly, just being able to see something new each time is enough."
3198,"That sounds fun. A train probably beat traveling by car, too. I've never been on a long train trip."
3198,"Imagine the benefits of the sites and experiences of travel, without worrying about traffic or driving tired or cramped seats."
3198,"No more traffic jams. I'm sold. I wish traveling by train wasn't so expensive, though. Flying is ususally cheaper."
3198,"That's true, travel by train isn't gonna be as good as airplane travel. Unless you get a job doing it. Then they pay you."
3199,"Yeah, she was in a lot of pain, and we ended up letting her go peacefully. My daughter just now, after 3 years is ready for another pet"
3199,That is so sad. Any ideas on what kind of pet?
3199,She wants to get a couple bunnies to raise for our local rodeo and fair for her FFA club in school. 
3199,"Oh, how adorable! There are so many bunnies around right now.  My parents house has especially a lot of them and they don't really run off like normal either."
3199,"I set up a little bunny pen outside so they can have free range and my wife will drive down and pick them up today, since I cannot drive"
3199,that sounds awesome. I enjoy collected antique knives personally. Do you collect?
3199,I collect old coins and United states currency. I recently sold my oldest son (who's 24) old Pokemon collection
3199,My son really liked Pokemon too! He liked playing the card game and watching the show.
3199,"My son liked the games, and never learned to play, but had a book full of them-over 1500 of them. He liked the art"
3199,It's great when kids can find something like that to get in to. 
3199,"Yeah, my son went to competively swim for over 12 years- all through high school and college. "
3199,That is amazing hard work pays off and I think it is great that our kids know how to swim.
3200,"Yes, they do. I actually had a dream about butterflies last night. I wonder why.."
3200,You would never guess but Butterflies date back 56 million years ago. How did they manage to live with the Dinosaurs?
3200,"Butterflies are such gentle creatures, so I'm sure they were able to coexist really well with Dinosaurs."
3200,Did the dream feel like it was really happening? Strange indeed.
3200,"It felt so real, it was one of the most vivid dreams I've had lately. Have you ever had a dream like that?"
3201,Which fries are better in your opinion and where from?
3201,Canada. They were brought to the US and the UK where they are very popular. The seasoned variety are to die for!
3201,That sounds great! I would like to explore Canada more. I have only been to Montreal
3201,Cheers from across the pond! It truly is a magical place. I just wish I wasn't so addicted to fries. I eat too many. lol
3201,"I understand that. I hate it when they get cold, that is for sure. However a good ol dish of fish and chips is a good dish"
3201,Agreed! I'm actually eating some now. Just spilled tartar sauce on my new sweater. haha
3201,Oh! No good. I wish I had that for lunch.
3201,I wish you did too! I'll eat some in your honor.
3201,Thanks so much. I appreciate that. What else do you have planned for the rest of your day?
3201,Getting ready to go out and get some more fries to have with dinner ! And you ?
3201,I am working. Oh well maybe I'll have some fries later on.
3201,"That sounds like a fine idea. Have you heard of the bk chicken fries? I haven't tried them yet, but hear good things."
3202,Sweet. You will get there. I enjoy being moved out. 
3202,it's not bad or anything like i have rules just to be respectful. got to out from under school loans
3203,What is your favorite music to listen to? 
3203,My favorite music is country.  What's yours?
3203,"I like classic rock, mainly 70's and 80's. I play a lot that in my high school band. Do you like movies?"
3203,"I do like movies, but I haven't been able to make it to a theater in quite awhile."
3203,do you like watching movies at home more than the going to the theater?
3203,"I like the theater experience, but all the at home streaming options are so convenient these days.  What about you?"
3203,I really do not like crowds so I prefer to watch movies at home.
3203,"Same.  I prefer having people over to barbecue, etc, at my own house."
3203,"Yeah of course. I like being around people I know, but do not care too much for strangers"
3203,I feel the same.  Do you have any other hobbies?
3203,I also like to collect stamps for my personal collection 
3203,"Oh, cool.  I've never spent too much time looking at stamps."
3204,Yes I think my pet iguanas help my memory
3204,That's awesome! How do they help? Sometimes I think that my memory is not always accurate. I have strange childhood memories that may not have actually happened.
3204,"Oh wow, thats interesting. Dogs could also learn to read if we trained them good enough"
3204,"Lol, if only we can understand dogs and listen to what they are saying. That would be hilarious."
3204,"Haha I know right, do you have pets?"
3204,I have 3. What about you? Anything besides the Iguanas? 
3204,No just 3 iguanas that are awesome
3204,What are their names? 
3204,"Jack, Spike, and peanut lol"
3204,Are they green iguanas?
3204,yes they are ! I've had them for 5 years
3204,Cool! What do they eat? 
3205,yes pizza and you
3205,This might really weird but I love  raw onion.  So give me any meal with raw onions and you have a happy person! lol  Is that bad?
3205,"no it isn't bad, I love raw onions on toast"
3205,yay I have a raw onion buddy lol.  So what do you do for fun?
3205,"watch sports and fish, do you like to fish?"
3205,"I can't say that I have, but I'm willing to give it  a try.  I don't get get out much."
3205,I used to get out a lot but with bad knees I am limited.
3205,Yeah I can understand that.  So do you have any family?
3205,Yes I am married with a young son. Do you have any family?
3205,"Nope just me and my mom, who people say we look just alike because we both have long curly hair."
3205,"Curly hair nice, my hair is quite wavy especially when I go swimming."
3205,I use to love swimming as a kid. I need to do that again.
3206,"Yes I'll still be needed at my company, just not for the job I'm doing right now. "
3206,I'm sorry to hear that. That is very stressful and upsetting  I hope you will find peace.
3206,Yes. I hope I find peace. One way I do that though is by praying. 
3206,"I find peace by going on hikes and enjoying the color changing leaves in the fall, sespecially the red ones."
3206,"That's awesome. I love nature a lot, and it's awesome to see the world always around you. "
3206,"Yes, and the changing of the leaves is wonderful."
3206,Yes that is very true. Fall is very nice. 
3206,"Yes , although it feels like summer today fall will definitely be here fast ."
3206,Yes. The weather is incredibly hot. Climate change has really started happening. 
3206,How are you faring in todays climate?
3206,Not that great. It's very irregular and the weather does not follow the forecast. You can't be sure if it will even rain or not. 
3206,"I'm hoping for there to be some rain, it's been so dry."
3206,"The same for me, I'll like to feel refreshed. "
3207,Yeah. I really love being a member of the YMCA. I work out all the time. How about you?
3207,I do too!   I like that they have so many community based programs
3207,They totally do. What are you up to today? I have to go get a hair cut. I like to keep my hair very short. 
3207,i work at a diner later
3207,That's cool. I love going to diners. I enjoy a hot cup of coffee.
3207,"I love coffee, actually. I drink a few cups every morning!"
3207,Me too. It's the best part of waking up! 
3207,"it really is, i also own a cupcake business so i need the coffee to keep me going all day"
3207,That's exciting. I bet it's hard not to just eat cupcakes all day long.
3207,"it's very hard, but a little self control goes a long way"
3207,That's true. Will power is definitely something you need around all those baked good!
3207,I wish I could make a cheescake.
3208,Interesting. I didn't know that. My girlfriend and I eat pancakes almost every morning.
3208,Damn! Yeah I make pancakes for my boyfriend often! Sometimes waffles too. 
3208,Waffles are a good idea. We don't have those too often. How do you make them?
3208,"Waffle maker is what i use. I buy this HUGE box of pancake mix, it has waffle instructions on it I follow. "
3208,Do you use maple syrup with those as well?
3208,Always.
3208,My girlfriend prefers the low fat syrup.
3208,I bet it healthier!
3208,I would think so although it doesn't taste quite as good.
3208,I was just going to ask how it tasted. That's unfortunate 
3208,Its not ideal but when you eat pancakes as often as we do I suppose it helps.
3208,"That is a very good point! So at the end of the day, it all works out. "
3209,"I sure hope so, but I certainly get nervous.  Do you have plans for the weekend?"
3209,"Nothing big. I'm going to watch basketball this weekend, as much as I can between chores."
3209,I like watching Netflix.  Do you watch anything on Netflix?
3209,"Nah, not lately. I'm obsessed with watching basketball these days."
3209,College or pro>
3209,"NBA mostly,."
3209,Do you have a favorite team?
3209,NBA mostly. I'm for the Pistons.
3209,My nephew loves basketball - he seems to like Golden State
3209,Cool. Any good new series on Netflix these days?
3209,"I have to admit, I haven't watched lately -life has been a little crazy, but I watch Orange Is the New Black "
3209,A lot of my friends are into that. I keep meaning to try.
3210,In my 53 years of being alive I've had it happen a handful of times and it irritates me.
3210,You think people would be more considerate of other people's time. Did you find another guitar?
3210,"I eventually found another buyer. I'm from Alabama, and the guy that bought it was a guitar player for 3 Doors Down."
3210,wow! nice he was so close after the last time.  Is it warm today in Alabama?
3210,"It's mild, it's in the 70s here which is perfect for me."
3210,It is a bit cooler here in Michigan.  Waiting for the snow!
3210,Keep that up there. Lol I hate snow. I lived in South Dakota for a few years and I was miserable.
3210,I am not a fan of snow either.  Would love to move down south. 
3210,I love it. I've moved further and further south with each move. Eventually I'll move to Key West.
3210,Then you have to worry about hurricanes!  I am not sure I want to move that far south- LOL
3210,"I live along the Gulf now and we get hurricanes. It's just something you have to deal with, but it's such a beautiful place."
3210,Sounds nice!  One of these days I will escape the cold and snow!
3211,Oh really? Which colour is your cat?
3211,My cat is black with some white spots on its feet
3211,Which colour is the spots?
3211,The spots are white. Do you have more than one cat?
3211,"I have a white cat, he is really cute"
3211,"That's awesome! My cat is still in the kitten stage, so she is very crazy. How old is your cat?"
3211,My cat is 5 years old and he actually saved me from one day when I was in a store that was being robbed.
3212,"Yeah, I hid under my princess bed for shelter, and waited for the storm and tornado warnings to stop"
3212,I don't live in an area that is known for tornadoes but they still scare me. I'm glad you're ok!
3212,"Usually we get hurricanes more, but tornados are much faster. Do you have any crazy weather in your area?"
3212,"I live in houston currently, so about two years ago we were hit by Hurricane Harvey, it was scar"
3212,I recently moved from Houston to Dallas. I miss Houston. I moved right after flooding out due to Harvey. 
3212,"Houston is fantastic, did you have to move due to the flooding?"
3212,"Yes, the house was ruined, and luckily we had flood insurance. We ended up relocating also for my mom's job"
3212,"That's good! I know insurance can be a pain to deal with! I am glad you are safe, and i am sorry for your house"
3212,"I am happy where we are. When I come home from college, my daddy gives me flowers to take back to school. I make it work"
3212,"awh that is too sweet, i miss getting to see my dad every day, but i too am in college now"
3212,what are you studying?
3212,"i am currently studying veterinary science, i hope to be a vet one day, i have a dog and wanna give back to other animals"
3213,"Yes, it was.  Were you ever in a spelling bee?"
3213,No I was a horrible at spelling. I am in college now and technology has come a long way so I make sure to use spell checker.
3213,I have let my spelling skills slide because of spell check.  
3213,I am going into education and spelling now isn't a big of a deal like it once was. 
3213,That is true.  There are other things to focus on now that technology has improved so much.  WHat do you teach?
3213,I am getting a degree in general education so K-12
3213,Sounds good.  Working with kids is not my specialty.  I love to cook
3213,What is your favorite meal to cook? I don't have that talent either
3213,"I like to cook big elaborate meals.  You would think I would be tired of it after cooking them all day long, but no."
3213,That seems like a lot of work. I could not stay focused and I would burn the food.
3213,Cooking is relaxing to me.  It just all falls into place as I go.  
3213,I enjoy relaxing activities as well. We all have our own pleasantries.
3214,"They are doing about as well as can be expected, i think i'll have her come ride my horse named beauty to help her cope with it"
3214,That's fantastic. I wish I had a horse for my daughter.
3214,i got her when my husband went off to war to help keep me from being so lonely
3214,I'm sure that helped quite a bit.
3214,"it did, how's your day going?"
3214,Quite well actually. Just spending some time relaxing today.
3214,"nice, relaxing days are the best days"
3214,They are few and far between these days but I do enjoy my time alone.
3214,with the way the world is these days it is hard to relax
3214,No kidding. Things certainly are stressful these days. I try not to think about it. My dogs help keep me sane.
3214,dogs are amazing like that
3214,They are! They are always there for your no matter what.
3215,"I love her books, she's one of the ones I've read several times."
3215,She's a great author. I really love the Harry Potter series. My mother is a teacher and she reads it to her students in school.
3215,That's awesome. Is your mom one of those teachers who share on blogs? I've found such great ones out there.
3215,"She's not too internet savvy so she doesn't keep a blog, but I sure do love to read blogs. It's great to pass the time. "
3215,Right? Typically a bit better then the stuff you'd normally find out there. 
3215,That's true. I really like blogs about biking. I really like to bike everywhere. It's much better than driving in my opinion.
3215,"I live really far out of town to bike like that, but I do some for fun."
3215,"That's too bad. Yeah, biking is really great exercise and so much fun. "
3215,True. Who is your favorite author
3215,I really like JK Rowling. I'm currently reading the entire Harry Potter series again for the 100th time!
3215,"Yea, she may be my favorite too. What else do you do for fun."
3215,"Other then biking, I really like to hike in the mountains. What about you?"
3216,I enjoy running in marathons. Also my father owns an appliance store that I don't want to inherit...
3216,I hope we can go a marathon together in the future. Why don't you want to inherit the appliance store by the way?
3216,"It has a lot of issues with the place, some my own father didint want to take care of. "
3216,Can you name some of the issues the place had?'
3216,Roof leaks. Broken bay door. Broken glass front doors(boarded up with wood).
3216,Wow. That's a lot of problems to have. I can see why you don't want to inherit it.
3216,"Exactly, but its okay. He understands, just wanted to offer just in case."
3216,"I hope he takes care of the issues though, the place might turn into a great place in future, you never know. "
3216,Thats a great thought! 
3216,Yes it is. Just like the ugly duckling story.
3216,"Yeah, just like it. "
3216,Yep. :))
3217,It really annoys me because I'm unemployed and need peace to find a job!
3217,I bet that can be nerve wracking! I live on a farm so it's always peaceful.
3217,Do you have many farm animals?
3217,Yes we have a lot of cattle and chickens. We usually sell them for the meat. 
3217,Freshly slaughtered meat has to be extra tasty.
3217,It really is good meat. We hunt a lot too. Mostly for deer in the winter.
3217,"A few years ago, I had a deer burger. It was really good. "
3217,The meat taste a little gamish but if you cook the meat properly then you shouldn't have an issue.
3217,"It was told the best way to cook it is in the oven, to avoid it being too dry. "
3217,Right and you want the meat to stay juicy and tender. 
3217,"Of course, I don't mind the gamey flavor at all. "
3217,I enjoy deer salami the most because it delicious on crackers. I am glad you enjoyed that deer burger.
3218,she forgot it in her locker and then never went back to get it

3218,"Oh that's cool! I'm a percussionist, but I've been out of practice forever"
3218,i was never very good at percussion but ive always admired it. I find it hard to keep a steady rythm
3218,I get that; I've been drumming on everything since I was a little kid
3219,It is really important in boxing to learn proper technique.  Having a good trainer is essential.  What do you like to do in your spare time?
3219,im in college so i study most of the time
3219,Studying is important in college.  Hopefully you have a little downtime to relax
3219,yeah i do but i also work to pay for college. i like to workout and play guitar

3219,what is your major in college?
3219,i study aviation
3219,"wow, sounds interesting"

3220,ok .where are you from
3220,I'm from South Carolina. What about you?
3220,ontario from canada
3220,"Oh, yeah? That sounds cold. I bet the leaves are spectaculur there, though. They've barely started changing here."
3220,what do you know about canada
3220,"Not too much. We hear about the occasional political flare up here, and we talk about your health care system a lot."
3220,do you know area 51
3220,"Well, I know about it. I've never been to Roswell. The rush Area 51 thing that was going on for a little while sounded interesting."
3220,how to become a scientist in area 51
3220,"Oh, Area 51 is a military base. You'd have to start by joining the Air Force."
3220,what is your professional job kindly tell me
3220,"I got a job last week with McDonald's. Not exciting, but it's work. How about you?"
3221,"I've heard that too, but that seems like a different type of scary."
3221,Maybe just find some relaxation techniques. Or think about baseball...
3221,Deep breaths and having a water tend to help. Man just talking about this is making me nervous.
3221,I feel the same way about public speaking. The night before just pamper yourself and relax. Running at night helps me wind down.
3221,"True. I don't run a lot, only got one pair of shoes!"
3221,I enjoy lifting weights too. Gets out the nervous energy.
3221,Do you like shoes? My mom is obsessed with them.
3221,I love shoes! I have over a hundred pairs.
3221,"My mom is worse, she has 500! I don't know how she has room for anything else. "
3221,I'd have more if I could afford them. What do you do for fun?
3221,"I read and play video games, always a good time."

3222,"I am a pharmacist, so I work with all kinds of medicine. Currently at school researching other solutions for diabetes"
3222,That's very cool.  I worked in a pharmacy as a pharmacy tech when I was in college.  I really enjoyed that.
3222,That's aweome! What did you end up doing after college?
3222,"Surprisingly enough, I went into banking for a few years"
3222,"Wow, big change (no pun intended) do you enjoy your job?"
3222,"I wasn't too crazy about it, so I only stayed in that for about 3 years. It was a good experience though."
3222,"Ah, well when I am not researching, I am taking care of my three kids"
3222,WOW...that has to be a full time job.  How old are your kiddos?
3222,"14, 10, and 7 "
3222,Great ages.  Do they play sports?
3222,"My 14yo runs track, my 10yo swims and my 7yo likes gymnastics. They all love different things haha"

3223,"I liked Zelda, plus a lot of classic Nintendo stuff."
3223,Oh man that's one of my favorite games right there.  Do you ever find time to get back into gaming or are those days over?
3223,"Mostly over.  I've considered getting back into it a few times, but think it may take up too much time."
3223,Yeah I can understand that. Well it was nice talking with you.
3224,"Wow, that's crazy! Are you a bieber fan?"
3224,Yes I am! Are you a big fan of any artists?

3224,What kind of music do you like to play?
3224,"I mainly play acoustic, easy listening type music. What about you?"
3224,That's interesting! I mostly play jazz on the saxophone and acoustic rock on everything else.
3224,"Oh nice, you must be very talented! Do you just play for fun?"
3224,Thank you! I used to play in a marching band but now I just play for fun. Have you ever played in any bands?

3225,"That's great! I really like my job, it is tough at times."
3225,probably really rewarding too
3225,"Yeah, at the end of the day and can feel like I helped at least one person to make it feel worthwhile."
3225,thats great! i wish i had a job like that
3226,For sure! I love my parents so much. They helped me my whole life

3226,I'm not a fan of sports but I workout three times a week it helps me destress.
3226,That's good to hear. I starting making my own lunch to try and eat healthier 
3226,What are you making for lunch today?
3226,I made salads and a chicken sandwich. Also only trying to drink water
3226,I drink about 50 ounces of water a day. I mean I try to.
3226,Nice. I think we should all stop drinking soda and such
3226,I can't lie... I love a good cherry vanilla coke every once in awhile. I find it funny that people don't drink soda for health reasons but still drink alcohol.
3227,"she is currently staying with me at my house, it has been fairly lonely since my husband passed"
3227,i hope she's okay . i will pray for her . very sad
3227,"it is sad, but i am going to help her rebuild a new home that is perfect for her and her kids"

3227,"she is, but more importantly i am proud of her for standing strong during such a tough time"
3227,"Well, she's very lucky to have you during this tough time for her.  Do you have other siblings? "
3227,"I have an older brother, he lives further away but is coming down for a visit soon"
3227,Are you guys really close? I have a brother and we fight about everything. He'll even fight me because my favorite color is green and he hates green!
3227,"We get along okay, we used to have fights all the time, but now that we have some distance, things are better"
3227,that is great . I think space would be best for us as well.  Maybe one day!

3228,I got it online from ....i forget!
3228,I gotcha. I bought mine online too.
3228,"it wasn't expensive, though"
3228,The price really depends on the locale based on the population culture and geographic conditions.
3228,that sounds scientific...are you a scientist?
3228,"No, went to college for communications."
3228,gotcha
3228,What did you go to school for?
3228,I didn't
3229,Attachment theory--isn't that where the kid breastfeeds indefinitely and sleeps in your bed? Is that good or not?
3229,No. It's rather when human beings find a way to bond with each other over a period of time. 
3229,Seems like the parent-child bond is there from the beginning. But I am too busy having my fun to be a parent.
3229,Oh ok. In what ways are you having fun?
3229,I like going to the lake on weekends and paddling around in a kayak. I like hiking. What about you?
3229,"I love reading books, playing video games and taking a walk around. "
3229,Nice. Are you an introvert or an extrovert? 
3229,"I'm mainly an introvert, but once I get to know you I become rather extroverted. "
3229,"Same. I was born into a military family and attended like 16 schools, so I can fake it, but really strong introvert tendencies."
3229,Oh. That is cool. 
3229,"Yes, unsettling to a kid to have to move so much, but it made me adaptable. Have you lived in the same place ll your life?"
3229,No. I've moved about 4 times in my life. It's really sad when you move. 
3230,The Knicks vs Nets game tonight!
3230,Oh that's really cool! Who are  you rooting for?

3230,"Depends! I love college football, but not much else"
3230,"Oh, that's cool! What is your favorite college football team?"
3230,LSU Tigers! Always been a huge Tigers fan
3230,Aw that's awesome! I know a couple of die hard LSU fans. I live in Texas and have always wanted to go to the Oklahoma vs Texas college football game.
3230,Oh I'm sure that'd be wild!
3230,Yup! Their games always look so intense. They have such a huge rivalry against each other.
3230,Right; the Red River Rivalry or something like that right?
3230,Yes. Have you ever been to any of the LSU games?
3230,"Yeah! I go every now and then, The LSU-Bama game is always intense, save for them blowing us out"
3231,I lived in a small town for most of my life. We had fried chicken and chocolate cake every Sunday. My favorites!
3231,"Yeah, living in a small town can be hard, but we living on a pig farm and I really loved working with the pigs. I really love chocolate cake too!"
3231,"I think living in a small town is why I trust people enough to leave my car unlocked. Now that I'm in the city, maybe I should re-think that?"
3231,I guess it depends on what city you live in. Must be nice living in the city. I really wish I lived in a city.
3231,"The shopping is nice, but I don't like the traffic. I also miss all my older siblings back home."
3231,I totally understand. Traffic is always the worst. I don't have any siblings. How many do you have?
3231,I'm the youngest out of 4 of us. I have two older brothers and one sister who is a year older than me.
3231,Whoa that's awesome. I always wished I had some siblings to grow up with.
3231,"It was fun when we went outside to play, we had an even number for teams! "
3231,So cool. I bet you were pretty good. I've never played on a team before. 
3231,We didn't play anything really competitive. Just playing in the dirt! We had fun though.
3231,Yeah. I'm not very competitive. Playing in the dirt sure does sound fun though!
3232,YOU: I have lived in a dense sheltered life! I'm about to leave for college to attend very liberal school soon...you?
3232,already in college :)
3232,lucky you! how is it>
3232,alot of work but not too bad
3232,"Good to hear, what are you going for?"
3232,Animal science and you?
3232,Law school
3232,"Ah, that's cool. I heard law school is super competitive."
3232,yeah it is! Animal science sounds really interesting 
3232,"It seems it overlaps wiht a lot of topics though, like biochemistry, ecology, and even paleontology."
3232,Yeah I bet! 
3232,"It is really different from the field of paleontology, which is the study of fossil remains, but people still get confused between the two!"
3233,"I love Good Eats and Unwrapped. Love cooking, its on all the time in my house"
3233,Do you find that watching it makes you want to cook more?
3233,"Yes, I find I like to cook at home more, which ultimately saves my family money. "
3233,I like to cook at home as well. We have people over a lot. Cooking for people is something that I do to make them smile.
3233,"Food and memories make people happy. I would have people over more, but I have three dogs and two cats in the way"
3233,That's a lot of activity. I'm allergic to cats so I can't have them.
3233,"Yeah, my wife likes to work with the animal shelter here in Dallas and wants to save them all it seems"
3233,Doing something you're passionate about seems to be the secret to life. Glad she has that.
3233,"I completely support her wants, I just wish I had more say in what I would like animal wise "
3233,What type of animal do you want?
3233,I would like to maintain a tropical fish aquarium
3233,"That seems like something she would be okay with, right?"
3233,She doesn't want the water risk damaging the house or having to redo the plumbing to support it
3234,That does sound wonderful! I love to cook. What kinds of things do you make?
3234,"My family loves when I make lamb, chicken, or seafood with rice dishes."
3234,That sounds delicious! Do you have any other hobbies?
3234,I play the piano.  What about you?
3234,That's cool! I play the saxophone. What type of music do you play?
3234,"A little classical, but these days I mostly play show tunes I'm already familiar with."
3234,That's cool! I love show tunes. Do you like to watch musicals?
3234,"I do! I watched a lot with my mom when I was young, just starting to pick up the interest again."
3234,Fun! Have you been to any live musicals?
3234,A few.  My mom immigrated to this country and loved music to help learn English.
3234,That's pretty interesting. I'd never thought of music as a language learning tool!
3234,I think it worked for her because it was already something she was super passionate about.
3235,For sure. They share brands they like and are sponsored by. That's a great example.
3235,"Yea, they really do a lot. I'm working on my own youtube channel."
3235,Oh that is exciting. What kind of content do you put on there?
3235,Make up! Might do other stuff later as well.
3235,Nice! I'll have to take a look at it. Right now it takes me about an hour to get ready in the morning. I'd like to streamline some of that.
3235,Luckily you do not have to be a registered user to get involved.
3235,What are you talking about?
3235,I'm saying you don't have to be subscribed to my youtube to watch.
3235,"Oh! Yes, I got you know. I'll definitely check it out. "
3235,there are so many good channels on youtube . do you like it ?
3235,I do! I sometimes lose track of time on youtube. What is your favorite channel?
3235,Makeup or Fake It.
3235,I'll have to check that out. thanks
3236,My best friend threw me a little party.
3236,"Sweet, those are the best. I usually just hang out with family. "
3236,My family is always working and tired.  I am 35 so I don't expect them to throw one for me anymore.
3236,"True, I really like parties though. I love drinking and getting drunk"
3236,I used too but am getting to old for that.  I am lucky to get a couple drinks down these days.
3236,Right. I am trying to slow down. I think I should go for walks more often too
3236,How old are you?  I should walk too but do not have the motivation yet.
3236,26. I should start now to get a good habit going. 
3236,Yeah it is a good habit to walk every day.  Did you know that 10000 steps is what the Heart Association recommends to stay healthy?
3236,Interesting! Facts are so cool. I think I will google some facts now
3236,Yeah I guess so. LOL.
3236,I'm looking now. They also say to walk at least 3 times a week
3237,yes i wish
3237,My older self was too willing to give up school in order to get married. I wish I could change that.
3237,"sometimes that happen , this is the life "
3237,So what are you doing today? I want to go shopping later and just relax.
3237,"today i'm free , after that i meet some friends to hang out . "
3237,I want to have a good dinner somewhere. Do you like to eat steak?
3237,yeah i like 
3237,I love mushrooms with my steak. What is your favorite thing to eat?
3237,"chicken , steak , everything hahaha "
3237,Do you like chicken fajitas? My boyfriend doesn't eat mexican food so I never get to eat them anymore.
3237,"i didn't try this "" fajitas"" before . "
3237,"They are delicious. I want to go swimming this afternoon, I hope it doesn't rain."
3238,It was just a little bit insane...they were just so fidgety and bickered so much!
3238,Yeah I hear that.  So what do you do for a living?
3238,I'm currently a student working on my master's degree.  How about you?
3238,I just started a graphic designer job at a game studio that make 70k not that bad. 
3238,WOW...that's fantastic.  I'm going to need a job that pays that well to pay off my student loans
3238,That's the 1st thing I'm doing lol. 
3238,I'm sure it will be the first and last things I do...the good news is that I like going to museums in my free time
3238,Now that's a place I haven't been to in a while.  What was the last museum you been too?
3239,"Lately, I like to relax at the casino."
3239,That's cool. Gambling can be risky. I really like to go swimming at the Y. I go every day. Do you like to swim?
3239,"I like to swim every now and then. Yeah, I think I may spend just a bit too much at casinos."
3239,"Better be careful. I know gambling can be addictive. I really like to collect stamps, it's pretty dorky, but fun."
3239,An hobby that you enjoy is good. It is nice to have something to focus your attention on.
3239,"Definitely. Stamp collecting can get pretty expensive though, so I have to watch out."
3239,"Yeah, most hobbies are. Unlike gambling, at least you are sure to get something for your money."
3239,"You're right. Gambling is risky for sure. Stamps, not so much."
3239,"I could use a stable hobby, so far it is just casinos and hanging out with my buddies."
3239,That's cool. What else do you like to do when you hang out with your buddies?
3239,"We play some video games, chat, play a bit of pool. Still playing in my old age."
3239,You're never too old to play. I really enjoy just hanging out with friends too. 
3240,Have you been to Broadway? I love it
3240,"I went to see Hamiliton in my spare time, I am usually really busy"
3240,Cool. Do you like football?
3240,"Actually, yes, I am an athlete and play offensive line and love to tackle"
3240,Oh cool!! What NFL team do you like?
3240,"I am more of an Eagles fan, but te Seahawks are okay, I like what Pete Carroll has done with the team"
3240,"Yeah, definitely. I'm a big Steelers fan"
3240,Have you gone to any games?
3240,"Yes, I went to one recently. Their season is not great though"
3240,"Well, I go and enjoy the atmosphere more than the game itself most of the time when I go to games"
3240,"Yes I agree, which games do you go to?"
3240,"Well, I usually end up going to loacl college games or the Texans games"
3241,42 is the answer to the universe you know
3241,"Really? That's interesting, I didn't know that? Are you very into space? "
3241,"Somewhat, mostly just a casual interest"
3241,What is your thoughts on dark matter?
3241,I think it's a fascinating theory! 
3241,"No one has seen dark matter, right? but it has to exists since it can be inferred from gravitational calculations."
3241,Exactly. Theoretically dark matter exists based on those calculations
3241,Sometimes getting too deep into physics makes my head spin! I start questioning everything. What do you do for fun?
3241,Oh yeah for sure! I like to play ultimate frisbee for fun!
3241,Nice! that's a great way to stay active. Sometime I go to casinos on the weekends for fun.
3241,Haha that sounds fun! I couldn't do that! I can't afford to lose a dime right now
3241,I totally get that! I usually set a small budget
3242,"You know, a rollercoaster built back then was probably much more dangerous that today's, which are built with such precision."
3242,"Yes, and they keep finding new ways to create adrenaline! Makes you wonder what they will come up with next."
3242,"Yes! You know, I am training to be a welder, and one day I would love to design and build my own coasters."
3242,That would be amazing! What kind of roller coaster do you think you'd design? Would it go upside down?
3242,"Oh yes! Upside down, loops, everything! But safety would be my priority. I'd want people to be scared but not be in danger."
3242,Yes I agree with that! Have you seen those ones that have the seats designed so your legs hang down?
3242,Yes. That really increases the feeling of being exposed. Have you ever ridden one?
3242,"No but I'd like to, I don't think I've been on a roller coaster since high school and I know they've changed a ton since then."
3242,Yes. Do you remember your first roller coaster ride? How old were you?
3242,Yeah I think I was around 14 or 15. How about you?
3242,"I was 13. It was a small coaster at a fair, and it nearly jerked my head off because it had such sharp turns. I loved it though!"
3242,Yep those are the best ones and the ones that go upside down.
3243,"I am a mother like you, but I am working on my Masters online under NHU as it meets my schedule demands."
3243,"That's really exciting, what are you mastering in? Had I done school in Ghana it would have only been 6 years."
3243,"My masters is in English Literature, emphasizing on teaching English teachers to teach. I will be able to teach at the University level. Tell me about Ghana. "
3243,"Ghana was great, but I'm glad to be home."
3243,"That ls good! You should really look into some online programs, a few places online have a really good reputation"
3243,"Ghana was great, but I'm glad to be home."
3243,"Phonenix Univ has a good online program, also some local schools closer to home are boadening to representation online"
3243,A masters degree sounds very demanding.
3243,"Not at much as one would think, you can work on school at your own pace. This is great since I have young children!"
3243,I need to look into it more. 
3243,"I would encourage you to do so. If I can be of any help, just let me know!"
3243,I will let you know what I find out. What do you like to cook?
3244,No. But I plan to be one. I'm going to culinary school soon. 
3244,Do you enjoy cooking for others or for the event you are taking it to?
3244,I enjoy cooking for others. I love it when people enjoy my cooking. 
3244,Great!! Are you like veterinarian food? 
3244,No. i don't like vegetarian food. 
3244,I like very much about the Veg & Sea foods.
3244,"I like sea food also, tastes incredibly awesome. "
3244,How much are you interest in cooking more than your job?
3244,I'll say about 70% more. 
3244,"Good, i am also like cooking, this habit comes from my dad."
3244,Ah. Mine comes from watching cooking videos on Youtube. 
3244,Wow.. Which one is your favorite channel for cooking?
3244,The food channel
3244,What is the favorite dish do you watch? 
3245,I called my co-worker that had the same issue at his house last week
3245,oh no . i just saw a spider . they terrify me .
3245,"Yes, and you know what is worse? We had the same issue in the place that I work in my 1st year."
3245,How big was the spider?
3245,It was huge. How big was the one you had in your house?
3245,42 inches
3245,Oh my God! Did it ever happened with you at work too?
3245,"I don't work, I am a student"

3245,I study chemistry.
3245,And do you have any hobbie?
3245,I like to play baseball!
3245,"I like to listen to music, my favourite is country!"
3246,I like to play around in the yards with the kids since I am a little round and need the exercise
3246,"Thats great you play with your kids.  Mine are in high school, how old are yours?"
3246,They are in elementary school so they have been big into sports. I would rather them focus on academics like me but that will alright.
3246,ok great how are their grades?
3246,They a mediocre but that usually comes with being in grade school and learning to study.
3246,"ah ok mine are straight A students, but I make them study really hard.  Do your kids study hard?"
3246,Yes but they are very active too. Academics come easier for some and some have to really work hard to retain the information.
3246,That's great. Good scores on homework early on can really set someone up for success.  My kids want to be doctors.  how about yours?
3246,I am letting them focus on being kids for the moment. I don't want to apply to much pressure.
3246,"ok cool, but I always try to make learning fun.  Thats why they always watch magic school bus on youtube"
3246,We are just focusing on living. Making the best out of each situation.
3246,that's great . that's a great attitude to have .
3247,"Yes, I did.  It was probably more an instance of puppy love...LOL"
3247,"I totally get ""puppy love"", I had one of those too!  I thought they were the love of my life. HAHA."
3247,"Yes, isn't that funny...now I look back on it, and think 'what in the world was I thinking?'"
3247,Yep.  I agree the person I thought I was so in love with changed so much and I am not even attracted to them at all now.
3248,"Unfortunately, I have really bad luck with relationships and have too much homework to do"
3248,I'm sorry. Do you do any clubs?
3248,I am involved with my honor's college and volunteering program at my college
3248,That's great.  Volunteering is such an altruistic activity.
3248,"Yeah, plus we give back to the impoverished areas, and whatever food isnt eaten at the dining halls we bring to the areas we help"
3248,Nice. Do you want to do charity work after you graduate?
3248,I would like to work with my animal shelters nearby or food banks
3248,That's great. My parents are lawyers so I might want to be a lawyer
3248,"Wow, thats a big aspiration. I would go for that kind of thing, but i can slack off on my homework sometimes"
3248,"That's okay, so do I"
3248,Haha I am glad I am not the only one. What part of law do you like the most?
3248,I like environmental law
3249,"Wow, you know so much about cheese, it's really impressive."
3249,"Yeah, I guess I did a lot of research. I don't like the taste, so I was curious what the process was."
3249,"That's really interesting, you're the only person I've ever met before who didn't like it! Anyway, what are your favorite activities to do?"
3249,Yeah I'm one of the few I've ever met too lol. I like to paint and hike when the weather allows it! How about you?
3249,Awesome! I am a huge outdoors person. I love horseback riding and camping in particular. Do you ever camp after hiking?
3249,Absolutely!! I love to camp any chance i can! Weather has been awful lately so I've been itching to go! 
3249,"Oh yeah, I can relate to that, has it been snowing a lot where you are? My family and I always wait until it's warm to camp."
3249,"No, just rain and hurricanes! But i agree. Warm, not too hot is the best way!"
3249,"Well, at least you can always paint indoors. What are your favorite objects to paint?"
3249,"I will paint on anything I can. Furniture, canvas, walls, people. I enjoy it all!"
3249,"Do you like painting nature scenes, portraits, or indoor objects most? Maybe someday you can paint me on one of my horses."
3249,"I think I prefer scenes most. But I could paint you on the horse, you'd just look like a cartoon!"
3250,Its true. People love to gamble so i think we are seeing more and more of it.
3250,"Yes, i agree.  My family used to own some casinos in Biloxi, but i'm out of the business now."
3250,Oh no. What happened?
3250,"They sold some, but mostly I wanted to move away."
3250,Got it. Was the casino successful?
3250,"They used to be, but there was a lot of commercialization in that area that hurt the businesses."
3250,Interesting. That didn't draw more people to the area?
3250,"Yes, but it was hard to keep up with the newer and fancier chains coming in."
3250,"I see. Well, that's certainly like someone peeing on your roses."
3250,Yes.  The area has definitely changed a lot since I was young.
3251,I try to paint when I'm lonely.  Do you paint?
3251,No I actually sing and crochet. I like to sing in the church choir so I go to church to practice the piano.
3251,oh ok cool.  I also like to travel by boat.  Have you been on a boat?
3251,I have a few times. I would rather ride a boat than fly in a plane. 
3251,cool.  I fish when I'm on the boat.  Do you fish?
3251,I grew up on a farm and enjoy fishing too. I do like to shop.
3251,I like shopping to.  What kinds of store do you visit?
3251,I like to buy Donna Karen clothing which is a high end brand. I just like the fit.
3251,Thats great.  I buy $1.68 shirts at walmart.  Do you shop at walmart?
3251,I do love Walmart. My body has changed since having kids and I prefer to buy name brand because they fit better.
3251,oh ok.  I buy cheap clothes because I'm broke.
3251,I am broke most of the time as well. I just have to save my money. I don't buy stuff for myself often.
3252,"Yes, thank you. How about your experience in flying?"
3252,I don't fly much because I live in the city and it's hard to get to the smaller airports
3252,"Ok, But i have a great experience in my first flight!"
3252,wow exciting ! where did you go ?
3252,I remember it was the trip with my family...
3252,Do you have a big family?
3252,Not a big but my family have 5 members.
3252,Oh that must be a handful for your parents.

3253,"I probably heard his songs before, I just didn't know it was him."
3253,"Yea, most people don't really know him. Do you like to go out to eat?"
3253,I prefer to stay in and cook. 
3253,Why do you prefer that?
3253,I am just not a fan of crowded restaurants. I like to not feel rushed when I eat.
3253,"Ah. That makes perfect sense. I like to eat while chatting with others, that's one reason why I like going out to eat. "
3253,That's cool. What do you like to do for fun? I enjoy swimming.
3253,I like to play video games and read story books.
3253,Me too. I find myself staying in a lot more during the winter. It is my favorite time of year.
3253,"Fall is my favourite time of the year, because it's cool. I feel winter is a bit cold. "
3253,"I like the cold, fall is nice. Summers are too hot around here."
3253,Summer is always super hot. I wish it rained more during summer. 
3254,You're right! I always try to have a positive outlook. What do you do for work?
3254,"One ending means another is begining..I am self employed, I do alot of different things.."
3254,That's true! Do you have a family?
3254,No not yet I dont..Thats one reason I dislike the holidays so much...How about you?
3254,"I'm not married and I don't have any kids, but me and my friends always get together for the holidays so it's not so bad! I love holiday food."
3254,Cool...I do like the food for sure! I may get together with friends if I can get my Ford truck fixed its a POS lol
3254,That would be nice! Enjoying other people's company makes the holidays much better even if you don't have a family. What's your favorite holiday food?
3254,"Yep! Lets see, I really enjoy the ham, and turkey and dressing for sure! Then there's the desserts!"
3254,"Deserts are definitely my favorite part! I also love seasonal coffees, cider, and hot chocolate."
3254,Mmmm yes I had forgotten about the seasonal drinks and stuff! So yes the food is great but holidays are still depressing to me..
3254,I'm really sorry about that. I hope you find a way to spend it with your friends this year!
3254,Thanks I will try my best thank you very much and I hope you really enjoy yours!
3255,You're right. My dog was a part of my family. It's tough. It doesn't help that I'm already an insecure person. My dog really made me feel more secure.
3255,If you don't mind me asking what breed of dog was it?
3255,He was a chow. A really cute and fluffy dog. He was very loyal. Do you have any dogs?

3257,Only when we were younger.
3257,My sister and I are better but we are just so different.  We have two totally different personalities.
3257,Hm genetic background can sometimes be really differnt which might account for that difference.

3267,"It is hard to master discipline, however I think with positive reinforcement, progress can be made."
3267,"I agree.....many times it is in baby steps, but over time, it works."
3267,It's just about consistency.  Otherwise you will keep setting yourself back and not making progress.
3267,"Yes, you have to do it at every opportunity or it will not work well."
3267,How is your discipline?  Are you happy with where you are?
3267,"Yes, I am very happy.   Everything is good here."
3267,That's wonderful that everything is going well for you!  
3267,Thanks.   I hope it is for you as well.
3267,"It is, thank you.  Although I could use a bite to eat.  Do you know any take out places that you'd suggest?  I definitely don't cook!"
3267,"Oh yes, there are several in this area which are very good.   ChikFilet, Wendy's, Popeyes, just to name a few."
3267,Sounds great!  I'll have to try one!
3268,I like to sing but my girlfriend irritates me and doesn't appreciate my skills.
3268,Maybe try a sing along with her to get her to chime in 
3268,Maybe. I'd rather go out and leave her at home.
3268,That might be a good idea! Sometimes time alone can be beneficial 
3268,What do you like to do in your spare time?
3268,Netflix. Lots and lots of netflix haha
3268,I like Netflix. Hulu too. But I don't have a lot of time to watch.
3268,"Ahh yes, I have very little down time for myself as well. When I do I just like to relax at home."
3268,It is important to take time to relax. Do you like dancing?
3268,I like to dance alone in my mirror! lol. I can't dance properly to save my life.
3268,I am a poor dancer but I have fun doing it.
3268,That is what is most important. Dance like nobody is watching haha
3269,ok
3269,Do you watch Dancing with the Stars?  Talking about the Salsa reminded me of it.
3269,yes 
3269,You are not saying much.  Seems you are not much of a conversationalist.
3269,not its not like that
3269,Okay then who is your favorite this season?
3269,season 27 and yours
3269,No who is your favorite star this year?
3269,bruno tonioli's and yours
3269,Lauren Alaina. Her accent cracks me up it is so strong and southern.
3269,great
3269,Are you okay? Once again not much to say considering this is supposed to be a conversation.
3269,no not its not a conversation but still we are communicating
3270,No not really which is a good thing because I only sleep 3 hours a day
3270,What keeps you up all night?
3270,"I'm not sure, I think I have sleep apneia or something lol"
3270,"So what do you do then? Watch movies, read?"
3270,"Yes and I like to eat, my favorite meal is steak, what is yours?"
3270,Steak is my favorite too! And ice cream lol
3270,"Yea I like ice cream too, strawberry is awesome"
3270,Salted caramel and peanut butter haha
3270,That sounds yummy !
3270,Do you exercise? 
3270,"Sometimes, I do, do you?"
3270,Every day lol
3271,I am in college as well. I like to swim when I can.
3271,I love swimming. And what's your major in college?
3271,I am majoring in engineering. It is tough.
3271,"Oh, I bet it's tough. Have you been to any dorm parties?"
3271,Nothing big. The school is pretty tough on big parties. How about you?
3271,I've been to a few but I should try to study more and party less which is so hard.
3271,"Yeah, it is really easy to get distracted around here. There is always something going on."
3271,That is true. College is very hard but it is also rewarding in the end.
3271,"Definitely, I am hoping this hard work pays off. I just have to keep my focus."
3271,Yes you should try meditation to keep your energy levels up and focus. It helps me
3271,Where did you learn how to meditate? It sounds interesting.
3271,"If you search it on Youtube, you will learn easy steps to do it."
3272,That sounds great. I'll have to try it.
3272,Yeah. It is really good. I really enjoy baking and I think cooking in general is great too. What about you?
3272,"I enjoy cooking, but I probably don't do it as much as I should. I'm bad at the planning ahead part."
3272,"Yeah. Cooking can be a real task at times, but can be rewarding. It's great that I can be a woman and have great cooking skills. LOL"
3272,"I'd like to try baking more, I think. One of the best gifts I got for my last birthday was a cake someone made me."
3272,That really sweet. It's great that you have a friend that cares enough to make you a cake. I've never had that experience.
3272,"Maybe you need to hint. Or just tell them, if hints are to subtle. I never mind being told what to get, it makes life easier."
3272,"Yeah, maybe a hint would be useful. I definitely should drop one next time!"
3272,"Well, any other good tips for aspiring cooks? You seem to know a lot about it."
3272,Just practice makes perfect. I've been baking and cooking for many years.
3272,Practice I can do. Anything where your failures count as progress is right in my line.
3272,So true. You can improve unless you fail sometimes.
3272,Or a lot. 
3273,what kinds of animals do you have? I understand that feeling all too well
3273,I have a very large black lab/border collie mix. He's huge but fun.
3273,"Awh that sounds like so much fun. I love big dogs, they are such goofs"
3273,He's really goofy and very exuberant. I adopted him from the SCPA last June. Do you have any pets?
3273,"I do not currently have any pets, but i am hoping to foster a cat soon"
3273,I have a tuxedo cat. She spends the day taunting the dog :) 
3273,that is absolutely adorable! I wish i could have a cat and dog duo
3273,"Maybe someday, right? Do you go to school?"
3273,"I am currently in college, so in about 7 years when i graduate from vet school i will adopt a dog"
3273,Are you enjoying your college experience?
3273,"so far it has been fantastic! I absolutely love college, i tend to skip some classes though, freedom goes to the head"
3273,I went to Cal and with San Francisco so close I skipped a few classes myself.
3274,Oh no. I'm so sorry. Why do you think he left?
3274,Oh he was cheating on me; we had a great relationship so I never expected it
3274,I'm so sorry. I just wish I could be in a relationship. It's hard being Hindu in Louisiana.
3274,"I could imagine, being a Louisianian myself"
3274,It's nice to meet a fellow neighbor. What do you like to do?
3274,I like to play ultimate frisbee and go hiking when I can!
3274,I love frisbee! I'm currently taking a class on baking. Would like to be as good as my Mom one day. She's the best in our family.
3274,I would love to be good at baking some day! I'm terrible at it
3274,I feel ya. I'm slowly getting better though. I'm gonna try to bake a German Chocolate Cake later today!
3274,oh yummy ! i am jealous . that sounds amazing
3274,I'll eat a piece for ya! One thing I'm good at though is cooking traditional Indian cuisine. Do you like it?
3274,"I haven't had too much Indian food; there's a place in town that is pretty good, but homemade is always better"
3275,I also enjoy watching movies and cartoons. What cartoons and movies do you like?
3275,"Anime cartoon. I love those more then movies.  Stuff like  Neon Genesis,  Vampire D,  Berserk.  Im sure you never heard of any of this lol"
3275,"I have heard of a few. I don't watch Anime myself, but my husband and my niece do."
3275,So what else do you like to do with your free time?
3275,well I don't have much free time. I run a small bakery and am pretty much always working and baking. Luckily it is something that I love to do.
3276,"Oh ok, do you have a family"
3276,Yes I do. I have 1 brother and 2 sisters.
3276,"Oh I have a brother and sister, my whole family supports me riding bikes though"
3276,Mine's do to. They also want me to eat better as well and stay away from carbs. 
3276,"Oh yea i try to not eat carbs either, do you dance?"
3276,I don't. I am a bad dancer. Do you own a harley?
3276,"haha, I am a white ballet dancer..no I don't own a Harley, I wish  I did !"
3276,Oh really? Do you enjoy ballet more than riding motorcycles?
3276,Yes I like to dance more than motorcycles
3276,What makes you like dancing more?
3276,"Harleys are just so fast, I like to be more graceful"
3276,oh ok ! make sense to me !
3277,She really knows how to make me cry! haha. 
3277,haha what are you watching ? i'm trying to catch up on greys anatomy
3277,I've been watching a lot of criminal minds lately.
3277,These are old shows I have seen in the past; I prefer watching newer shows
3277,Like what? 
3277,I mostly watch on Netflix. I finished TWD lately and I am looking for another one to start
3277,I always wanted to get into TWD. Is it good?
3277,"Well, it's harsh and stressful sometimes. It started nine years ago as a simplistic people against living dead but now it's mostly people against people"
3277,I may just have to sit down and try it out! 
3277,It's certainly a captivating show about people trying to survive a post-apocalyptic epidemic but sometimes it's too much violent
3277,I love series that dont even after just a couple seasons haha. The longer the better.
3277,"OK, I started watching travelers yesterday. I am not sure I will continue."
3278,I'm addicted to gyros. There's a gyro joint down the street from my house.
3278,"yes i love gyros . i make my own sometimes. But, tacos are my favorite food! I absolutely despise spaghetti. What food do you dislike?"
3278,"I cannot stand brussels sprouts. Agree about spaghetti, too. Do you cook?"
3278,I love cooking. Thinking about becoming a chef. I love the way food brings people together.
3278,My grandmother owned a restaurant and I worked there in the summer. She never let me cook :) But she did teach me a lot about cooking.
3278,Nice!  What is your favorite dish that she taught you?
3278,"It's a German dish called rouladen. It's pounded flank steak rolled around mushrooms, onions, and pickles and then braised. I still make it."
3278,yum ! sounds good ! do you have big plans for this nice fall weekend ?
3278,The trees are all turning and I'm going to do some photography this weekend. I love photographing fall foliage. You?
3278,"that sounds like the perfect way to spend the weekend, i am sure the leaves will be beautiful in pictures. I plan on possibly going to a festival"
3278,Sounds awesome. Are you an activist like I seem to be?
3278,"Oh, no. I am far left. I am a proponent of women's rights and civil rights in general."
3279,That does sound interesting and I really enjoy playing games like call of duty and other war games. What games are your favorite?
3279,I really like arcade games. They're mine and my daughters favorite. I have two daughters.
3279,I also recently had a daughter that's now 1. I cant wait until she can play and enjoy video games with me.
3279,"Daughters are a special thing. I really love being a mother. My husband died a couple years ago, it's been hard and I'm raising them by myself. "
3279,I'm very sorry to hear that and i cant imagine. yes they are something else. My wife and I couldn't have imagined how wonderful it is being parents. 
3279,"Thanks! I wouldn't wish it on anyone, but I'm a survivor. Being a parent is indeed wonderful. Do you plan on having more children?"
3280,"i have a cat, his name is mater."
3280,That's a great name. :) My cat's name was Midnight. I had him it seemed forever. How long did you have yours
3280,mater is still living with me. He is so playful he plays ball with me.
3280,My dog rocky loves to play fetch. He also likes going with me on hikes in the mountains. 
3280,once me and mater were watching cars and we both love lightning mcqueen. whats your favourite disney character?
3280,"That's cool, my favorite disney character has always been Cinderella. "
3280,"sweet!. there was a time where me and mater dressed up as a Disney character, that was unforgettable."
3280,That sounds fun! I was thinking of dressing rocky up for Halloween. Any thoughts on a black lab costume?
3280,"i really don't have any ideas at the moment sorry, i will let you know when i come up with one!."
3280,Did mater like it when you dressed him up? I don't know if rocky would like it.
3280,"mater loved it, i bet rocky would love it too. you can always try."
3280,I think I will. He's pretty laid back.
3281,I don't buy lottery tickets very often. It took me years of buying one every few weeks to get that win.
3281,"Times like that are always nice and makes the round very easy, fortunately."
3281,Sure. So what do you do for a living? I teach high school.
3281,I work as a registrar at a high school
3281,"What a coincidence? How do you like it? I like being a teacher over all, but it has its ups and downs."
3281,i love it i love working with the kids..like you said it has up and down days lol. 
3281,So you have any kids of your own? I've got two young ones myself.
3281,"Yes I do, 25 and 23. I have a 2year old grand son"
3281,"Oh, wow. I'm a ways off from that, but I think I'm looking forward to it. Grandparenting looks like it's more consistently fun than parenting.."
3281,I love it!  What subject do you teach?
3281,"History. It probably wasn't the best field to go into, but it's what I find interesting."
3281,Awesome! Hows the weather where you are?
3282,What would you like to know
3282,what do you enjoy doing for fun? I enjoy going horseback riding
3282,I am a huge nerd and enjoy cosplaying and going to conventions
3282,"I would love to cosplay at some point! I am saving up for a Tohru cosplay currently, i also plan on going to a convention in december"
3282,I like to go as characters from a show called Steven universe
3282,"I love steven universe! I am currently listening to the soundtrack, im listening to For Just One Day Lets Only Think About Love"
3282,Have you seen the movie yet?
3282,"Yep! I saw it a few days ago and made me cry, i no longer like rose "
3282,I love Rose. She is one of my favorite Characters. You have to remember that we are watching her story in reverse. 
3282,"That is true, but seeing Spinel sing Drift Away broke my heart"
3282,It was very sad. But PD didn't know any different. Spinel was literally just a toy. It wasn't until she came to earth that she learned to be better.
3282,"Very true very true, it kinda reminds me a little of toy story, if toy story had a sad ending"
3283,"I am not a huge fan of police officers in my area, some are crooked."
3283,They are certainly. These speed traps are just another way of collecting taxes. I bought a dashcam after I was given a stop ticket that I did not deserve
3283,"Oh yes, They do a lot of things that aren"
3283,"I did a bit of research and in my area, most cops are dedicated to ticket duties and they have quotas"
3283,"That is true, they are. I like running laps around my street area but cops are always messing with someone."
3283,Do you enjoy driving? 
3283,I like running more to keep fit but yes I do enjoy driving too. Especially in the city when its dark.
3283,"Yes, I enjoy running too, but I am mostly a day person. But during the winter it gets dark very early."
3283,"My mom is a day person to, me and my dad are night people. People swear I have brown hair instead of red because i'm mostly out during night."
3283,"Well, I have a lot of red in my hair too and it's one of my favorite color. "
3283,That's cool. My favorite color is Blue. 
3283,Blue is great too; I prefer that color for clothing
3283,Yeah I love blue hoodies and shirts.
3284,"That's cool, I don't have a car because I live in the city. Public transportation is really good."
3284,"I wish we had public transportation in the city that I live in, but it's too rural. "
3284,Oh that's too bad. Where do you live? I live in New York for school.
3284,I live in the bible belt. Things are spaced far apart and there's not a lot of city infrastructure.
3284,Oh that's too bad. What kind of car do you have?
3284,I have a Mercedes
3284,Oh cool! I used to have a VW Golf but i've never had a Mercedes. 
3284,I have heard the VW Golf is a good little car
3284,Yeah it was a great car! I miss it!
3284,"You said you go to school, what do you go to school for? "
3284,I'm in school to be an artist.
3284,That sounds awesome
3285,"I do them pretty frequently now, since they say practice makes perfect and stuff!  "
3285,"Wow that is very cool, I love to ride around. Do you do tricks on the ramps?"
3285,"I only know a few tricks really.  The first trick I learned, a flipkick, was from a guy at a concert.  "
3285,"Ahh that's awesome! I'm so scared that I will mess up if I try a kickflip, any advice?"
3285,"Well, I guess it's mostly all about confidence.  Just having the confidence will let you fall a ton! haha"
3285,"Okay sure, I'll definitely give it another go then. I've mostly been doing ollies at the moment."
3285,You should try to find friends at the park to practice your ollies with!  Better with friends!
3285,"I'll keep that in mind, where would you normally meet someone else who is into skateboarding?"
3285,A skatepark of course.  You just have to dive on in with that confidence I was talking about. 
3285,Oh okay I will give that a go then! Is your local skatepark quite close to you?
3285,"Yes, but that's because I live in a city.  If you live in the country, it might be a bit harder."
3285,I visit the city quite often so maybe I will have a look around and see if there are any nearby!
3286,I think it happens a few times a year
3286,Is it dangerous to view a solar eclispe
3286,"Yes, if you look directly at it it'll burn your corneas "
3286,Wow
3286,What do you know about Eclipses?
3286,I know that its when the sun is blocked by the moon
3286,Yea that
3286,I wonder when the next eclispe will happen
3286,It'll probably happen sometime in 2020
3286,I am probably gonna buy glasses so i can view it
3286,That is a smart idea haha don't want to burn your eyes too badly
3286,yep
3287,the cabin needs some work done one it before the winter comes. 
3287,What type of work needs to be done?
3287,The chimney needs to be cleaned and there is wood to be chopped for winter. 
3287,Those are two very important tasks! Will you clean the chimney and chop the wood yourself?
3287,"I will yes, I live alone. It is hard work, but I enjoy it. My husband passed long ago."
3287,"I am impressed with your determination. I am also very sorry for your loss, how long has he been gone? "
3287,"It is rewarding work even alone. He has only been gone for 3 years, so I am still adjusting. "
3288,yes they are very nice
3288,I have the one good friend that I met in my childhood. What do you do?
3288,I work as a teacher at a high school. What do you do?
3288,I am still a high school student. I am trying to find work while going to school.
3288,Awesome trying to make money and get your high school diploma.  What grade are you in?
3288,I am a senior. I am trying to save up for college. It is tough to focus on money and school.
3288,yes i hear you. Schools the most important thing right now.  College how exciting for you!! 
3288,Yes. College is the next big step!
3288,Hows the weather where you are?
3288,Cold and rainy. It is usually pretty warm this time of year. How about you?
3288,"sounds like here too, tonight is homecoming so were hoping the rain holds off."
3288,Are you excited? Sounds like it would be a fun time.
3289,"Wow! That is a lot, I wish I could commit to writing as well as she did. Do you like to write?"
3289,I never really tried it!
3289,"I get that. I have always wanted to write more, but I worry I'm not very good at it. What do you like to do in your free time?"
3289,I do not have much free time since I have two jobs
3289,You must be super busy! I just work part time right now so I can help care for my mother. What fields do you work in?
3289,I am a bartender so I get to meet a lot of cool people!
3289,That sounds like a lot of fun. I love meeting lots of different people. I bet that job can be stressful though.
3289,yes it is but fun at times . what do you like to do in your spare time ?
3289,I read a good bit. Really any kind of book I can get my hands on. I also go to yoga a few times a week. Have you ever been?
3289,No I have not but Im super interested in trying it
3289,It is fun! Keeps me in great shape and helps me clear my mind. I highly recommend it! Hopefully you'll have more free time soon to try.
3289,Thanks so much! I hope I will too!
3290,You only have three toes on your right foot?
3290,Freak accident involving eggs and a panda... I can't say more without incriminating myself.
3290,It must make running really hard.
3290,That's very true. Thankfully I don't have to run very often.
3290,"I love to run, some say that I run really fast."
3290,"That's a good talent to have, especially in case of an apocalypse or zombie outbreak!"
3290,Yes I agree. It is also a healthy activity.
3290,"Great point, we could all use more exercise and better health activities."
3290,Yes I agree. I think everyone should try to run a few times a week.
3290,"well, maybe not me with the missing toes and all"
3290,Maybe you could find a non-running activity for you to do.
3290,"That would be good, hopefully something outdoors and with animals."
3291,I dropped out of school due to my drinking problem
3291,Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.  Are you getting some help for the alcoholism?
3291,I did. I have four years clean now
3291,Wow!  Congratulations.  That is something to be VERY proud of.
3291,No need to applaud a duck for swimming lol
3291,"I believe a victory is a victory.  Since I've never had alcohol, I don't know the effects, but the struggle is real."
3291,Good for you. Keep it that way. It's a hard door to close once it's open
3291,I probably make up for it with my social anxiety.  LOL
3291,That can be a very difficult thing to overcome. 
3292,I have cats too! How many do you have?
3292,i have one
3292,"Nice I have two, any other pets?"
3292,3 dogs. and you?
3292,2 cats and a bird. Pets are so much fun to have
3292,yes they are a lot of work lol
3292,"True, I could never have dogs because of how often you have to walk them"
3292,yes we have to walk them daily or they get mad. 
3292,It's good exercise at least. You wouldn't need a gym membership
3292,true.  hows the weather where you are?
3292,It's really cold! Late autumn is my least preferred time of the year
3292,is cold and rainy here.
3293,"Yeah, I was mad at first, and then I kind of laughed about it. "
3293,"It is one of those things that you kind of have to laugh at, isn't it? The hazards of having a parrot."
3294,My pet is a skunk. I had the gland removed to not have to worry about the spray.
3294,I think the smell is similar to brewing coffe
3294,I smell it a lot driving on country roads. The smell can go on for miles.
3294,Always shocks me when I see one run over and wait for the smell to come in the car
3294,"Yeah, I know it isn't harmful but I hold my my breadth when passing roadkill. "
3294,I've heard they have good personalities
3294,They do! They are very playful and suprisingly affectionate.
3294,Pepe LePew is what I think of when skunks come up in conversation
3294,I wonder part of the cartoon was to make people less hostile towards skunks.
3294,Didn't trappers use to make hats from skunk hides?
3294,"Yeah, I think it was necessary back then. Now, I think the practice is awful."
3294,PETA would punish anyone that used fur to make clothing hat wear today
3295,"That sounds great. Do you grill, or do you prefer to cook inside?"
3295,I like both actually. Do you have a preference?
3295,This time of year? Outside no question. Enjoy the season while it lasts.
3295,I could not agree more. I know I enjoy being outside with the family and cooking. 
3295,"Yeah. I recently started working nights, though, so it's cut into my time to do stuff like this. Only bad thing about the job."
3295,What kind of job is that? It sounds like it has other nice things.
3295,"Warehouse inventory. It pays well, and the job's a lot less hectic at night, so I like it. How about you, what do you do for a living?"
3295,"That sounds nice, yes. I am in the military. So it is a variable schedule. "
3295,"Cool. Do you move around a lot, or are you mostly in one place?"
3295,"Yes, every two years or more. My family enjoys it. New places, new people. "
3295,"It sounds fun, but tough. I wouldn't mind being able to travel more, though."
3295,That is a short summary for it. Just like everything it has its challenges. 
3296,How many dogs do you have?
3296,I have 2 dogs! What about you?
3296,I have a cat and a goldfish. Are dogs a lot of work?
3296,They definitely can be. It really depends on the breed. Some dogs are more energetic than others. But my two are pretty small and sleep a lot. 
3296,Nice. I like bringing my cat outside to get some fresh air
3296,I love cats too. You can get yours to go outside? I feel like mine would just run away!
3296,Yeah mine is pretty social. He like interacting with people!
3296,"That is super awesome! Besides hanging out with the cat, what else do you like to do in your spare time?"
3296,I play video games and hang out with friends. How about you?
3296,Video games as well. Love to play fps and mmos. What's your game of choice?
3296,I like league of legends the most
3296,"I have tried so hard to be good at league. Unfortunately, I am not! Lol! I do still play a good bit though."
3297,That's awesome I also want to go to vatican city
3297,Yeah I think that would be cool! Although it could get boring.
3297,How come?
3297,I am not religious so the pope doesnt make me excited
3297,Yeah I understand. What other places have you visited?
3297,I have been to Greece! it is very pretty
3297,I have always wanted to go to greece. I hear Santorini is beautiful
3297,It is but they have many beautiful islands to go to
3297,Yeah I can imagine. What are your favorite hobbies?
3297,"Hunting, fishing and computers but I live in a city so I dont get much time for that"
3297,I have never gone fishing but I do love eating seafood
3297,What type of seafood?
3297,"clams, scallops, shrimp, lobster, crab"
3298,"Yeah, but I love watching sea creatures in tv."
3298,"Cool, do you have any hobbies?"
3298,"Oh, yeah! I love watching movies with my kids,acyually, I have 5 kids. How about you?"
3298,I have a son. That's it and he's a handful lol.
3298,"Lol! By the way, are you aware of Micropterus?"
3298,Nope what's that?
3298,It's a family of Salmon Fish! I think your so will enjoy eating it with you at the restaurant.
3298,hmm sound good. So what do you and your family do for fun?
3298,My wife and my kids loves fishing. We normally go out every month to fish! They are nature lovers. lol. How old is your son?
3298,My is 8 and he love collecting seashells. I like doing that as well.
3298,That's good of a father & son bonding! I'm pretty sure he's as smart and as active as you.
3298,I don't know he might be smarter lol.
3299,hows the weather where you are?
3299,"Cloudy and dark here, nothing really exciting"
3299,sounds like our weather/.
3299,Whats it like where you are?
3299,rainy and cold
3299,Guess we just have to stay indoors
3299,and work lol
3299,"true, cant wait to summer"
3299,i love the 4 seasons summer here was long and so hot
3299,"Summer where i am is unpredictable, sometimes cold and rainy other times perfect"
3299,do you like to fish?
3299,Ive never been fishing always wanted to though
3300,We had a wonderful dinner together and exchanged presents. I knitted a sweater for my mom.
3300,So sweet! I spent time with my family too. Do you like other holidays?
3300,Yes! It is the only time I see my family. Christmas is defiantly my favorite. How about you? 
3300,Christmas is up there for me. I'm looking forward to Halloween for sure. Love dressing up
3300,Yes! This will be my first daughters halloween where she will dress up. I am very excited. 
3300,Awesome! What is she dressing up as?
3300,wonder woman. We still need to get costumes for ourselves though. What will you wear?
3300,I'm going as the joker. I loved the movie and dressing up as him is so fun
3300,Wow! I have to see the movie still. I heard it is really great.
3300,Yeah. one of the best this year. Do you like watching movies?
3300,"Yes, but I do not watch many lately due to time issues. Having a 1 year old sure takes that away. "
3300,"True, I have lots of free time since I'm single"
3301,Exams are important.
3301,"Yeah, that is true. I should spend more time studying and less time shopping. "
3301,"In the long run, I think that would be more beneficial."
3301,I do too. It is hard when I work in a shopping environment. I am glad you would still care for me though.
3301,Absolutely. Perhaps you should look for a new gig?
3301,"I have considered this, the hours are long and the pay is terrible. Maybe something more relevant to my degree. "
3301,What is your degree?
3301,Finger painting. 
3301,That seems highly specialized. What type of work do you think you could do?
3301,"I dream to finger paint the white house one day, maybe a lovely abstract mural, reminiscent of Monet's lillies. "
3301,That would be a legendary job. It could take a really long time.
3301,Oh absolutely. Very prestigious though. Maybe do other murals. Fingers get tired though. 
3302,I only took a few classes in highschool. Most of it didn't stick.
3302,"I did take a bit of french in high school as well. However, I don't use it much now either."
3302,"Yeah, spanish would come in handy here more than other foreign languages. Wish I paid more attention."
3302,That's how it is in high school. We are focused on other things like sports or dating.
3302,Too true. At least I learned how to bake in high school. That stuck with me.
3302,That's a great skill to have. What type of food do you like to cook?
3302,I like to make cakes and other sweets. I have a bit of a sweet tooth.
3302,"Oh I absolutely adore cakes. My favorite would be carrot cake. Sadly, baking is not my strong point."
3302,Carrot cake is good. It isn't too hard to learn a few simple recipes. You might suprise yourself.
3302,"I'd certainly give it a try. I'm not big on trying new things personally, but I'll never expand my horizons if I don't."
3302,Never hurts to learn something new.
3302,Agreed. You are quite good at encouraging others. Is that part of your profession by chance?
3303,"I like to fish, it is very relaxing."
3303,yes it is very relaxing to me .
3303,One time when fishing I accidentally hooked a boot. 
3303,"wow , that is crazy ! that never happened to me before !"
3303,It was hilaruious
3303,lol ! did you have to pay for it ? bet it would be expensive!
3303,No it was free! I gave it to my dog Bob... he used it as a chew toy.
3303,Well that worked out for you then.
3303,Sure did. Do you have any good secrets?
3303,no i just make boats on the weekend . what else do you do ?
3303,I like to sing and play the piano. I like jigsaw puzzles and also I am a cannibal. I am currently working on a 1000 piece puzzle of kittens.
3303,Cannibal? Really? That's a weird hobby.
3303,Very weird!
3304,Then it turned out that my boss did not even like the coffee! It was like $5 at starbucks! there was a clown in line! Me!
3304,You mean Fivebucks?
3304,"Hahahahah, Thats good! I guess I have to take the subway home! Talk about a footlong walk!"
3304,HAHAHA....call an uber
3304,There's probably a murderous clown driving it! No way am I going to be the next It. 
3304,Clowns have really changed from when I was a kid....Bozo had his own show...now he is a serial killer
3304,"Well, I'm terrified of them now ! Such a mess! Should have stayed non-scary! At least the subway I take is cheap and kinda fast. lol "
3304,When will you get your car back?
3304,"Probably in a week or two, Massive Bill! Sorry about changing the topic!  "
3304,Has your boss offered any assistance?
3304,I'm to scared to ask!  He is like a bomb just waiting for me.
3304,Is your job that good you have to work for a horrible boss?
3305,"Yeah, I'm incredibly excited!"
3305,wow that is awesome what is your favorite antique you have
3305,"a really old signed first edition of a book called Caleb West, Master Diver. Do you collect things? "
3305,no i don't collect anything
3305,"You should give it a try, you can collect just about anything and it's a really rewarding feeling"
3305,Well I work on trucks all day and I'm tired when I get home
3305,"that's understandable, do you have any pets? I collect pets too haha"
3305,Yes. I have a Doberman. I love to take him to the dog park. 
3305,"Dobermans are so large, I've never had one but they look so fun to play with!"
3305,He's a lot of fun. He loves frisbee. 
3305,"Nice, I bet that gives you a lot of exercise."
3305,Yeah. He like to run and he loves to play. 
3306,Yep
3306,"Wow, you will get used to it :D"
3306,"Its gonna take a while, so hot"
3306,How long was the flight? 
3306,8hr
3306,That's not too bad
3306,"the flight was pretty good, not bad service. Food was meh"
3306,Food in the flight is always meh. I have been to flights more than 20 hours long :x
3306,wow 20hrs what did you do?
3306,"Nothing really, just tried to sleep, watched few movies and got bored. It was awful and the whole body was sore next day."
3306,I can imagine
3306,"I am traveling to barbados next month, hoping it goes smoothly "
3306,goodluck
3306,Thanks
3307,That sounds yummy. What's your favorite pizza topping?
3307,i like chicken and purple onion.  What's your favorite toppin?
3307,I love mushroom and italian sausage. the pizza parlor I work has really good italian sausage
3307,sounds yummy. how's the weather where you are/
3307,It's very cold right now especially since it is raining. How is the weather where you are?
3307,rainy and cold here too.
3307,Yeah I can imagine. do you have siblings?
3307,yes one sister. Do you?
3307,Yes I am the oldest of three other brothers
3307,cool do you have any kids?
3307,No I don't have kids but would like to have some one day. Do you have kids?
3307,yes 2 a boy and a girl
3307,That's awesome. I definitely want 2 kids. A boy and a girl
3308,Wow! Do you know if she did any make up for face off on say? It is my favorite show. 
3308,I am not familiar with that show.  What kind of show is it?
3308,Hmm I would call it a reality tv Drama. I watch it at exactly 7pm every week thursday. I won't miss it. 
3308,Ahh...and what is it about?  I like reality tv
3308,Generally every episode one or two people are put head to head in a battle of wits with riddles. 
3308,That sounds like a great show.  Sometimes reality tv is a bit shallow....but I like a real competition.
3308,Yes I totally agree. I really enjoyed survivor for the first few seasons. It was a blast!
3308,"YES, definitely...although sometimes that show grosses me out. LOL"
3308,Yes..some of the eating challenges can bother some people haha
3308,Do you think you could do some of those challenges?
3308,"Defiantly, I am not easily grossed out. We did some survivor nights when i was a teenager. Fun!"
3308,I think I would be voted off the island in the first episode. LOL
3309,Yes she is.  How are you today?
3309,doing good.. how about you
3309,its friday lol i cant complain.
3309,You have any plans for today?

3309,seems like its raining every where.  do you have plans this weekend

3309,me either
3309,Probably gonna watch tv and play video games
3309,lol watching football
3309,"Cool, what team do you support"
3309,browns lol
3310,A park with a zipline and climing web. I don't remember the name.
3310,I'm sure you'll figure it out. What time?
3310,5 clock
3310,"Good, I'm no good in the mornings!"
3310,Me either. Never was.
3310,Have you checked the weather yet?
3310,Yes. It's going to be a bit cold for here.
3310,"Cool, I can wear my new coat then. As long as it doesn't rain."
3310,Me too.
3310,I'll text you tomorrow.
3310,Ok. See you then
3310,Can't wait!
3311,Oh that's cool! You know a lot about music! 
3311,I really dont. I just pretend. I do love some Cardi Pardi though
3311,Lol! I don't know much about music too! But I love to play basketball and my grandma likes to make a pizza with me.
3311,"I also love sports!, Who doesnt love theirs family and pizza? That is unamerican. What is your favorite pizza"
3311,"Well, I love everything especially super supreme. How about you?"
3311,"I love hawaiian, yes pineapple on pizza. What is a super supreme?"
3311,"Super supreme is a combination of different stuff such as vegetables, cheese and meat. "
3311,Woah! That sounds like an amazing pizza. Very filling I imagine.
3311,"Yes, it is! My grandma is an expert of making pizza. By the way what sports are you into?"
3311,I love hockey. Very elegant and tough at the same time. 
3311,"Oh, yeah! That's pretty cool! I don't know much about hockey but that sounds interesting."
3311,"My brother used to play and still skates like a dream. Amazes me to this day, since I routinely fall down."
3312,What other rappers do you like if you dont mind me asking
3312,"Deftones, they have been around for awhile"
3312,"Ok cool i get it, my favorite rapper of all time is Jay-Z"
3312,JAy-Z is dope too. I also like Drake and Nas
3312,Yeah Drake is cool but I would have to agree with you about Nas being in my top 5 rappers of all time
3312,Yeah Nas is definitely top 5. I also really like biggie
3312,Yes biggie as well. What about 2-Pac do you know the legend rapper 2-Pac?
3312,Oh of course. Dear momma is probably my favorite song from him
3312,"Definitely Dear momma but lets not forget about the classic song Brenda's Got a Baby, one of my favorite from 2-Pac"
3312,Oh that is definitely a classic. Also I Get Around is my favorite too
3312,Well i guess we can agree that 2-Pac makes both of our list of Best rappers of all time
3312,Definitely. I love his double disc albums All Eyez on Me that was released in 1996
3313,An apple! She knows i want to be a teacher.
3313,Teachers amaze me. Unfortunately they are some of the most underpaid people in the world! 
3313,That's very true. I'm worried that once I get a job I won't be able to pay back my student loans.
3313,That is such a shame that the student loans are so high. Is being a teacher your dream job?
3313,"Yes. I think my ultimate dream job would be as a professor at a research university, but there are very few openings."
3313,That is definitely a neat goal. Just keep trying and you will get there one day.  
3313,"I hope so! What about you, what is your dream job? "
3313,"I would love to become a nurse, I love to help people. "
3313,We need more nurses in the world!
3313,Absolutely!  I am a stay home mother right now and that keeps me too busy to go back to school at this time.
3313,Being a stay at home mom is an important job too. 
3313,It is the hardest and most demanding job I've ever had. Do you have children?
3314,The old 1890s-1900's cars are very interesting.
3314,Yeah for sure my dad works in the industry and loves those cars! What do you drive?
3314,I drive a volvo. I love cars too.
3314,How do you like your volvo?
3314,I like it a lot - I've had it 16 years.
3314,Wow thats great I have heard a lot of new volvos dont last very long
3314,Hmm. that's not good news for me.
3314,Maybe you got lucky!
3314,"You said new ones - as I said, this one's 16 years old. I'm looking for a new car."
3314,What type of car were you thinking? Nissans last forever
3314,I might get a Tesla if I can.
3314,Ooh very cool what model?
3315,Wow! That's a lot of cars!
3315,"Yeah! Toyota also made the AE-86, the main car in ""Initial D"""
3315,I'm not sure I know what that means.
3315,It is a Japanese anime that is really popular
3315,"Oh okay, I don't watch much TV."
3315,"That's okay. I really like cars too, Toyota has remade the 86"
3315,Toyota is the only car I drive!
3315,That's a good car to drive. I also like Mazda though too.
3315,I guess they're okay. Really don't much experience with them since all I've ever had is Toyota.
3315,"Do you prefer sedans, suv's, or trucks?"
3315,Crossovers or SUV's mostly.
3315,I bet those are good in the snow
3316,I had a bad experience at a debutante ball once
3316,"Sorry to hear that, what happened? I generally love all operas"
3316,I lost my diamond ring at one 
3316,Oh no! Was that an engagement ring or wedding ring? It must have been very expensive. 
3316,It was my wedding ring. I had gotten my nails done earlier that day and put it in my purse.
3316,"Wow, how long ago was that? Any chance of getting it back? That must be very distressing. "
3316,It has been a couple years and the police never caught the guy.  Tell me about the wine you brought from Paris.
3316,That is too bad. I got some expensive french red wine. I could have bought a car for the price! haha
3316,You must be a real wine lover to spend so much. I love red wine but usually spend around $25
3316,Generally I would not spend so much....but when in paris....haha! 
3316,I would love to go to Paris someday. Is it as romantic as they say?
3316,"Generally yes, but it really depends on who you go with!"
3317,Their dog suffered some minor bites. People should be more careful with their pets.
3317,Do the dogs have training classes now?
3317,I am not sure if she is taking her dog to classes. She should consider it to work on its aggression.
3317,"I agree, a little training would be great. I am a teacher and I actually took some classes to be a dog trainer. I might be able to help."
3317,"That is interesting. My dog is pretty protective when my sister's twins are here. Luckily, they were not attacked."
3317,I've really glad you and your do are getting along well. Dogs are mans best friend after all!
3317,They sure are. I have always had a dog in my life.
3317,A fellow animal lover! How old were you when you had your first dog?
3317,My parents have photos of me as a baby with the family dog. We had a beagle.
3317,Well that is adorable! I had one too but the only thing that I would hate is that I love to garden and he loved to destroy my garden lol
3317,I had one dog that liked to dig. I am just glad not all of them like to do it. Takes some work to fill all those holes.
3317,You are right on that. Did you at least had fun while filling the holes back?
3318,just my husband.  We need sometime away.
3318,Sounds amazing! Where do you think you might go?
3318,We are going on a cruise. I have never been and am very excited. 
3318,Wow that's awesome I haven't been on one either. Are you going to the Bahamas?
3318,No we want to go to alaska. Weird for a cruise but I like different. 
3318,No I think those Alaska cruises are beautiful! You should try to see the northern lights while you're there too!
3318,That is what I am hoping to see. They seem so amazingly beautiful in pictures and video. 
3318,"They really are, pictures do them no justice. I've only seen them once I think you'll have a really great trip!"
3318,Very Cool. Where did you see them?
3318,"In Minnesota, I'm sure it wouldn't compare to what you can see in Alaska though. How long will you go for?"
3318,So beautiful. The cruise for a week roughly. 
3318,Sounds like the trip of a lifetime. Even if you don't see the lights you'll see beautiful mountains I'm sure.
3319,I also like to Fly model airplanes and go Kayaking!
3319,It sounds like you're pretty active!
3319,I am! Kayaking is such a nice way to spend some time on the open water! 
3319,Well I can't swim so that's out for me. 
3319,I can't swim.. I love taking risks! All about the adventure!
3319,I'm more of the stay at home type. I work at a vet's office. 
3319,Aww! Whats your favorite animal? 
3319,I love cats. I have two myself. Dylan and T'kia
3319,"Aw I have two cats, (Fuzzy Wuzzy and Patches) There from the same litter and two doggies! (Roxy and poppy!)"
3319,You certainly have a lot to keep you busy!
3319,Yeah! Sadly my dogs don't like the water! No doggy kayak!
3319,I think it would scare them
3320,Thats cool to know do you like the taste of them?
3320,I love beets in Indian food. I don't really like them plain.
3320,Whats your favorite Indian dish?
3320,I love porial. and Uttapam. and all the vegetable curries. I'm vegetarian.
3320,I have never heard of them! I know a lot of indian food is vegetarian!
3320,Uttapam is kind of an indian pizza
3320,wow that sounds so good! Why did you become a vegtarian?
3320,My wife and I did 30 years ago. It just happened. And we've raised our kids all vegetarian.
3320,Would you be offended if they decide to change?
3320,"Maybe, but they won't. My eldest wasn't vegetarian at first - and he used to say he'd go back. He doesn't want to now."
3320,Thats cool to hear!
3320,We all love Vegetarian food.
3321,That sounds great. I think I might get Yoga lessons for my entire family.
3321,I'm thinking of branching into tai chi as well. It's so emotionally calming. Is your family into wellness?
3321,"Well, my parents had to move, so they've been very stressed out. I think something like Yoga or Tai Chi would help them learn how to meditate."
3321,"And it's a nice, low-stress way to stay limber. Did your parents stay within the same city, or did they move elsewhere?"
3321,"They moved to Florida but they left my brother here, he has been staying with me. I think I need Yoga myself just to deal with that situation."
3321,How old is your brother?
3321,"He's in his early 20s..he's looking into colleges near here, he didn't want to live in Florida or go to school there so he stayed behind."
3321,You have your hands full! That's nice of you to let him stay with you.
3321,It definitely is a hassle but that's what family is for!
3321,That's so true - they'll always be there for you in the end. Are you in school?
3321,"I'm not in school myself, I never went to college unfortunately. I'm certainly learning a lot about it now though!"
3321,Maybe you should teach yoga. I've found it so inspiring and I love passing that knowledge on.
3322,"I wish I was overseas, want to be in France tasting all that good cheese"
3322,France would be nice... have you ever been
3322,"Only when I was younger, we went to Disney Land. How is your deployment?"
3322,"Im loving it, "
3322,I don't think I could handle being away from home for so long. Even worse if there's driving involved. How do you manage?
3322,its hard to be far from family but i love it. the driving here is not easy lol i usually take the bus where ever i need to go
3322,"I suppose you're busy doing work all the time, must make it easier. I like your thinking. When does your deployment end?"
3322,i have three more months.  hows the weather wher eyou are?
3322,"Not too long then. Thankfully it's not too bad, I can still walk everywhere. Give it a month and it'll be raining everyday, would have to drive around then unfortunately"
3322,nope not really.  do you have any kids?
3322,"No kids yet, what about you? Got a partner or kids waiting for you to come back?"
3322,my husband is here with me my two kids are grown.
3323,Yeah I also love sweets. Especially hershey's kisses
3323,I defiantly have a sweet tooth too. I love the dessert pizza that some places offer.  
3323,Oh are you talking about a cookie pizza?
3323,"I saw those at pizza hut, but I haven't tried it yet. I think the apple (pie?) Pizza at cici's is pretty yummy too!"
3323,Yes it is so good! I love cici's cinnamon rolls too
3323,"Oh yes, those are tasty too. Last time we got take out from cici's my doberman pincher got his fare share..smh"
3323,Haha he must have a sweet tooth as well. Do you have a favorite candy?
3323,"I'm definitely partial to a good old hershey kiss, but I really like most candy. How about you?"
3323,white chocolate peppermint hershey kisses are my favorite. I eat them alot especially during the holidays
3323,That sounds yummy. Did you know Herhey's products are sold in over 60 countries?
3323,Of course because they are so good and they are bite size so they are good treats for on the go
3323,That's true!! The holidays are approaching quickly so you will get to have a lot of sweet treats.
3324,Really? I had no idea. It must be a fact that is often overlooked as it is mostly associated with men these days.
3324,"It probably started as cooking the brew is required and cooking was in the domain of women for, like ever."
3324,"That's very true. I am glad that such restrictions are starting to fade away. Cooking, whether traditional or brewing, can be enjoyed by anyone."
3324,"Yeah, the starchs and sugars have to be extracted from the grains and hops before fermentation can take place."
3324,You seem to know quite a bit about this. Is this a topic you have researched before?
3324,"Oh yeah, I'm really into homebrewing, I've been doing it for 10 years, I started secretly making my own beer when I was 14."
3324,Oh wow. I thought I was bad for taking a sip of beer when I was 16. Here you were making your own even earlier.
3324,"It was truly vile stuff in the beginning, lucky I didn't go blind!"
3324,I'm sure you are much better at it now. Do you sell the brew or keep it for personal use?
3325,"We're both saving for college, but I know he'll get what we need. Maybe 5-8, so not too much."
3325,Do you mind if I bring a few friends as well? We can come over after work ill ditch early. 
3325,"Yeah, that's fine. I'll be out surfing during the day, so come over when ever you feel like."
3325,Sounds great! Ill stop by after checking out the car dealership. Im thinking of buying a toyota. 
3325,Oh nice! I've heard they are reliable.
3325,"Defiantly! Nothing says quality like toyota. But they can be very expensive, even used!"
3325,Oh really? I hadn't noticed that.
3325,"Yes, even if they are 5 years old they still might be 80% of their original price. It's crazy!"
3325,I typically buy older cars anyway.
3325,"That is a good idea, new cars are way to expensive these days. I don't want to work long hours for one car. "
3325,"Exactly, and I'm saving for college so I don't have much to spend."
3325,That is a good idea. If you are lucky a 500$ car might last you a good 10-20 years anyways. 
3326,what is her age
3326,I think she is 35.
3326,O ok no i have never heard of her i dint think.
3326,Really? She is pretty famous. She makes good music.
3326,"O ok so she a fashin designer and she make music, what kind of music she produce?"
3326,"She makes pop music. You should google her. One of her hit songs is ""Dark Horse""."
3326,"o ok yeah i know exactky who you talkin about, lol."
3326,"Good! Lol. She is really dope though, she hasn't made much music lately. I wonder what that's all about."
3326,"I have no idea, yea she havent came across the surface lately."
3326,"I did hear that she helped raise $11 million for Virtual Reality engineering, here recently."
3326,"O ok thats nice I love VR Engineering, I'm self taught in alot of computer areas."
3326,That's awesome to know. Maybe you should google Katy Perry so you can read the article about VR.
3326,will i knew thats who it was
3327,It sounds likt could be dangerous
3327,It certainly can be from what my husband tells me.
3327,I couldn't be a cop. I'm too heavy and nearsighted
3327,I get heavier everyday it seems. What do you do for work?
3327,I work in an eyeglass store. It's where I got my contacts. 
3327,Do you ever get to do eye tests for customers?
3327,Yes. It's pretty easy and it helps people. 
3327,How often should I get my eyes checked?
3327,At least once a year or if they are causing you any problems
3327,Thank you for the advice. I will advise my husband to do the same.
3327,Sounds good. 
3327,I hope you get a promotion at the eye store
3328,"Stay in school, you get lots of benefits if joining the army! Plus its hard nowadays to get it without a Diploma "
3328,Yeah it is very hard without a diploma I don't think you can even flip burgers without one!
3328,Yeah.. I was lucky! I fly airplanes! They are gonna help me go back and get my GED
3328,Wow that's really great you found that kind of opportunity. Flying planes sounds like an awesome job!
3328,I pilot the Loclheed Martin F-16c Fighting Falcon Shaw at the Air force base 
3328,Sounds pretty awesome I bet you see a lot doing that.
3328,"Yeah! The army had me fly to Iceland a month or two back, then to Australia!"
3328,That's amazing! Have you ever seen the northern lights while flying?
3328,Not yet! Hey! When you finish school you should join! My kids wanna join the Navy!
3328,Yeah I might think about it what are some of the requirements?
3328,They change the req. every year! Most likely Heath and athletic tests! Then a Placement test to see where you are fit to serve. A highschool dip or GED!
3328,I will definitely give it some thought sounds like you get to do a lot of cool stuff.
3328,Have fun!
3329,I use to watch reruns of his old TV show.  Have you watched any of those?
3329,I have not. I have trouble watching his films because there is so many better ones. 
3329,I enjoy mysteries and watch them often.  Do you enjoy reading mysteries?
3329,"I enjoy reading fantasy, romance, and drama types. Mysteries type of things. "
3329,I like to write and I am working on a mystery.  Do you enjoy writing?
3329,"That sounds beautiful. I used to enjoy writing, now I more enjoy painting. What kind of mystery?"
3329,"It's a who done it.  I have never tried painting, I don't have the talent.  What do you like to paint?"
3329,Those are great! Does it have a great twist ending? I like to paint abstracts and landscapes.
3329,"I'm still thinking about the end, haven't decided yet.  Do you sell your paintings?"
3329,I bet it will turn out great. I do not. I use them as decoration around my house.
3329,Nice I wish I could paint.  What are some of your other interests?
3329,"I enjoy walking, shopping, and sleeping"
3330,cool were they old classic cars?
3330,Yes I love old - really old - 1900's cars
3330,that's cool. hows the weather where you are?
3330,"Cold for here, it's around 50"
3330,same here. not good
3330,It's fall. I like it. It's been too hot.
3330,i enjoy the cool weather but the rain ugh we have homecoming tonight and its supose to rain. its been super hot her too
3330,"Yeah, we had some rain and a storm last night here."
3330,Do you have any kids?
3330,Yes
3330,Awesome me too.
3330,Are they scared of storms?
3330,Aww sometimes they can be scary!
3331,How carefree life was then.  My business makes life so stressful now.
3331,"Oh, I understand. What do you do?"
3331,I have my own online interior design business. I have been working really hard to get established.
3331,Sounds cool! I hope it works out for you
3331,"Me too.  I have been putting in a lot of time lately, advertising and trying to build up business."
3331,"I prefer a job with flexibility, so I can hang with my dog Percy. He's my best friend"
3331,"I love dogs, what kind of dog is Percy?"
3331,He is a border collie and loves frisbee!
3331,He sounds great. Probably a good stress reliever also.
3331,Yep. A night in with Percy and a good book is my ideal evening
3331,I like staying in also.  I like to meditate whenever I get a chance.
3331,I've never tried. Does it help you relieve stress?
3331,It is great for stress relief.  You should try it sometime. 
3332,"I'm alright, taking it one day at a time. I am also trying to prepare for surgery in December. How about you?"
3332,I have been doing fairly well. I am considering taking an night language course so I can learn another language (4th!)
3332,"That is really neat, what language? "
3332,I am not sure yet...I am considering chinese or korean. I think these may be fun to learn! 
3332,"That will take determination, but that's really cool. I need more time to do something like this. Between work and being a parent there's no time."
3332,Yes that is true. Being a parent takes up so much time....it is almost like you have no free time!
3332,Absolutely. Thankfully I have my 2 siblings whom help out a lot with my kids.
3332,"That can be very helpful. My mother helps sometimes, but being a teacher she is often to busy."
3332,Grandma's are the best helpers. How many kids do you have?
3332,Just one at the moment. She is one year old. But we are planning on having one more eventually.
3332,"I also have a one year old. My twelve year old thinks hes ""grown"" because I'm not very tall and he is. Haha"
3332,Wow that is quite an age difference. Does he help out with the little one?
3333,"I also live in Chicago, it is great."
3333,That is awesome. What activities do you enjoy there?
3333,"Going to the zoo, museums, restaurants, and shopping."
3333,That sounds nice. What sort of restaurants do you like? I appreciate that Chicago has so many vegan options. 
3333,"I enjoy the many steakhouses. Since I have diabetes, they are a good option for me."
3333,My dad has diabetes too but he was born with it. I heard veggies help a lot.
3333,"Sorry to hear about you Dad. I have two Moms, but neither of them have diabetes."
3333,"Thank you, thankfully he manages it well so I don't have to worry so much. I'm glad your moms don't have to deal with it!"
3333,"That is good, hopefully in the future nobody has to deal with it! "
3333,"I hope so too, that would be wonderful to see. Do you have anything fun planned for the weekend?"
3333,"The weather will not be so good tomorrow, but maybe on Sunday I will go for a bike ride by the lake. How about you?"
3333,"I'm thinking of taking it easy and finding some scary movies to watch over the weekend. A bike ride sounds nice, I hope you get to enjoy it."
3333,"I was never a big fan of scary movies, though it is almost Halloween... Enjoy your weekend."
3334,yes three dogs and one cat.  How about you?
3334,I dont have any right now. 
3334,hows the weather where you are?
3334,Its hot and sunny here right now. Typical Miami day. 
3334,that sounds nice. its chilly and rain here today. im in Alabama.
3334,How do you like living in Alabama?
3334,dont like it at all lol wanna move to Florida one day!
3334,I hear ya. I moved to Florida and cant see myself leaving. 
3334,sounds nice.  I cant wait.
3334,What do you do in Alabama?
3334,montgomery
3334,"Nice, do you like the Crimson Tide?"
3334,lol no ohio state
3335,I agree!!  The only animals that I like are dogs.  Animals like opossums can just be roadkill lol
3335,"I don't like dogs. My daughter wouldn't agree with you, she likes possums."
3335,How come you don't like dogs? I'd run a possum over with my red car..lol  I love red.  My lipstick is red too.
3335,I just never liked dogs. I don't like lipstick either.
3335,I love both!  I could't live without either one!
3335,"I definitely can. Sorry, don't mean to be offensive."
3335,No worries.  I understand.  Everyone has their own opinions about things.
3335,Yes. I agree.
3335,"Yes, that's what makes each one of us unique.  We'd be boring if we were all the same."
3335,Completely!
3335,For sure!  I know I'm unique!  I'm definitely me!
3335,"Me too! I don't like the people who say ""we're all the same""."
3336,That is true but girls are more high maintenance
3336,"I cant say that I agree 100%, my favourite book  is jane austins pride and prejudice - and i learned that we shouldnt stereotype people..."
3336,Oh I was not trying to stereotype. It just that I have nieces who I love dearly and spoil but when it comes to girls you have to purchase makeup
3336,"But you spend money with boys too, when they start growing up and want expensive video games lol"
3336,"Lol that's true. This is just what several of girls say also. And not just materialistic things. Emotional challenges (heartbreak, body image) "
3336,"i dont really agree, working as a tutor for english literature i learned a lot about boys and girls and boys can be very sentimental too"
3336,Don't get me wrong I agree with you. I just want to raise my boys to respect women and for girls to be their best self
3336,"for this I totally agree with you, lets keep fighting for a better world for our kids!"
3336,Yes! I want our future generation to raise the bar and treat each other respectfully and equally
3336,"yes, there was the time that women should be treated differently. what do you do to make women more equal to men?"
3336,I understand because of biological differences it is still hard to do. But I think it starts with equal pay
3336,"yep, that is a great way of starting. congrats!"
3337,O ok thats nice is English your native language.
3337,English is my second language. What kind of books do you enjoy?
3337,"I enjoy reading business books, planning to start a small business."
3337,"I've been meaning to pick up a couple books about business, expand my horizons. What kind of business are you trying to start?"
3337,"Really havent decided I actually hoping you named a book are two i could pick up on, lol,"
3337,Unfortunately I've been procrastinating too much and haven't even taken the first steps. Hopefully you find something you enjoy 
3337,"Really hoping so, One way you can start is with the book ""Why Most Small Business Fail and What to do About i""."
3337,"Thanks for the suggestion, I'll take a look into that one. So apart from books, what else do you like?"
3337,"I lov technology all together, what about yourself?"
3337,"I'm into computers but I wouldn't say I'm a technology person. Don't pay too much attention to phones, TVs, etc... I love to travel though. Theres something liberating about it"
3337,Now thats really a favorite funds are not situated for rightnow though.
3337,Yeh I completely get you. Hopefully when your business starts going you'll be able to easily afford a couple of holidays
3337,Right Thx
3338,That is understandable. Are you going to get another dog?
3338,"I don't know yet, sometimes I just like to be alone."
3338,I drive an hour to work and it's a nice time to be alone and work out my thoughts
3338,"Ugh! Not sure I could deal with that commute, but yes we definitely all need some time to be in our own heads"
3338,I love the morning sunshine on the way to work. I'm inside a building with no windows throughout the day
3338,Wow! No windows...where do you work the NSA?
3338,Communications and they put our office in the basement of the hospital.
3338,Nobody should have to have their office in the basement!  Are you happy working there?
3338,"Yes, no distractions. If I had windows I would always be wanting to go play in the sunshine."
3338,I don't think I could do it...I'd go crazy all day without seeing outside.
3338,My boss asked me to do murals at each desk. I made windows with beach scenes
3338,"Your boss sounds pretty amazing. I want to work with you guys, just not in the basement hahaha."
3339,"I agree, she took care of me as a baby and all through my life"
3339,Grandmas are the best. I miss mine. 
3339,I miss mine too. She used to garden. I like to because of her. I built a garden for her where I live in the suburbs.
3339,Gardening is not something I can do.
3339,I had a nightmare about her that she was driving (she was dead since) and a ghost flew into our car. I was the passenger.
3339,I drove once and it was fun. 
3339,I don't drive because of an anxiety disorder. I miss it.
3339,Thats too bad. So neither of us drives. We have Ubers. 
3339,Yep way better than Lyft!
3339,So what do you do for fun?
3339,Spartan racing and shooting at the range! How about you?
3339,Thats cool. I have always wanted to try that but I obviously cant. 
3340,Is it Nice there? My grandma lives there and she says it is but I have never actually been there.
3340,It is beautiful. It can get cold.
3340,I heard it gets real cold there. How long have you been living there?
3340,"Only a year, I'm a travel agent so I try to live where I send other people."
3340,Oh that's cool. How long have you been a travel agent? 
3340,For about 12 years. I love it. 
3340,Is the pay really good? I need to find a good career or job so I can get rid of my car.
3341,It was so embarrassing!
3341,Just be glad that everyone in your class probably has no memory of it now.
3342,How are you doing today?
3342,"Well. I don't speak German yet, and am doing German lessons also."
3342,well best of luck to learning.
3342,Thank you. What languages do you speak?
3342,only english.
3342,i know spanish and russian
3342,wow thats very handy i wish i knew more but i dont
3342,I use Duolingo - it's very nice.
3342,huh cool maybe i will check into that lol
3342,It only takes a few minutes a day - I've got it set on 5 minute lessons but you can do as many as you want.
3342,hows the weather there?
3342,a bit cold
3342,same here
3343,"Oh, wow you are up to a lot! Does it take a lot of time"
3343,"Yes, I enjoy handling the money and the fact I am not in high school anymore."
3343,What money do you handle?
3343,"Concerning money I am not very wealthy but I am confident in I will be in the future. How are your finances, if I may ask?"
3343,It has actually very well! I work high rewarding jobs but long hours - i have never been on a date really because of it
3343,"That's unfortunate, it has been observed that anthropologists define happiness as having as little separation as possible between your work and your play. "
3343,"Oh, really! Definitely have not found it in my life, hihi"
3343,I wish you luck.  You have to find the right balance to enjoy life to its fullest! 
3343,"Thank you! I try to thing as much as good as possible, so I would have a good karma"
3344,Would you like to try it and come salsa dancing with me sometime?
3344,that would be fun my family is into that i love them 
3344,"Sound great, maybe we could grab dinner before or after?"
3344,that would be great !

3344,awesome you should come to church next week they play the best music its my favorite
3344,What kind of music is that?
3344,religious very gospel youd love it
3345,We especially get that here in New York.
3345,It's not just New York it's all over the world. What happens in one part will effect another part.
3345,Very true. You can see it in the number of natural disasters all around. Have you been affected?
3345,I've been through many bad storms where I'm located but none that were catastrophic.
3345,That is always hard. You really feel like there is nothing you can do to help.
3345,"That is where you are wrong! Everyone of us can do our part and reduce, reuse, and recycle."
3346,yes they take the best wine you can offer
3346,Yeah although for a long time the cattle weren't even eaten nor was the milk consumed.
3346,that's tragic do you have any ideas?
3346,they are poor now but have all the buying power in next few decades .

3347,That is nice. I am worried now when I start my new business she won't be able to handle it.
3347,why is that will you be working a lot from home?
3347,No I am starting a sports apparel business as I am huge fan. I won't be home nearly as much.
3347,oh thats a shame. you will have to take him with you! 
3347,I may try to do that. Keep her on a leash in the store. She would enjoy the people I am sure.
3347,maybe you could create a small area for him out back where he can relax and have his own space 
3347,I would have to be in the back room. I could put his food and water there along with a bed.
3347,would he cause trouble if you left him alone ? ahah
3348,i'm getting a xbox x
3348,The xbox one x? Isn't that one already out?

3348,mom and dad can have you in there room\
3348,But Mom works late at the grocery store
3348,what about dad?
3348,I'm not sure where Dad is
3349,I have gotten more sociable as I have gotten older.  I think it is a matter of confidence
3349,Maybe. I think some people are just born with it.
3349,I used be very shy.  I didn't have a date in high school.  I was afraid of girls.  But now I will talk to anybody
3350,Yeah paid 200 dollars for them they was my dress shoes
3350,did you wash the shoes?

3350,I work at google only place i actually enjoy
3350,cool what do you do there?
3350,Testing of the new pixel 4 and trying to work out kinks before release date
3350,great!  I bet you make a lot of money.
3350,only 50k a year not much when you have to live in cali.
3350,I only make 30k a year.  The only time i have fun is when i eat out at restaurants
3351,"Oh, it's not that it is pizza. I love cooking, I don't eat packaged foods."
3351,Really? What kind of foods do you like?
3351,I love experimenting with all kinds of different cuisines. Lately I've been cooking a lot of Indian food. What do you like?
3351,"Oh, Indian is delicious. I love curry. It's actually one of my favorite foods.What are your hobbies?"
3351,I'm a bartender and I one of my hobbies is juggling. I love to juggle bottles when mixing drinks!
3351,How fun! I've tried juggling and cannot figure it out for the life of me. 
3351,It takes practice for sure. What are your hobbies?
3351,"I love going to concerts, especially rock. I grew up on a farm so I love the outdoors and animals as well."
3351,I love concerts too. I just can't afford them anymore. I spend all my money on cooking. All my friends love when I cook for them.
3351,They can definitely get expensive. I don't get to as many as I would like. Do you throw dinner parties?
3351,"I do, I love entertaining. What about you?"
3351,"Not really, I'm more of a guest than a party planner. lol"
3351,It was nice chatting with you. Have a great day!!
3352,"I'm also the same, it makes me feel jealous. "
3352,It's normal to be jealous. It is a product of goals not fulfilled.
3352,I wish it were not so. I feel jealousy is a bad attitude. 
3353,"I do yoga at home, usually.  I don't really have time too much for classes.  How about you?"
3353,i start off the day with some yoga and then a short run .
3353,"I tried to start running with my son a few months ago, but I could barely keep up with him. "
3353,"if you have a dog , it would help you both out ! you can walk slow too ."
3353,"We have a golden lab, but he's about 14 right now, so he has no interest in running. haha"
3353,I can see that. Definitely need to find a way to pace yourselves.
3353,Maybe I can start a program to build up my ability.  Do you have any recommendations? 
3353,"If you can, find somewhere you can do exercise in a pool. It helps build up resistance and low impact."
3353,"A pool would be a great idea, if I could find one open all night!  Do you know of any gym with that option? "
3353,I am thinking you could probably google it and see somewhere local.
3353,That's a good idea.  I bet I could find something there.
3353,Sounds like a great idea. Hope you find something that works.
3354,how fun. do you take your dog with you?
3354,I have taken him since the begining of the year.
3354,that's nice. i like cats more than dogs but i can't take my cat to the park.
3354,Yes I love cats too they are easier to take care of then dogs as well.
3354,i do take my cat to my weekly book club meeting as my friend who hosts it allows me to.
3354,Nice hobby I read to my little girl so often I don't have time to read my own stuff. 
3354,reading is so great. it is even better when you can share it with others.
3354,Yeah I do like to read books my friends recommend then talk about them.
3354,"i love that, too. what's a great book you could recommend?"
3354,mine is lie down with lions by ken follet
3354,i have not read that. i will look it up today!
3354,It is a very good read it is a novel.
3355,Oh ok.  You are really missing out.
3355,I just love reading books and watching sci fi movies. How about you?
3355,I do like books but don't have much time for them.  What's your favorite sci fi movie?
3355,"I like star wars movies, what is your favorite book?"
3355,I really enjoyed the book The River 
3355,"I read the book The River not to long ago, how is the weather today?"
3355,it is quite rainy.  how is yours?
3355,Its sunny with a high of 85. What part of the country are you in?
3355,I'm in Georgia.  you?
3355,"Texas, has it ever snowed in Georgia?"
3355,"yes, we get snow pretty much every winter in the north of the state"
3356,Oh yeah? How old is he?
3356,"he's 64, and skinny"
3356,Has he ever met Robert Deniro? He is my favorite.
3356,He has! he thinks he's a jerk.
3356,Really? That's a shame. I hate to hear tha.
3356,there are a lotta jerks in hollywood.
3356,I can imagine. I think it's the heat. I love the cold and snow.
3356,"well, i'm old enough to dislike the cold. makes my bones ache."
3356,Sorry to hear that. Where do you live?
3356,"I used to live in michigan, now in kentucky. I know cold."
3356,Yeah not much better in terms of cold I would guess.
3356,"it's a little warmer here, not by much, though."
3357,What worries me is the local farms. I love going to the farmers markets every weekend and you get to know some of the farmers pretty well.
3357,Yes.  Not to mention the animals.  I worry about them too.
3357,Exactly. I always wonder if they understand what's happening. They seem to.
3357,They can definitely become distressed.  I sometimes feature animals on my blog.
3357,That sounds interesting. What is your blog normally about?
3357,"Just sort of a lifestyle blog.  Focuses on kind of ""country"" outdoorsy stuff.  "
3357,"I would enjoy it. I'm not particularly athletic, but I like nothing better than a long walk in the woods."
3357,"I'm not really that athletic either, since having kids.  I did cheerlead in highschool though."
3357,That's pretty athletic! How many kids do you have?
3357,"We have four girls!  They are great kids, but take it ALL out of me.  You have kids?"
3357,"Step-children. My husband has three kids. Their mom passed away, so I try my best to fill her shoes."
3357,Good for you.  Boys?  Girls?
3357,Nice talking to you. Have a great day!
3358,Yeah 400 on plasma
3358,How many times to you donate per month?  
3358,about twice or so 
3358,"I have recently gotten a great opportunity at a tech company, but I have five children. "
3358,Do you take care of them by your lonely 
3358,"Well, my husband stays home and takes care of the youngest two.  The others are in school"
3358,So what do you do?
3358,I'm currently interning at a tech company.  I have a computer science degree.  Trying to get my foot in the door.
3358,"Oh that's a good thing, I wish you all the success in your career."
3358,It's tough having five kids.  Money is soooo tight right now.  What about you?
3358,"I'm full time student, i can relate to that cause i barely have time to enjoy life during during semesters "
3358,"Yeah.  I wonder like, when will I ever get to just have some time of my own?  I guess that's what retirement's for.  Haha"
3359,I met Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman at a Comicon convention once
3359,"i met ryan reynolds he was amazing. I met him when I was hiking on the Appalachian trail, my favorite!"
3359,That sounds amazing. Do you hike often?
3359,As often as I can. I don't get to enough. It's hard to get away from work. I also do Spartan racing! AROO!
3359,Wow that's so cool. It takes an insane amount of dedication just to be in shape for those things.
3359,It is impressive. For most people. But honestly it just takes a lot of heart. I'm like pocket sized and I can do it!
3359,So you are very physically active? I wish I was. My area is super rural and nothing of interest within an hour drive
3359,"Definitely. I do 15 burpees when I get out of bed. I do kettlebell, go to the gym and listen to Joe Rogan the whole time."
3359,"That's dedication I've been trying to workout every  day, but it's hard at first "
3359,"Yeah, it can be monotonous. I believe in you! if you need motivation @YoDabbaDab on the Twitter. You can do anything you can visualize. LOA!"
3359,"haha thanks. Is that your twitter? I don't use that site, but I have an insta if you want to direct me to an account there for inspiration"
3359,I do indeed! I'm alpacabigbowl on IG. I believe in helping others. Honestly just make working out a habit in baby steps
3359,"That's awesome. Anyway, I'm going to go now. It was great talking to you! I'll make sure to follow you on insta"
3360,"what are you studying? do you work, too?"
3360,"engineering, and I'm a delivery driver."
3360,ah. that's great! i got a degree years ago in sociology. not very scientific.
3360,what do you do now?
3360,i'm a state trooper for the state of michigan. been doing that for about 8 years now.
3360,That's great! I'm impressed.
3360,my father was a trooper so i just sort of followed in his footsteps. i actually wanted to be a baker. ha!
3360,"those are slightly different fields, right? heh"
3360,completely. but i love to bake. my favorite dessert to make is chocolate cake with extra frosting.
3360,"guess I'm a stick in the mud, my fav is apple pie."
3360,"that is delicious, too. i make apple pies for my fellow state troopers when it's apple season."
3360,bet they love that!
3361,I see! It would definitely take some work for me to make sure I'm getting the right amount of nutrients.
3361,"Which nutrients do you think are lacking? The only one I can think of is B12, and that's necessary for vegans not vegetarians."
3361,I think since I love pork so much I would just have to make sure I was getting enough protein.
3361,"Seeds, legumes, and nuts are great for protein!  Also, if you plan your diet well, you can reduce the risk of diseases such as heart disease!"
3361,Well it sounds to me like I need to try it out! My sister has been a vegetarian for almost 10 years and loves it.
3361,"Yes! When you start as a vegetarian, make sure you read the labels of packaged cookies, cakes and candies very carefully! These items often contain unfamiliar animal ingredients!"
3361,I've heard about stuff like that! It's insane the amount of ingredients that are in unhealthy processed foods like that.
3361,"Yes, it makes it hard to keep a balanced lifestyle ."
3361,Absolutely. So are you into nutrition and dietetics? 
3361,I'm self taught actually. It is still a learning experience for me.
3361,"Oh, that's awesome! I love teaching myself new things. I'm currently re-teaching my self Spanish."
3361,Spanish is a great language to learn. It is not hard once you learn the verb rules.
3362,How can you not love tacos? So much can be done with them.
3362,"I agree, they're a little heavy for me. I like to swim and they weigh me down."
3362,I can see that. I am worried about drowning when I swim so I try not to think about it.
3362,My mother was like that. She had a major phobia about swimming. We never went to the beach for vacation.
3362,She is like me. Sometimes I wonder if people think I am crazy.
3362,Better to be cautious than to think you're indestructible. 
3362,Thats what I say. Just hope I am not taking it too far.
3362,I live near the beach. We're always hearing stories of people having to be rescued because they overestimated their abilities.
3362,That would make me more worried. I would try to avoid thinking about that.
3362,I have enough of my mother in me that I worry about the tourists all the time. What do you do for fun?
3362,I like to play games of all types. Especially board games.
3362,"Me too! Unfortunately, my husband hates board games. Have you ever played HuggerMugger?"
3363,I haven't either.  Sounds kinda gross
3363,for how long have you been a afan
3363,A fan of what?
3363,is tofu your favorite snack food 
3363,"Oh - no, remember, I've never tried it.  Sounds gross.  I like potato chips"
3363,yeah we like them too what else do you eat
3363,I also like apples
3363,pretty good we do more mangoes than apples what about oranges in your place
3363,No one in my family likes oranges.  Don't like the consistency
3363,ok apart from that we do corns 
3363,"Yes, we like corn on the cob"
3363,corn dogs are yummy. where do you get yours from?
3364,Do you like to work there? Is it difficult to joggle school and work? 
3364,Yes I like work there. The pay is reasonable. I'm able to joggle work and school because I go to work only 4 times during the week. 
3364,What do you study? 
3364,I study Finance. 
3364,You must be vary good with numbers?
3364,Yes. I absolutely love mathematics. Such an awesome field. 
3365,it was hard at first but got easier as time went on

3366,im already making breakfast for my five kids let alone the adult children!!
3366,You're such a good mom! I really admire the way you take care of your family. I wish I could be more like you. 
3366,aww thank you so much im sure you just as kind really!! 
3366,"Oh thank you for saying that! How are your children, by the way? Are they doing well in school?"
3366,yes they are doing great thanks ! 2 are in junior school and 3 are progressing through high. do you have kids?
3366,"Yes, I am raising 9 children. 4 are mine from my first husband, and 5 are from my current husband. "
3367,What are some of your favorite songs to play on the guitar?

3367,What are some things you like to do besides playing instruments?

3367,"Mario odyssey, Zelda etc. What do you like to do when you have some free time?"
3367,"I really love to travel, especially to get out of the local cold winters"
3367,"I agree, I don't like winters"
3367,"I grew up by the Atlantic ocean, but now live in frigid Minnesota."
3367,"Omg, that's brutal"
3367,"I miss the ocean, I am a huge fan of lighthouses"
3368,It is some type of bulldog.
3368,"I think you try to continue talking to him, until dialogue isn't an option"
3368,"Yeah, I think I will drop some hints during our net conversation."
3368,"Just make sure you drop the hint in a nice way! You seem kind anyways. I'd accidentally knock a volleyball, my fav sport btw into his yard"
3368,Volleyball is fun. I spend my free time going rock climbing.
3368,That's cool that you rock climb! Indoor or out? you're a badass. Have you seen Maru? I wish the guy was less of an egomaniac.
3369,I want the new photographer job
3369,Well try talking to her again.
3369,I will and I hope I get it
3369,Relax and be yourself!  Since I love to laugh that can break the ice too!
3369,Should open up with a joke
3369,You could always try Russian Political jokes? Those seem to be in style these days.
3369,I'll play it safe and go with knock knock
3369,There you go. Sounds like fun.  But even though I love flip flops I would not wear them for this.
3369,You don't wear those shoes to an interview
3369,I hate interviews the most.  Always the most stressful part.
3369,Always sweat and stutter
3369,Just take some deep breaths before hand and think happy thoughts.
3370,I did beat him but barely
3370,if you saw me play tennis you would laugh alot .
3370,I'm not that great but not the worst
3370,I am sure you are good at many other things though.
3370,I'm good at failing
3370,Well at least you're good at something but I bet you have your fair share of victories too.
3370,I'll practice the game some more later
3370,I bet you win every now and then too.
3370,I do and hope you win at something
3370,Mostly when I compete against my sister.
3370,I'm sure you win sometimes
3370,"yes but whenever i play , someone always screws up ."
3371,"No, she actually lives next door!"

3371,Yeah it is not so bad in the later months of the year
3372,"I realize that Magic Mike is my favorite movie, but as a guy I wouldnt feel comfortable going to a ""male review"""
3372,"Yea, I dont think I would either"
3372,You don't think that some of your girlfriends would enjoy it as a night out?
3372,"Maybe, I never thought to ask"
3372,"You know what, if you need somebody to go with you, I'll go. Who knows, maybe I'll meet a girl. haha"
3372,"You never know, it could happen"
3372,"And it's probably better than playing Madden on Xbox all night, which is what I had planned. "
3372,Playing xbox sounds like a good time to me
3372,"Plus, I get to laugh at you trying to slip a dollar into some dude's g-string"
3372,That might be pretty interesting 
3372,I feel like it would make you nervous and I like watching you squirm

3373,"Ha, I wish my dogs did a better job of listening."
3373,yeah takes time but treats alwas seem to do the trick ahah 
3373,Luckily my dogs aren't too noisy. If they were I'd never get a chance to enjoy music.
3373,aww yeah thats good point ! im used to loud noises as im a lumberjack! whats you fav genre?
3373,I like instrumental music best. I am not a very good singer.
3373,oh thats interesting most people who like instrumentals tend to sing along or rap 
3373,I usually just hum a reference note instead.
3373,ok fair enough do you play any instruments?
3373,"Yeah, that's the big reason the singing gets distracting"
3373,what do you play?

3374,"I've thought about it many times, but I keep coming to the same conclusion. I'm too busy. Do you own dogs?"

3374,I actually love reading! What's your favorite book?
3374,I love Stephen King's the Stand.  Whats yours?

3375,Not lately but when I was younger it happened when I didn't always realize how much money I had with me-now I use my debit card
3375,Wow that's cool. I never learned how to drive
3375,How do you get around without driving?

3375,I'm an accountant

3376,Yeah but I feel like I cant undo the pain
3376,There's no way to. Just have to remember the good times. I could always take you out for drinks.
3376,yeah that could be fun especially if there is a football game on
3376,"I've got some in the fridge, want to come over and watch a game?"
3376,Yeah that would be swell! What time?
3376,whenever you get here will be fine. Are you sure that your boyfriend won't get jealous?
3376,We broke up actually
3376,"That stinks. Well, yeah. Just come on over and I'll grill out. You can stay if you drink too much"

3378,Have you watched anything good on TV lately?
3378,No I am so busy working at the Gas Station and preparing to move. 
3378,"nice, moving is never fun. The packing/unpacking part at least."
3378,Yeah it has been a mess lately. Are you working?
3378,"yes, I nanny a special needs child. i love my job."
3378,That sounds very rewarding. How many hours a day?
3378,"12 hours, 5/6 days a week. i stay tired."
3378,You need a foot massage. I make my husband rub mine after work

3380,"Lol. I do a lot of the times. I run to another room. I know it's bad, but I can't help it."
3380,"I can understand that, anytime I smell or see vomit I want to vomit too."

3380,Are you looking at colleges yet?
3380,"Not yet, but I can't wait to graduate and start working."
3380,Enjoy your freedom for a bit. You are lucky you don't have a lot of responsibilities right now. 
3380,"I'm with you. Sometimes responsibilities get too overwhelming and you feel like you have to hide from them. At some point though, I'm sure you and I will improve."
3381,A fam?
3381,A baseball fam is an account for baseball content written by real players.
3381,I've never heard of that but I mostly play for recreation.
3381,"When I was a child, I worked and baseball fam helped."
3381,How did it help. Is this something I should look into?
3381,Placing bets on the game helped me earn extra money to by meat at the store. Yes look into it.
3381,Because of the history I don't like to mix gambling and baseball.
3381,"I do not blame you. In any case, the extra money helped me survive. Survival is top priority."
3381,For sure. Fortunately my survival doesn't depend on gambling but you have to what you have to do.
3381,That is good to hear. You can also use baseball fam to just listen to podcasts.
3381,I like podcasts I listen to them when I am between classes.
3381,"Podcasts are a great option for breaks and, of course, baseball is a great topic."
3382,Because you guys tend to act a certain way
3382,"Who do you mean, you guys? I thought the tv debate made you angry."
3382,all of you are one when i watch the parliment
3382,Alright then. Maybe we should change the subject to something that does not make you angry.
3382,what will that be then?
3382,"What do you do for a living? I am an art teacher, I teach at the local high school."
3382,i am a tax preporator 
3382,"Well that sounds rather dull, actually. What do you like to do while not preparing taxes?"
3382,i don't like this conversation
3382,Oh. I'm sorry that you are so easily upset. Do you enjoy preparing taxes?
3382,yes only thing i care about
3382,"I imagine since you like it so well you're rather good at it, then. "
3383,My favorite pizza is plain cheese what about you?
3383,I like bbq chicken pizza. It has bbq sauce instead of tomato sauce with grilled chicken on top
3383,Ooh sounds good. Im not a huge fan of pizza sauce I actually prefer olive oil!
3383,Oh ok. That's saounds different. I'll have to try it!
3383,Yeah I'm Greek so I may be biased

3384,"speaking of tina fey, her best show was 30 rock.  have you seen it?"
3384,"I haven't, but I do like Alec Baldwin. He was on there, right?"
3384,yes!  He is.  He's the best.  he plays a ladies man.  I wish I was like him.  I've never kissed a girl
3384,Really? How old are you?
3384,i am in my twenties . you ?
3384,"I'm in my twenties, too. My family runs a grocery store and I help out during the week."
3384,"cool, do you get free food?"
3384,Lol...I wish. I have to actually pay full price!
3384,"wow, thats crazy.  Do you ever shop somewhere else out of spite?"
3384,"No, not for spite. We are just a grocery store, though. But I can get pop-tarts cheaper at Target!"
3384,Cool!  I find that Walmart is always the cheapest.  Do you shop there?
3385,Yeah you are
3385,That is such a great age. I remember it well!
3385,I know it is 
3385,"What else is she doing right now, how is her speech?"
3385,It was good 
3385,I remember when my son walked for the first time. It was epic.
3385,I don't what else to say lmaoo 
3385,"Listen, I know you're laughing out loud. ADHD is no laughing matter I'll have you know."
3385,Okay I guess lol
3385,What a fun chat this is. Do you gave any other child related facts? Aren't toys expensive?
3385,I don't even have a child yet
3385,Hasn't your son just taken his first steps? Nevermind then. Enjoy the rest of your day!
3386,You travel during the summer? Where do yo uwork?
3386,"Yes I travelled. I just graduated form high school, so I am not working yet. How about you?"
3386,"I'm permanently disabled, I'm afraid. But I'd love to be able to visit other places. What kind of job are you looking for?"
3386,Sorry to hear that. Was it an accident or a gene thing? I would like to get something simple until I go to school retail. 
3386,"It's a bit of both. Genetic predisposition, triggered by an accident. What's ""school retail?"""
3386,"OK. No, I am planning to start university, and while I am in school, I will probably work some retail job."
3386,"Oh, I understand. What are you going to study in university?"
3386,"I a not sure yet. I want to get there and take some general classes and then figure it out. However, I want to travel during the summers!"
3386,"Hahah, you should enjoy summers off while you can. You don't get those anymore when you enter the workforce."
3386,"Yeah I know! And summer is my favorite. Being disabled, what do you do during the summer?"
3386,"The same thing I do the rest of the year. Try to find a job I can work, talk to my friends, take care of my cat."
3386,I love cats! Are you working right now? What is your area / field?
3387,"Yeah, I decided that I would get a new hobby involving race horses"
3387,A hobby like racing them? Or gambling on them?
3387,I'd like to race them - I already bought 3 race horses and have plans to buy 7 more
3387,Oh wow. They are beautiful animals. Would you ride them yourself or have a jockey do that part?
3387,"I haven't decided yet.  For the past few years I've been a professional horse racing handicapper, but have decided to change things up a bit"
3387,"I like sports, but I've never been to a horse race before. I imagine it's very entertaining."
3387,It's a lot of fun!  I think I might try racing them myself and see how it goes!
3387,"You sound quite passionate about it, so I'm sure if you put your mind to it you will do great!"
3387,Thanks!  My friend is a jockey so I'm sure he'll give me some tips on how to do well!
3387,I bet you really have to keep an eye on your physique to be a jockey! 
3387,It helps that I'm short and have a tiny build - perfect for a jockey
3387,That does sound perfect! Everything is lining up for you to have great success. I wish you the best of luck!
3388,Almost two years.
3388,"Wow, that's really difficult. Why did she say she wanted to leave?"
3388,my girlfriend tells me she's going to leave me almost every day 
3388,That doesn't sound healthy. You should talk to her about that or maybe consider breaking up with her.
3388,"Yeah it's whatever, I enjoy John Gresham Movies, but not his books."
3388,Oh i know nothing about his books or movies. What makes you like them?
3388,Because some of the books moral i can relate to them 
3389,Do you know a lot about Sinatra?
3389,"Yes, I listen to documentaries about Sinatra when I go for runs."
3389,"That's cool. He was a little before my time. So, I only know bits and pieces about but I wish I could sing like him."
3389,Try mimicking his singing style while at work. I'm a veterinarian and I find singing like Sinatra calms the animals.
3389,I'll try that. Singing it kind of an outlet for me.
3389,Me too. Running and singing are my outlets and they help me to relax. What else do you do to relax?
3389,My girlfriend and I like to go hiking when the weather is nice.
3389,Hiking is nice. Do you have any pets?
3389,A yellow lab named Scooter.
3389,"Labs are such cute dogs. If you ever need someone to check your dog out, bring him by my veterinarian office."
3389,"He's a little shy and can get a little anxious around new people. So, I think I better keep taking him to my vet but thanks for the offer."
3389,"You're welcome. Running is a great way to ease anxiety, even for dogs!"
3390,Yeah. It's good to see him starting to gain popularity
3390,"Yes definitely! In 2015, he released his fourth album Views, and broke several chart records in 2016!"
3390,That's awesome! And you went to school with the dude?
3390,yeah we were in most of the same classes and we sill kep in touch ! 
3390,that's cool as hell. I know that he hangs with a lot of people that I used to know before I left for the Army
3390,oh that sounds a look more interesting than my marketing job! 
3390,It keeps me on my toes. Thats for sure. You still dating that same girl?
3390,yeah stil going strong. what about you?
3390,Nah. It's hard to find somebody when you spend 90 percent of your time in the sand
3390,Yeah well you will find someone one day. Just be patient!
3390,"Yeah, well, I prefer random hookups for now. Speaking of, how's your girl's sister doing? LOL"
3390,LOL yeah she is fine thanks
3390,"Man! When I saw her last summer at the pool, she was really filling that swimsuit out. "
3391,"Yeah, my strongest subject is math. What´s your´s?"
3391,I am terrible at math
3391,"Whast subject do you like? I also like animals, dogs to be exact!"
3391,I like te paranormal
3391,"Interesting, I could go for paranormal dogs! Then I would not have to leave them at home when I visit my very allergic mother."
3391,lol
3391,"Yeah, she is so allergic that I have to leave my (real) dogs at home when I visit. "
3391,"I'm thankfully not allergic to either, how old are your dogs?"
3391,Figs is 7 and Ben is 2. Do you have pets?
3391,i used to have 2 cats but they passed away
3391,"I am so sorry. How long ago? I love cats too but my dogs won´t let me have any,"
3391,one passed in 2017 and one last year 2 days after my borthday
3391,What were their names?
3392,"I would love to make a cake, is that something you would help me with?"
3392,"I mean, there's not a lot I can do to help you from here, but I can probably give you some advice at least."
3392,"That would be nice, I'm gonna get started.. What would your first bit of advice be?"
3392,"Before you start cooking, or do anything you can't get back, make sure you have all your ingredients and tools ready."
3392,That's great advice.. I'll do that right now and get started!
3392,"You can go with homemade frosting if you want. It's a lot of work, but in my opinion it's totally worth it."
3392,Homemade frosting is my favorite as well.. Do you know anything about making it the best way possible?
3392,"There's a difference between regular and confectioner's sugar. You need confectioner's sugar, not just any old sugar will do!"
3392,Excellent.. I'll be sure to take note of all of this.. I can't wait to do this!!
3392,"Awesome, good luck! Remember, icing is sugar, butter, milk and flavouring."
3392,"I got it all! I love cooking so much, and you just made it so much better!"
3392,"That's great! Once you get more experience, I suggest expanding to buttercream icing, but for now, KISS (""Keep It Simple, Stupid!"")"
3393,That's true! Butterfly seems much harder than backstroke
3393,just gotta be careful where you swim
3393,The ocean definitely scares me. I prefer lakes
3393,I'm always scared of the undertow
3393,Is that the same thing as riptides?
3393,im not sure lol
3393,"Haha me neither. Either way, the ocean is scary. Have you been swimming any time recently?"
3393,not in a while. jellyfish freak me out too
3393,I got stung by like five jellyfish this past summer
3393,omg!  aren't they really poisonous?
3393,Some of them are harmless haha. It just stings for a while 
3393,i freak out when I see a dead one on the beach lol
3394,Oh neat! I love alt rock so I was always interested in guitars
3394,"well there are different types of guitars, of course electric, acustic, but there are also classical guitars, and steel-string guitar"
3394,I got to play around with one at the craft store i work at before
3394,I have played for many years. I bought my first one when I was a teenager. I own 9 now.
3394,Thats alot! What kind would you recommend for a beginner like me? 
3394,Well my personal favorite is Acoustic guitars.  The transmit sound by vibrating the strings and do not use electronic amps
3394,Ill look into getting one of those then!
3394,"You definitely should, they are a great system to own, I LOVE mine"
3394,Yeah Thanks for the advice! Do you play anything else?
3394,"Yes ,  I learned piano at age 6 and still play some today."
3394,thats impressive! Do you own a piano?
3394,"No, but I still play occasionally.  "
3395,"Yes, you need to keep prepared.  I do like to swim, do you?"
3395,Yeah I love swimming. Especially in summer when the water is warm.
3395,Are you a good swimmer?
3395,Yeah not bad. It comes in handy. I had an incident the other day that scared the life out of me.
3395,"Oh my, what happened?"
3395,My cat fell in the swimming pool and I had to jump in to save it. It couldn't get out!
3395,"That is very scary, It's good you were there to help.  I love animals.  How many pets do you have?"
3395,Just one cat.....well nearly no cats as it happens! Have you got any pets yourself?
3395,I have two cats and 4 little dogs.  What hobbies do you enjoy
3395,I like to play poker with friends and also cycling. I love to go out for a ride at the weekend.
3395,"Sounds fun.  I enjoy hiking.  I'd like to learn to play poker, is it difficult to learn?"
3395,It depends what kind you play. It's pretty easy to pick up to be honest. Even now through I forget the rules sometimes. You should give it a try.
3396,My mother was a teacher. What did you teach?
3396,math
3396,Do you know a lot about math?
3396,I know that Mathematicians seek out patterns and use them to form conjectures
3396,Do math teachers do that too?
3396,I believe they do.
3396,I thought you were one? Shouldn't you know? Hahah.
3396,im retired now god knows what these kids do with the stucture of their lessons! 
3396,"Hahah, fair enough. When did you retire?"
3396,11 years ago. Which is both good and bad! Lucky I haven't suffered any recession effects.
3396,"Ah, you had a solid retirement plan, I assume? Good to hear."
3396,"Oh yeah, I've planned extensively for when I will stop employment. are you ready yourself? "
3397,bears do like to raid my beets lol
3397,That must be an interesting experience! I live in the city so I have never seen a real bear other than at the zoo!
3397,i've heard they raid trash in towns around denver. but I live on a beet farm
3397,I didn't realize there were entire farms dedicated to growing beets. Have you always done that?
3397,"yes family farm. we grow sugar beets, not the regular vegetable kind"
3397,I didn't know there were different kinds of beets. Apparently I am missing out on some things by being an introverted city person!
3397,"lol big world out there. it's hard work and boring, but i'm my own boss."
3397,I would love to be my own boss! The corporate grind is really tiring sometimes. 
3397,my sister has a corp job. hates it. Me? I'd go nuts out here without Netflix and battsestar galactica reruns
3397,I'm such an introvert I don't get out much other than to work. I think it sounds perfect.
3397,i think the only thing i miss out here are ethnic restaurants. i envy you that
3397,We do have some great food in the city! The local shops around here are fantastic as well.
3398,"I was there when I was in the army, did like a weekend getaway think. Have you served?"
3398,I served in Desert Shield way back when
3398,"Wow, me too. What did you think? You come out OK."
3398,"For the most part. I made it back with all my parts, which is more than some guys I was with"
3398,"Good to hear. Yeah. I know. I was so impacted by the death and injury, essentially caused by / for oil, I got back and got a Prius!"
3398,I don't blame you. Prius don't make a farm tractor or I would have one. 
3398,"Yeah, not yet at least! So you farm? I work in IT."
3398,Yes sir. Got me a cattle farm up here
3398,Sounds relaxing (but yet also difficult). You must get outdoors a lot! I am lucky to see the sun through my office window.
3398,"Yeah. It's nice to enjoy nature, but in the winters I would LOVE to have sun through an office window."
3398,"Winters can be tough I bet...nothing like the heat in Desert Shield though. Man that was rough, unbearable."
3398,That's the only place I've ever been when it was too hot to smoke. LOL
3398,"Yeah, to hot to do anything really!"
3399,Very bad
3399,It didn't use to be a problem. My doctor thinks it's a reaction to some of the meds I'm on.
3399,My father owns a store
3399,What type of store does he own?
3399,A retail store kinda like seven eleven 
3399,I used to love going to seven eleven when I was a kid and getting king sized candy and gallon sized sodas.
3399,His store is having a lot of success but i don't want to inherit it 
3399,Why not?
3399,Because i want to build my own and have my own
3399,If you inherit you could have two and start your own little empire. I know I look back on certain things and wonder if there was more I could do.
3399,I will consider that 
3399,Be the biggest boss you can be.
3400,its warm for October tonight
3400,Yeah it is. I've just got back from the store....it was an interesting trip
3400,what happened?
3400,Well I ended up getting almost all of my groceries for free....
3400,lucky you
3400,Not luck. Coupons. I'm obsessed with collecting and using them. I just got so much pasta I don't know what to do with it!
3400,LOL Ive never been a big coupon clipper
3400,Well the one thing I'd advise is you need a LOT of storage space. My garage is full of well organised food LOL
3400,that i dont have lol we'd be tripping on food
3400,Put it this way if I had a garage sale it would be like going to the supermarket!
3400,lol
3400,I know. I think I have a problem. I see a deal and then wham.....60 packs of pasta!
3401,of course i do. living in montreal its almost impossible to do anything with out knowing french. 
3401,I wasn't in Montreal myself. And I don't speak French. I'd love to visit though.
3402,my parents are very strict on my personal development. no more than 30 min of tv and atleast 2 books a month
3402,I believe they are looking out for your best interests. Developing the skills needed for personal development require a lot of attention.
3402,yeah but i also wish i was old enough to just move out and be on my own
3402,"Savor your years as a dependent, trust me. It can get harder. I just graduated college and have been trying hard to get into basketball overseas."
3402,"I wish I had what you have going! that sounds fun, and congratulations. my dad is more focused on academics"
3402,Thank you. Academics are a great way to get you where you want to be. The world'
3402,yeah. sometimes i feel my dad doesnt get the balance between development and having some fun. im def not a nerd
3402,"Perhaps your dad is also still learning, too. He may be your leader, but he can also learn from you."
3402,"good thought. i for sure feel he cares, just strict ya know? "
3402,If my parents were more strict I think I would have been better. What is your favorite subject?
3402,better in what way? my fav class right now (im in HS) is chemistry. i like it because it seems to come easier than history or spanish
3402,"I would be better at studying, but i am only good at basketball. Chemistry sounds interesting."
3403,How long ago did she pass away?
3403,both passed away in 2001
3403,"That's sad. Sorry, I misread the question at first. Did they die at the same time or did it just happen to be within the same year?"
3403,They died in the same year. There was a slaver raid in the town we lived in Somalia. 
3403,"A slaver raid?? Wow, I didn't know things like still happened!"
3403,"yes they do in some places, mostly in Africa. I was a slave for 10 years until i escaped to egypt and then to the USA."
3403,You speak very fluent English. What was it like being a slave?
3403,Thank you. I worked hard for years on my education in the USA. Being a slave is like forgetting you are a person.
3403,Did you have help escaping?
3403,Thank you. I worked hard for years on my education in the USA. Being a slave is like forgetting you are a person.
3403,Pardon?
3403,"I escaped to Egypt on my own, but I had help there and in coming to the USA."
3404,That's cool. Do you like music?
3404,"yes , i love music ! what about you ? any favorites ?"
3404,Yes i love classic rock and play some guitar. I also enjoy going bowling/
3404,"Wicked, brother! Classic rock is another classic, yes, indeed! What's your favorite classic rock artists? I sure love artists!"
3404,My favorite is the Allman Brothers Band or the Grateful Dead. How about you?
3404,i love the stones . been on a bit of a talking heads binge lately .
3404,Thats cool I recently saw the Rolling Stones in Jacksonville with my family. Great show.
3404,Awesome! They play some good music!
3404,What do you do for a profession?
3404,i work at a retail store . i love going to concerts ! music rocks .
3404,Nice. I completely agree. Definitely see some of the older bands while you still can!
3404,"Yes, I have seen the Who on their farewell tour four times now - lol"
3405,It would be. The overdraft fees today are crazy. I had a friend who was short 10 cents and had to pay a $35 fee.
3405,Fees are always annoying.
3405,They really are. I try my best to balance my checkbook every month. Do you have a savings account?
3405,"I do, and that makes all the difference."
3405,I agree. It's important to start saving even when you are young. I started when I was in my twenties.
3405,You definitely should. Saving should be a very important habit for every individual. You never know what could happen in life
3405,"Right? It could be car trouble, house repairs, or anything really. Investing is another good way to stay financially stable."
3405,"Or just use them for a hobby, like I do for my dance lessons."
3405,Dance lessons? What type of dancing do you practice?
3405,"Tango, I go with my boyfriend also and we practice together."
3405,"Tango is a pretty difficult dance to learn is it not? Outside of dancing at parties, I've never had any formal training for it."
3405,"Yes, it is indeed. But it was definitely worth it, it helped me drop down to a size 12."
3406,What do you like eating 
3406,im addicted to sushi
3406,I like sushi too 
3406,spicy tuna is heaven
3406,"I like spicy food to, i always get buffalo wings with volcano sauce."
3406,i cant do spicy foods
3406,I can't eat it if it's not spicy 
3406,lol spicy tuna roll is about as spicy as I get with food
3406,Oh really. Do you like traveling 
3406,I wish I had the money to travel more.
3406,Yeah Money is a thing 
3406,Yup I would love to see Morocco
3407,I am working at home as a ESL tutor tutoring Polish students living in Poland.
3407,Wow! That's very far from me. I'm a fisherman in the States.
3407,"Okay, where do you fish? Pacific, Atlantic, Golf Coast, Red seas, Alaskan?"
3407,"Atlantic coast, Cape Hatteras."
3407,"Oh wow, I was just looking for a getaway up or down to the Outer Banks. I have never been there but thought to go  and take a chance."
3407,I would recommend the trip. Outer Banks is one of the most popular beaches along the atlantic.
3407,"OH, I had also  planned going to Myrtle Beach. Not to sure about either since I heard in December, Hurricane may be approaching."
3407,Not to worry about in December. You'll have a great time!
3407,"Okay, that's so great to hear. I first thought of Virginia Beach but thought it would be too cool for the outdoors."
3407,"That's actually correct if you're planning for December. The other locations will be fine, the ocean may be chilly but the air temperature won't be bad."
3407,"Hey, what kind of fish you catch on the Atlantic? I'm always buying wild caught over farm raised."
3407,Cod and Haddock are the most that I'm able to get.
3408,I hope you do as well
3408,What is it in your future that you are so looking forward to these days?
3408,"I also like to read, do you?"
3408,"Yes, I do love a good book. What is your favorite genre?"
3408,"Lately it has been the Bible, you?"
3408,The best book of all time! I have been trying to better at getting back into the Word myself.
3408,"I have not read it all completely through personally, though know the stories. "
3408,It's very difficult to just try to read straight through. I find it helps greatly to have a separate guide to help you along your way.
3408,"Yes, I notice is a lot of audible options on YouTube, so you can follow along, which is really great!"
3408,I have been going to a Wednesday night study group with people who know it inside and out. I have found it very helpful.
3408,"That is wonderful, to have fellowship is important. Sure wishing you all the best!"
3408,Same to you. The future is definitely worth looking forward to!
3409,Do you have any pets?
3409,I have 2 very cute cats that I hold close to my heart dearly! 
3409,"Thats nice, I have two dogs. They are my best friends. "
3409,I have the exact same feeling with my two cats! Only except when they secretly eat the cakes I'm decorating...
3409,"Do you like Neil Tyson Degrasse? I have a huge crush on him, even have his poster on my bedroom wall. "
3409,I'm not that interested in his type. I did read somewhere that he became interested in astronomy after a trip to the Planetarium; funny how things work out like that.
3409,What are your interests/ hobbies?
3409,"Well cakes have also been my thing ever since I was a little kid, decorating wedding cakes pays the bills and sneaking in some icing is also nice!"
3409,"I would love to try one of your cakes, bet they are delicious. I have a bit of a sweet tooth. "
3409,"They are! I know from experience, I would gladly lend you a piece of cake whenever I get the chance!"
3409,Do you have any plans for tonight? 
3409,"I have to take my cats for a walk and finish up one cake, I can give you a piece of one that I've saved up in the fridge!"
3410,yes it was horrible but good thing i have alot of family who was there for me. I have four siblings how about you?
3410,"I have no siblings, but I have three children."
3410,oh thats awesome kids are great i have two of them. My favorite color is blue what about you?
3410,I'm also a fan of blue.
3410,yes love the color. do you travel?
3410,I go down to the conservation area to fish every so often.
3410,oh i love to fish its relaxing.
3410,"Plus, it tastes good, even if it's a bit messy. I think I've got gutting down to a science though."
3410,yes very messy but always turns out great.  what do you do for fun?
3410,"Besides fishing? Well, I'm actually into bow hunting, but my license expired so I haven't done that in a while."
3410,yes besides fishing sorry!  oh that sounds fun also.  I lke hunting as well
3410,"Moose is a fun hunt, but it's a pain to pack out, even if there's six of you."
3411,orchids?  aren't the like flowers?
3411,Yes.  As a child we always called them 
3411,why eat a flower though?
3411,I guess because they are healthy and don't taste that bad.
3411,id rather have vanilla ice cream lol
3411,give me mint choc chip
3411,butter pecan is my favorite
3411,i could go or a waffle cone now lol
3411,whats your fave ice cream ship?
3411,what is an ice cream ship?
3411,"shop, sorry"
3411,ohhhh okay that makes more sense. Friendly's
3411,done
3412,Mine is Korn but Nirvana used to be good for me too.
3412,Yeah It was that whole grunge scene in the 90's that I was into. I was into the baggy clothes and everything. I still dress casual these days!
3412,Man I miss my elephant jeans. Those were wicked!!
3412,"Yeah right! well they say fashion goes full circle so who knows, maybe they will be back!"
3412,"I've been waiting, what, 20 years now. I don't think elephant jeans are coming back. Can you imagine a 30"" wide pant leg? lol"
3412,"LOL, actually no. I don't want to imagine that. Fashion is crazy these days. I'd get some new clothes if I could get out to the mall....."
3412,I've taken my kids to the mall. I want nothing to do with fashion now. It's nuts.
3412,Spray on jeans and 100 dollar t shirts. No thanks. Anyway my cars out of action so I'm going nowhere fast at the moment
3412,i hear ya. What's wrong with your car? 
3412,It's a Dodge with engine problems. It'll cost a fortune to fix.
3412,All depends on what the problem is. There's plenty of side mechanics that'll help you out for a case or two of beer.
3412,I need to find someone who can give it a full overhaul. Maybe 10 kegs will do it LOL
3412,"nah just 1. Buy some spark plugs, oil seals, oil, and spend 4 hours. It'll be fine."
3413,"I have a yellow convertible. Sometimes I drive in the rain, but it leaks."
3413,Does it rain a lot where you are?
3413,not really. but when it pours
3413,Do you live in the United States?
3413,yes. what about you?
3413,"Yes, I do, but I'd love to live abroad at some point."
3413,I love the simple life in the Philippines
3413,Is there a lot of nature scenes to enjoy there?
3413,oh yes. It makes me feel like a breath of fresh air.
3413,That's nice.  I like outdoor activities.
3413,I like to relax and enjoy God's creations.
3413,Did you prefer playing outdoors as a kid as opposed to being inside and watching TV?
3414,I really enjoy spending as much time with my family as possible. Do you have children?
3414,yes i have two children
3414,Wonderful. The are great gifts from the Lord :)
3414,"yes they are , so very sweet"
3414,Do you get to spend the amount of time you would like to with them?
3414,"yes of course, all day!"
3414,"That is wonderful! Mine is grown, so I really can get to missing them."
3414,"Oh, poor you! But once they become full adults things will be easier!"
3414,"Mine are full adults, and busy with their lives. They do come for dinner as least once a week though, thankful for that!!!"
3414,I bet! Does your family do a large dinner as well?
3414,"As much as possible, yes! All the best to you in every way!"
3414,You too! Thanks! I hope you have a wonderful weekend!
3415,We were on the soccer pitch at the time and could really feel it!
3415,"oh wow that sounds scary, I love hiking and spending time outdoors do you as well?"
3415,"Yeah I like keeping active. I love soccer actually, I play it with family, we are in a local team.."
3415,"That sounds like so much fun, I like soccer as well. My favorite sport to play is softball"
3415,"I used to play softball when I was a kid. Well I tried to play, it can be hard when you have three older brothers LOL"
3415,lol I can understand that. Whats your favorite food mines a burrito
3415,"I like Indian food. Curry is my favourite but to be honest as long as it's tasty, I'm in"
3415,I've never tried curry. 
3415,"You should. It's like a whole new experience. Not too hot though, not at first anyway. You might like it."
3415,Sounds like it would be good. 
3415,"Yeah, check out recipes online to get started."
3415,"awesome, I think I will. I love trying new foods and recipes "
3416,"Sounds like something I could use. My father had a heart attack recently, and it has been a stressful week."
3416,"Awe, I'm so sorry to hear this. How have you've been handling all of the stress?"
3416,"I love to play guitar, so I've been playing that some at night."
3416,"I wished I could have learned to play the piano. However, I did learn to play the flute in middle school."
3416,"That's cool! I'm so glad I can play music. It's soothing when I'm stressed, and just pure fun all other times."
3416,The best way I deal with stress is to diffuse it and do something fun and entertaining like reading a book or going out with friends.
3416,"I can't concentrate on reading when I'm stressed, but going out with friends works every time."
3416,You know I actually welcome a little stress in my life. It makes me a stronger person when I can overcome stress. But I do understand stress can't be avoided.
3416,I agree a little is character building. But I think I've built enough character for one week.
3416,Some stressors are unavoidable like a heart attack. or a chronic illness. I'm so sorry you're stress. Get better.
3416,I will. Thanks! I think I'll go have one of those vodka and apple brandy beverages you told me about.
3416,"Yes, I hope you enjoy it. Good night."
3417,do you play any instruments?
3417,Yes I play guitar in a band with friends
3417,That's cool. I used to play bass in a punk band years ago. Do you play shows regularly?
3417,"Nice! And I dont play shows regularly, only sometimes when my bandmates convince me. I'm a self-conscious about my appearance so I dont like to go out much"
3417,"I feel ya. I don't get out much anyway, too busy with work. I tutor english lit. What do you do?"
3417,"Oh that's cool :) I work in a hair salon, currently training a couple of newbies at the job. Do you like being a tutor?"
3417,Yeah it's cool. I'm trying to work my way into SAT prep because the money can be better. 
3417,More money is always better :) My students dyed my hair brown yesterday. Any random facts for you?
3417,I'm currently building my halloween costume as we speak
3417,Oh that sounds fun! What are you going to be?
3417,Remember bill murry in The Life Aquatic? I'm gonna be steve zissou. Do you have a costume?
3417,Lol that's awesome. XD I can't decide between Mary J. Blige or Steve Harvey or a hotdog haha
3418,Guess what my occupation was before this?
3418,I'm going to guess you were a real estate agent.
3418,"That's quite a specific guess, but no, I was a nurse."
3418,Well that's a great career. I'm retired.
3418,How do you enjoy your free time?
3418,"I actually really enjoy helping people, specifically my husband."
3418,That's really sweet of you.
3418,Thank you! I just like being with people.
3418,"Yes, me too, that's why I started working as a nurse."
3418,That makes a lot of sense. Why wrestling?
3418,"I got into it by chance, and I was pretty good at it so I started doing it competitively. Pretty random."
3418,"So, hobby turned career?"
3418,"Yes, pretty much."
3419,ooh! italian pizza! how is it different?
3419,"It's different. Our pizza was invented in Naples, and that's been popular around the world."
3419,dangit! we almost went to naples for a school trip when my wife was a teacher. i could have tried the pizza!
3419,Naples is so beautiful
3419,you have been there?
3419,Yes its so different from here
3419,i can imagine. did you go for vacation or work?
3419,we go once a year on vacation
3419,i envy you. we can't afford it till the kids are grown i think. all those plane tickets!
3419,yeah its expensive to travel overseas
3419,"anywhere with planes, i think. we were going to go to Disneyland one year and couldn't do it because of plane tickets. "
3419,yea everything is expensive now
3420,"My hair is red, maybe my ancestors are from there."
3420,Maybe.  No one in my family has red hair.  
3420,"I have many friends, but I don't recall any with red hair."
3420,I saw a redheaded guy at a restaurant last month.  He had really fair skin.
3420,Yep. Most red heads do. I think I'm just one big freckle though.
3420,"I don't like eating out too much, because people irritate me (even redheads)."
3420,oh. a recluse are you?
3420,"No, not quite.  I prefer my solitude, though.  Do you?"
3420,Not really. I enjoy socializing with my many friends.
3420,That's good.  You must like having parties and stuff then.
3420,Sure do. Love to go. Hate to host.
3420,I see.  What do you do for a living?
3421,yes i love amazon so many different things you can buy. What do you do for a living
3421,and you cant beat free shipping
3421,no you cant if you need something really quick they always deliver free. two day its so awesome
3421,i do like target too though
3421,yes target is nice sometimes pricey.  well what do you do for work?
3421,i work in the shipping department
3421,oh thats cool i do odd jobs here and there babysit uber and clean houses 
3421,"HOw is Uber?  Ive thought about it to make some extra cash but I',m nervous about driving strangers around"
3421,its decent pay i do it parttime its pretty good. 
3421,I might try that..of I was thinking about neing a Door Dasher.  Amazon doesn't pay too much lol
3421,yeah door dash maybe that would be good. what about family do you have any siblings i have three.
3421,just 2 kids
3422,"Woah, that's interesting. Where are they found?"
3422,they eat a lot of crickets and dubia roaches
3422,So they've been around for a very long time and are still here today?
3422,"Yes they are, but I am not sure if they are still here today."
3422,That is very interesting. Do you think they may have come from space?
3422,"Yes, I think so. It may only be at a simple prokaryote level though"
3422,"If it came from space, they may still be living up there on the outside of the space shuttles though."
3422,"Haha that is true, I wonder if they feel like they belong here."
3422,They might. I could definitely see them eating the micro particles on the glass of the International Space Station. 
3422,They must be hungry. I wonder what they are attracted to or what kind of people they are attracted to
3422,"I would assume they are attracted to the ship itself as while it is in space, it is collecting micro dust particles. In the particles, there might be life. "
3422,"The particles can also be biological in origin, isnt that shocking?! I'm not sure who I'm attracted to"
3423,What is your favorite band. Mine is Nirvana!
3423,not really into bands.  i love music and like to dance.  actually have won multiple tap competitions
3423,"OH, WOW! I work at a restaurant and we have a dance floor."
3423,does ur restaurant host dance nights?
3423,"We have different nights.  Two are country and two are rock, the other nights are open mic."
3423,sounds like you work at a fun restaurant. must be always popping in their  
3423,"I love it, but I also go to school part-time."
3423,hard working.  what are you studying
3423,I am a nursing student and you?
3423,wow ... u are very behavior.  tough job.  i work in IT
3423,"Well, I rely on IT in my job. Also, you make no sense."
3423,sorry ... meant brave.... IT is taking over the world.  everything we do involves technology
3424,Were they chocolate cupcakes?
3424,"Yes I believe so.  Even though in the late 1800's, chocolate was just used for drinks primarily, usually not cakes."
3424,I want to be a special education teacher.
3424,"That sounds fun, what maks you want to do that?"
3424,I want to help them learn and become smarter
3424,"That's a worthy endeavor, and a thankless job.  I know a few teachers for the disabled and they are true heroes."
3424,i have to go soon. dinner is almost ready.
3424,What you having for dinner?
3424,Grilled chicken with rice and veggies. You?
3424,OOO that sounds good.  I actually just finished up a LOT of pizza.
3424,What kind of pizza?
3424,"meat lovers, supreme and some deluxe kind.  It's from Joto's if you've ever heard of the place."
3424,oh ok. nice talking to you. goodbye.
3425,Yeah I like cycling so maybe I'll cycle in but Im usually tired in the mornings.
3425,I can spend a lot of money at the shopping mall. I guess you can say I'm a shopaholic.
3425,No way. You must spend a fortune
3425,"yes, I don't like being in debt. But I just can't help it."
3425,Well there's suggestions online of how to get out of debt. I used to spend too much but now I play sports and try to keep fit instead.
3425,Oh that's great. Wished I was where you are. Now I understand people who gamble and get help. Gamblenonymus...I think that's the name.
3425,Well I'm not perfect. I'm still late to go to bed which isn't great when exercising. It's why I'm always tired LOL
3425,"Awe, so sorry to hear this. No one is perfect that's for sure. We all have flaws...lol"
3425,Yeah well shopping excessively isn't exactly bad for your health....just your bank balance!
3425,And shopping comes with stress because I have debt and I keep on adding to it. It's seems a hopeless cause.
3425,Cut up those cards and be done with it. Sell your old stuff online and you'll be okay in time
3425,"Hey, that's good advice, thank you. I'm thinking about calling credit counseling but don't know which one to trust. They want money too."
3426,"dang, thats quite a long time! maybe thats why its a rich persons game too. still, i enjoy it and im poor"
3426,Yes it really is. I am far from rich but like to play occasionally as well. What other things do you enjoy?
3426,I have a little pub named corky. im a dog mom
3426,"How adorable! I don't own any dogs, but wish I had some to play with."
3426,There was this cool business back home that allowed you to rent a puppy! Maybe they haves something like near you
3426,"That's a great idea! I'm surprised I haven't heard of that, I'll definitely have to check that out."
3426,"Do you like other animals? ive actually tried to play tennis with my dog, really its just fetch with a tennis ball"
3426,I like cats as well as dogs. That would be adorable to try tennis with your dog! I like cats because they are pretty independent.
3426,"yeah, i like dogs. for me, they have way more personality. i cant do cats."
3426,I understand. They're not for everyone. I love both for different reasons. It is true that dog's have way more personality though!
3426,My old dog was a pure bread lab and she was quite fun. we called her doofus because was so funny around people
3426,That sounds cute! Labs and shepherds are my favorite. Did you know that labs are called retrievers because of their ability to retrieve shot game undamaged?
3427,Only 2.  Both Dogs
3427,Were you able to find them homes?
3427,"Yes, I was able to place them with friends of another friend."
3427,Well that's good news!
3427,Do you have any pets of your own?
3427,"No, I don't like pets actually. "
3427,To each their own.  Any other particular hobbies to keep you busy?
3427,I obsessed with getting autographs from authors. I'm actually applying for a publisher position as well.
3427,That sounds exciting.  You must be quite the reader...
3427,Always of course. I keep very busy with my career. Anything interesting going on tonight?
3427,Just shuttling children around to sports practice for the next few hours
3427,Having a close family connection sounds amazing. It's just myself here.
3427,It is but can be very time consuming.  Have a great evening.
3428,My mom got to me before I ate it.  She just took it back and put it on the shelf.
3428,Your mom is very discipline.  My parents' form of discipline was putting me in karate class.  have you done karate?
3428,"No, I haven't.  I married my friend from high school and he has black belt in karate."
3428,Cool I have one too!  How come you never tried it?
3428,"I'm not very athletic I guess.  I always wanted to be a writer, but never took a class aimed at becoming published."
3428,cool.  I once wrote a book about shrimp.  What do you write about?
3428,I've always wanted to write a novel about vampires.
3428,cool.  do you like scary stuff?
3428,I do like that stuff.  Do you like ghost stories and such?
3428,I only like stephen king when it comes to horror.
3428,Stephen King is a good writer.  Which book of his do you like best?
3428,I like Salem's Lot.  What about you?
3429,Morocco
3429,I love to travel to Asia. 
3429,Where in Asia?
3429,Philippines. Friendly people and beautiful beaches. Are you married?
3429,yes i am
3429,"I used to be, but since the divorce I live by myself"
3429,oh im sorry
3429,Give me more time to focus on my work as a mechanic. She always said I should marry my cars.
3429,being a mechanic sounds interesting
3429,It sure is. But it's even more difficult now than it used to  be. Everything has a computer chip these days.
3429,yeah my husband used to work on his old mustang no problem. he wouldnt touch a midern car
3429,I would almost kill for a Shelby. Those things can be very pricey.
3430,What games do you like to play in the pool?
3430,Hmm.. I can't say.
3430,"Lol honestly same, I cant even swim so when I'm in the pool there's nothing good happening XD. Do you know how to swim?"
3430,I swim like a rock. I am sort of afraid of water if it isn't the kiddie pool.
3430,"Oh wow, how have you had a bad experience with water that made you afraid? "
3430,"Yes, when I was small I almost drowned once. I should learn to swim however, it's an important skill."
3430,"Oh I'm sorry to hear that, understandable for you to be afraid. It is an important skill, but don't rush. We can stick to ice hockey for nowlol"
3430,ha! I don't even want to go to the pool
3430,"Lol, okay well it works out! Anyways, i gotta ""get going"". I'm leaving in my brand new chevy tahoe! What kind of car do you drive?"
3430,"I don't own a car, I just ride my bike."
3430,"I ride a bike everyday, it's honestly refreshing exercise for me bc you have a built-in fan while you workout :)"
3430,"Yeah, it's great for the body and the mind."
3430,"True words, have a great night!"
3430,Thank you! Same to you!
3431,haha! These subjects are definitely funny.
3431,"I'm watching my favorite movie right now which is ""Gone With The Wind"". Think I'll order a pizza now!"
3431,"Oh no way, that is one of my favorite movies! One of my most favorites is The Ten Commandments."
3431,I love that one too! I can't believe I'm craving pizza so much now. Both of my pet turtles will eat pizza too.
3431,"Oh that is funny and cute. We have a dog, and English pointer, female. Her name is Perditta, Perdi for short."
3431,I bet she would help you eat your pizza when it shows up.
3431,"Oh for sure, she loves pizza! I am not looking forward to winter this year."
3431,Me either. It snowed here last night. I don't like snow. 
3431,"Only way I mostly like snow, is looking at it through my windows! :)"
3431,"Yes, I always said I love snow as long as it's on a postcard!"
3431,"haha, yes! All the best to you, and hope your holidays are great! God bless!"
3431,Thanks! I hope you enjoy your holidays too!
3432,"I don't know, but I was eating my spaghetti and meatballs, and I couldn't even eat it.  And its my favorite food!"
3432,Oh no. That would've completely ruined my lunch break at work. So sorry about that.
3432,Its ok.. I thought it might be me since I can be forgetful.  Thank god it wasn't!  
3432,I'm sure your coworker had a lot on her mind and completely had forgotten about her sandwich.
3432,Maybe....but maybe it wasn't a her?  
3432,"oops, I forgot it might have been a male. DId you ever find out who it was?"
3432,"No, nobody ever fessed up to it. Anything interesting happen to you today?"
3432,"Not really, up in Virginia the weather has finally cooled down and I""m dealing with a nasty cold for three weeks...UGH!"
3432,"same here, we got some cold weather (in TX), and everyone is sick!"
3432,Noooo. I'm from Florida and it's still humid and hot there. 
3432,oh I bet!
3432,"Yes, but i forgot it's probably time for the Texas weather to cool down now. which I'm certain you're happy."
3433,"Gosh I'm not really into any of those, I'm a business major so I don't get to go out huntin or anything too often."
3433,"No worries, we all have our hobbies!"
3433,do you also just like being in the outdoors?
3433,yes. I love the outdoors. I love fishing and hunting
3433,"I'm into camping when i get the chance.  never really hunted, but i get the allure."
3433,Have you ever camped in the national parks?
3433,"yeah, i've been in a bunch of state parks too.  i' also trying to section hike the appalachhian trail with a buddy."
3433,Maybe I can join you guys on the appalachhian trail.
3433,lol well we're going again in march so we'll see!
3433,"oh , cool ! I'll be looking forward to it. "
3433,do you camp in a tent or a hammock?
3433,It's a two night trip in the mountains. We do have cabins so it's not actually camping in the wilderness.
3434,"Yes, they are, everyone gathers up there at the end of the week."
3434,i like the atmosphere in pubs .
3434,Well it depends on the pub and the company to be honest.
3435,yes dissapointing for sure i don't make alot and trying to land a job in a band 
3435,what kind of music do you play?
3435,piano i have been playing since i was small. Do you play anything or have a hobby?

3436,Wow that's amazing!! I work for facebook and I helped developed it. But your awesome
3436,"Wow, Facebook? That's incredible. My parents are in their 80's, so I just like to make sure everyone is okay."
3436,That's very nice of you.I just program computers and stuff. That's easy compared to you. 
3436,I disagree. I'd never be able to understand the coding languages.
3436,It's much easier then caring for someone. 
3436,I guess we will have to agree to disagree. 
3436,I understand. But I think you your amazing!
3436,"Well thank you, I appreciate it."
3436,wonderful ! when you are kind to others you will receive kindness in return .
3436,You're sweet. Do you have a family at home?
3436,"No, it's just me and my husband. My kids are grown and have moved out. "
3437,I would like to pursue a career in something I love instead of just making money to survive.
3437,I know it's hard but you should go for it! Always follow your passions!
3437,Do you like artistic things?  I enjoy painting.
3437,"Painting is not my thing but if you enjoy that, you should go for it."
3437,I started a portrait of a cat recently.  I live on a farm and there are over 20 cats on it.
3437,"I would love to live on a farm, I could move out but she doesn't want me to."
3437,Who doesn't want you to move?
3437,"My mother, i'm helping her out around the house after my dad died."
3437,That's nice of you.  Do you have any hobbies?
3437,I have a LARP group where I am the general of an oris army.
3437,I've never known anyone who was involved in stuff like that.  
3437,"It's a good time, in a way I suppose it is artistic, like your interests."
3438,"I dont, other than i remember it very vividly as i loved barney!"
3438,Did not care for Barney much at all.  I think I was a little too old by that point.  Any other favorite things about it?
3438,"Not really, just the purple dinosaur. but I like purple because of its significance to my country (USA), the purple heart"
3438,That makes sense.  Did you serve in any of the armed forces?
3438,my grandfather did. he was an awesome guy. he didnt talk to much about so he took up professional dog training
3438,"Dog training can be very rewarding, did you take over for him?"
3438,"yes, i really love dogs because of him! We primarily do labs for hunting but we do other breeds as well"
3438,That's pretty cool.  Hunting season is in full swing here.  Those labs seem to love to hunt.  Sooo much energy to start.
3438,"yeah they are good dogs. actually speaking of purple and dogs, my yellow lab is going to be given some purple dye for halloween"
3438,That would be pretty amusing. Should put a football helmet on it and it will be a Vikings retriever.
3438,hahaha and that would actually be relevant! we live in MN during the superbowl a few years back
3438,"I'm just next door to the west.  Wife grew up there, I'm more of an Indy fan."
3438,sweet.
3439,Interesting.  How old is the book?
3439,"I haven't read that book since I was in college in the mid 90s. As we age, we tend to forget...lol"
3439,I know that drill lol. 
3439,"Yes, when you hit your mid 50s, things just fade fade and fade away sometimes...lol"
3439,"I am almost there but sometimes I can't recall why I even entered a room.  And I had a purpose, that I could recall."
3439,"lol.. Come to think of it, I can barely recall the book by Dr. Seus names Green Eggs and Ham...lol"
3439,"Ha.  What did you study in college?  If you can remember, only kidding."
3439,I studied Psychology. I have a BS.
3439,"Funny, I have a BA.  "
3439,What do you have your BA in?
3439,"Psychology.  I initially wanted to be a psychologist, but by my senior year I knew I wasn't built for another few years of school."
3439,"oh no, I'm so sorry. Weird, I wanted to be a Psychologist too but shortly after graduating I came down with several chronic illnesses that nearly ended my life."
3440,Do you do much golfing?
3440,"Actually I do! As a librarian, I spend my days cooped up inside so it's nice to go out and golf every now and then. How about you?"
3440,"I have only really done Top Golf, are you familiar with that?"
3440,I haven't but I should give it a try. But hitting balls at the range is nowhere near as much fun as the real thing. Do you have other hobbies?
3441,What kind of meat is your favorite?
3441,I like an aged steak. You have any hobbies?
3441,I like carving and eating pumpkins
3441,I enjoy canning meat and whittling. Whittling and carving are similar.
3441,"I like to carve spoons and bowls, what kind of wood do you whittle mostly?"
3441,Pine is nice and soft.
3441,"I usually carve cherry or birch, I cut down green wood to carve."
3441,Green wood? is that better?
3441,"It's better for traditional spoon carving, I use a hatchet for roughing out the blanks and then a hook knife and a sloyd knife for the finer work"
3441,Is the knife named after Jim Bowie? He is famous for the Sandbar fight.
3441,It is a Swedish style knife actually.
3441,are you from Sweden??
3442,That's cool. I don't have much family I am a widow
3442,"Aw I'm sorry. I have a dog who I see as my best friend, maybe you should get one...?"
3442,"That's a good idea, I just got divorced and could use a friend"
3442,"It's always good to have a friend, I am rather shy most of the time but it helps"
3442,I am too! I think a dog is a great idea
3442,"Haha I'm glad, you'll be happier !"
3442,i am thank you
3442,No problem
3442,your awesome. nice talking to you
3442,oh thanks! it was nice to chat with you as well
3442,thanks
3442,you are most welcome . . i hope you had a great day
3443,do you like jello?
3443,"i like jello , but it isn't my favorite thing, what about you?"
3443,it is my absolute favorite food
3443,"They kind of remind me of the holidays, I'm not a fan of holidays."
3443,"I love holidays, because I get to spend time at home with my pets. Do you have any pets?"
3443,I have 3. What kind of pets do you have?
3443,I have 4 cats. What kinds do you have?
3443,I have 2 a dogs and a cat. I really love them.
3443,That's awesome. What are their names?
3443,"they are tabbitha , julius , and marmalade . they are all yellow . do you have pets ?"
3443,"I do! I have four cats, name Abby, Baby, Rufus, and Todd."
3443,i love the names . it sounds like you have a house full . hobbies ?
3444,Yeah i hate it.  sometimes i wonder if i should try alcohol and see if that helps
3444,You probably shouldn't try to cope through means that can lead to addictions.
3444,"yeah maybe true.  i've just never had it before, and sometimes i wonder if it might help me loosen up."
3444,"It does help in small doses, indeed."
3444,"that's a good point on the addiction thing though, wouldn't want to do the ol' outta the fryig pan into the fryer thing..."
3444,Hahaha.. I know what you mean.
3444,it just sounds like such an easy fix too.  
3444,Quick fixes are not always of the best kind
3444,"I think I'm gonna go get therapy at some point, it's just so annoying to have to do."
3444,At first it might seem like that but it's all for the greater good. Everything is awkward at first.
3444,"Yeah, it probably get a lot easier after the first phone call."
3444,"It does really, the moment you get your confidence up, it all dissolves away."
3445,"I do office work.  I like writing on the side, but haven't made a career of it."
3445,"What kind of writing do you do? Short stories, novels?"
3445,I wrote a short story in high school.  My instructor though it was good and entered it in a contest.
3445,Did you win? If so you should try to turn into something more than a short story. You never know!
3445,"It did not win, but I didn't feel bad.  I really didn't spend too much time writing it."
3445,Nice. I've tried writing before. I'm more of an artist type. I like to paint.
3445,"What is your favorite subject matter to paint?  Food, animals or nature?"
3445,"Mostly landscapes and such, mountains are my favorite."
3445,You should try to get one featured at a gallery.
3445,I did at a local gallery and it went pretty well. I was pretty surprised.
3445,That's nice.  I won a local baking contest for the best cake once.  I won $300.
3445,"Best cake, I love love love cake! What kind of cake was it? 300 is a nice chunk of change!"
3446,what are the other 2 ?  
3446,Lion and Tiger?
3446,what about the cheetah ?  or perhaps the mountain lion ?
3446,Mountain lion would be my best guess. Cheetahs are the fastest for sure. 
3446,how do you know so much about these felines ?  you are smart .
3446,Im a cat fan. Plus I love nature.
3446,"I have 2 house cats that I adore ... therefore, we have something in common !"
3446,Are they babies?
3446,"they were when I got them,, but they are now over 7 years old ,,, very cute"
3446,"Oh ok. One day when my children become responsible, we'll get a few pets."
3446,how many children do you have ?  what are the ages ?
3446,2 girls 3 and 5
3447,I love music! WBu
3447,Do you play an instrument or just enjoy listening.
3447,I dont play anything but my favorite group is the backstreet boys
3447,Oh yes.  I like them too.  I always get that group confused with another boy band though.
3447,Which boy band lol
3447,Which one had Justin Timberlake?  The other one had Nick Lachey?
3447,i dont but hes one of my favorites too
3447,That was a long time ago.  Time flies!
3447,What other music do you like? Did you listen to the new kanye west album 
3447,A little bit.  I am horrible with remembering titles of songs though.  Are you a big fan?
3447,YES A huge fan but im disappointed with the latest one?
3447,"Oh, that's too bad.  What is different that you don't care for it too much?"
3448,I'm heading to Australia with some friends.
3448,"Oh wow! I have plans to vacation in Myrtle Beach, SC and I've never been there."
3448,Oh that sounds very nice!  Are you going with friends or family?
3448,I'm going with my girlfriend of 24 years. She was the security officer turned police at my junior college in Texas.
3448,"Oh, awesome!  I'm going on my trip with friends.  They're interesting to travel with, and I like psychoanalyzing them."
3448,I have a habit of psychoanalyzing people. I've lost a lot of friendships because of my degree in Psychology I behave so like I have a PHd. in Psychology..lol
3448,"I ended up becoming a special ed teacher, but I have always had a huge interest in psychology!"
3448,Oh that's great. I ended up as a substitute teacher for a school district.Now I work online tutor polish students living in Poland.
3448,Oh that's interesting!  I have some friends that do online tutoring and like it.
3448,Awe thank you. I love it. I'm working online for almost a year and a half. It's so convenient..not a lot of money but convenient.
3448,That's great!  Happiness with what you're doing is worth a lot!
3448,I do it mostly because I like helping humanity. What do you teach?
3448,I teach special ed in elementary school.
3448,Awe that's great i subbed for a special ed teacher. It's take a lot of love/patience. Good for you.
3449,"no, im going to disney land in two days! i heard they have an extensive library too."
3449,Disneyland? I forgot there's a difference between 
3449,"Between disneyworld? yeah, they're located on opposite side of the country!"
3450,I need to get a family car with great safety features.
3450,Oh? Do you have a big family?
3450,I have two children.  How about you?
3450,My children are all grown with kids of their own. Now it's just me and my dogs and my parrot. How old are your children? 
3450,"4 and 6.  Both boys.  But we have a dog, too, and take her with us when we travel."
3450,That sounds lovely! Where has been your favorite place to travel to?
3450,Usually to visit the grandparents.  How old are your grandchildren?
3450,"I'm sure they love that. I love seeing my grandkids. Mine are 3, 5, and 7. Time flies!"
3450,Are you thinking of buying a car?
3450,Maybe. If prices go down. 
3450,What kind are you thinking of buying?
3450,Probably just a reliable sedan. Nothing too fancy! Any suggestions? 
3451,"Yeah, I didn't do as well as I'd hoped.  Are you good at math?"
3451,"I am terrible at math, it's my worst subject."
3451,What was you best subject?
3451,I really liked history. What about you?
3451,I loved English.  I read a lot growing up and loved going to movies as well.
3451,I read a lot too and love to watch movies and shows. I binge watch a lot of netflix and prime video
3451,What's you favorite TV show?
3451,The first 4-5 seasons of Game of Thrones were really good. What do you think?
3451,I haven't watched that.  Isn't it kind of gory?
3451,"It is but it was really well written, it started to go down hill in the later stages of the show."
3451,"Oh, shows run out of ideas, don't they?  When I was a kid, I loved watching Bugs Bunny cartoons."
3451,"I loved Bugs Bunny, I watched him a lot as well"
3452,"Near Stone Oak and Hollywood Park. It's a little expensive, but it's great here!"
3452,"Oh my, not familiar with that area. Do you like it?"
3452,"Love it, aside from the worrying about my son adjusting to his new school!"
3452,That's exciting!  I hope he's doing well in school!
3452,"Well, so far hiss grades are holding up, but I think he's having trouble with the fact that the other kids have a lot more money than us. "
3452,oh boy . hopefully he has changes to make too .
3452,"I know watching everybody else wear nicer clothes, drive nice cars, and go anywhere can be hard on a kid."
3452,"It can be a trying time, though a lot of valuable lessons!"
3452,You said it. Hopefully he comes out a better person for it. So how have your kids and you been?
3452,Mine are grown. We get together at least once a week.
3452,That's so lovely to hear! A lot of parents see their grown kids once a year or less! It's so sad! You must have been great parents!
3452,"We use to live further away, though moved closer together about a year ago. It's been great!"
3453,"Wow, Awesome. "
3453,Yeah I love walking in the woods and just enjoying the pure quiet and peace.
3453,Its definitely good for relaxing our mind and body.  
3453,It is. Have you heard of The Story So Far? They are my new favorite group. Just awesome stuff.
3453,"Oh, I never heard about it, I ll check it out, is that on Facebook. And what they talk about in that group?"
3453,Yeah very good group. Kind of a techno sound I guess. Check biz122448@gmail.com out!
3453,Sure. Thanks for the info. I love travelling too and my dream is to roam around the world.
3453,That's their email but on second thought probably better not write them out of the blue lol. 
3453,"Ok, No, LOL. If I had more money I would have traveled around the world and would have bought expensive pens. "
3453,"That would be a great hobby, travel the world and collect pens. Might take some money though."
3453,"Yeah, but chasing one by one in my life. I gotta go , will see you later.TC"
3453,"Take care, and good luck on your world travels :)"
3454,I always found the stepmother interesting in Cinderella.
3454,I really like the stepmother in Tangled. Have you seen it? Rapunzel is locked in a tower for her whole life but her mother-figure lets her have so many hobbies!
3454,I haven't seen Tangled yet.  It looks fun.  
3454,Very cute movie! I like to sketch some of the stills of the movie when I'm lacking inspiration. What do you do for fun?
3454,I like to look for vintage clothing in thrift stores.  Cardigan sweater are a favorite thing to look for.
3454,That's cool! What's the neatest thing you've found thrifting?
3454,I found a old wooden box that had images of lions and tigers on it.  It was like brand new and I keep jewelry in it.
3454,That's very cool. I'd be nervous to buy something haunted by an evil spirit.
3454,That might be scary if true!  You just want a old suitcase or something and it turns out to be haunted by the former owner!
3454,UGH I can't imagine! Maybe they died while on a very serious business trip and they're haunting their luggage because they want their secret documents back.
3454,They'd wait until you went to sleep to dig for the documents in the suitcase and in you desk.  Watch out!
3454,"Haha, I'd use my karate skills to chop them. Can you karate chop a ghost?"
3455,It sure was. I
3455,Oh thats awesome! Kittens are adorable. They also have a better sense of smell then humans too!
3455,I'm just glad it wasn't hiding under one of the cars in the driveway.  i have a lot of cars there
3455,Wow! I wish I had a car but I live on a campus. 
3455,campus life must be fun...do you watch basketball?
3455,"No, not really. I'm more into music."
3455,what kind of music?
3455,I love all types of music but anything that has to do with the guitar has my heart.
3455,have you composed any of your own music yet?
3455,"No, but I am actually going to be working on a piece after finals week."
3455,That sounds great! I wish I had some talent like that.  
3455,It just takes a lot of practice that's all. Do you play anything?
3455,done
3456,I thought one of my four siblings could take my cat to school for show and tell.
3456,hah! that sounds great! maybe we could can up some tuna to take along as well
3456,"My dad teaches at the middle school they go to, so we'll just send it along with him."
3456,sounds good! im sure they will love all the extra MEAT!!!
3456,It should be a fun day for all.
3456,WOOHOO! I sure love whittling up a storm on a sunday night!
3456,Whittling would be a good thing today. We had 4 inches of snow last night. I'm staying inside.
3456,Hoo-whee! I reckon I'd stay inside too. Im down here in the deep south strawbale country
3456,I'm pretty far south too. But we had snow anyway!
3456,"oh no, i couldnt do no snow! I never even seen it, I think i would freeze!"
3456,"I don't like snow. It's pretty on postcards, but not in my yard."
3456,"ha! better to eat it as a treat, melt mallows and drizzle syrup and VOILA1"
3457,I suppose. But it's hard to find a job that lets me express my creativity you know.
3457,"Yes, it is hard to find a job that works with your best traits.  "
3457,What do you do for a living? If you don't mind me asking.
3457,"I work in public relations, but I'd really love to draw and would like to work as an artist."
3457,"Ah, a fellow artist at heart I see. I make films myself. "
3457,That's really interesting.  Have they been entered into film festivals?
3457,"I've had one that was, yes. But that was a long time ago when I was living in Mexico City."
3457,"I know someone who worked for Robert Redford's company, Sundance.  He liked it."
3457,That's awesome! But how about you? Have you published any of your drawings?
3457,"No, maybe I will enter a contest soon.  That would be fun.  "
3457,You definitely should. You never know until you try.
3457,Who is your favorite film director?
3458,"I don't know much about it, just a brief vague description. Tell me about it!"
3458,It is a form of contemporary art.  The trend is toward installations that speak to conservation.
3458,"I see. So like burning the house made of matches down, and talking about it while it burned?"
3458,I don't think so.  More like here is a whale sculpture made from rubbish from the sea.
3458,"Ohhhhhh!!! Awesome, and makes way more sense! So, do you do installation art yourself or know someone who does>\"
3458,"No, but sometimes I think my cat has some artistic tendencies.  She ""installs"" her finds all of the house."
3458,Bwaahhhahah! What a coincidence! Since my parents died in that plane crash last year I sometimes do that myself. I guess I shouldn't be telling you that though...
3458,"Sorry to hear that.  Art can help with stress relief, for sure."
3458,That's kind of what I was thinking as well. Maybe I should check into the installation art thing. It sounds like it could be pretty intense
3458,There are so many messages within each piece of art.  You get to interpret.
3459,I love pretzels. What do you do for work?
3459,I work as a roadie for my favorite band vv nation
3459,I've never heard of them! What kind of music do they play?
3459,Rock music. What kind of music are you into?
3459,I love rock music! Do you enjoy your job?
3459,It
3459,"My job stresses me out, so I tend to read on my lunch breaks."
3459,Sorry I meant my laswt message to say It's long hours but totally fun.  What kind of books do you like?  I love the Lord of the Ring.
3459,That's okay! I love Tolkien! I think the Silmarillion is his best book.
3459,"I'm actually re-reading that one now.  I love the lore, but don't really like the whole idea of elves fighting elves.  Bad Feanor!  LOL"
3459,I know what you mean! What else do you like to do in your free time?
3459,I'm a gamer.  I like playing Destiny 2.  Are you into any kind of gaming?/
3460,People just seem to lack common manners today.
3460,"They've never heard of decency, have they?"
3460,It looks that way.  I have a small business and I really try to be decent with people. 
3460,Oh that is nice. Do you have a website for your business?
3460,"No, not yet.  I work out of an office with a friend.  We sell antiques."
3460,Oh that is interesting. My husband loves antiques. He even loved them way back in college when I met him.
3460,What is his most valued piece that he has found?
3460,"Some Victorian era items, or things like that. He knows more than me. But how about you?"
3460,I have a very old vanity with a big mirror.  It was in great shape.  It's in my bedroom.
3460,That is amazing. I know my husband would love to have something like that in his collection. Any idea what the value is for it?
3460,"I think it's worth several thousand dollars.  I only paid $400 for it, though."
3460,Wow! What a steal!
3461,i need to find myself another band to play in
3461,What instrument do you play?
3461,i like to play the guitar
3461,Acoustic or electric guitar? They both produce different sounds.
3461,"i like to dabble in both, although i do prefer electric"
3461,That's cool! Both of my sons play acoustic guitar. I like how the hollow wood sounds compared to the electric amp.
3461,"yea they really do have a unique sound, how old are your sons?"
3461,four and five. that's not that old but still lol. amazing they grow up so quickly
3461,haha well im sure if they keep at it they will be great
3461,I hope they do! Do you have any kids?
3461,"nah not that i know of at least, being in bands and having groupies you never know!"
3461,You never know.
3462,"Oh No, you are just fifteen. and take your height and age as your advantage "
3462,I'm okay with being so tall. It doesn't bother me when people try to make a big deal of it.
3462,"Yeah. You said it. I have only 3 toes on my right foot, and I am being special because of that."
3462,Three toes? Was there an accident? I hope you don't mind my asking.
3462,"Of course not, I was born with 3 toes. Do you like eggs ? "
3462,"Yes, I like eggs. Eggs with ketchup. Yum! "
3462,wow yummy...same here ...usually i make scrambled eggs using 6 eggs for my breakfast.
3462,"Oh, I don't eat that many eggs with my meals. Maybe 2 max. "
3462,"oh, that's sound good. Avoiding breakfast is not good for health..need to eat something"
3462,I agree with you. Breakfast is important. Sometimes I eat oatmeal.
3462,That's a perfect breakfast...what else  do you like in the morning?
3462,In the summer time I drink smoothies for breakfast. How about you?
3463,"most of times, but there are times when this doesn't happen"
3463,"I think sometimes we are too hard on ourselves, we all know right from wrong."
3463,That is somewhat correct. We all have choices from the very start.
3463,"True, choices are what molds us. I'm moving to San Diego in a couple of months and only time will tell if that choice is correct."
3463,"Oh wow, really?"
3463,I'm pretty anxious about it but much more opportunities there as compared to now where I work as a cashier at a gas station.
3463,I can totally understand the situation you are in. I had the same situation recently when I moved to a new country
3463,"Oh wow, a new country seems much more ambitious than what I am doing."
3463,"Maybe, but change from the routine is something which needs a lot of courage to do. There are some people who fail to do the same."
3463,"Agreed, that's a great attitude to have, we only fail if we don't try, right?"
3463,totally agree. We have to give out 100% regardless of the outcome and without any expectations
3463,I always say hard work and a tiny bit of luck and you can accomplish anything.
3464,Not bitter at all? Do you like nuts in your brownies? And what about frosting the brownies? Are you for or against it? I personally love frosted brownies!
3464,"Depends on the brownies - I'm not usually wild about frosted brownies, but there are cases where it can work!"
3464,Do you prefer dogs or kittens?
3464,"Kittens. Easily. I love dogs, but I mostly love other people's dogs lol."
3464,"I totally agree! Dogs can be a bit much, and not nearly as good in a stir fry IMO. They are quite loving though!"
3464,Loyal too. I'm just not trying to get a bath every time I pet one hahah. 
3465,I love to dance it's almost as good an exercise as running.
3465,"Yes,, it's good exercise for everyone and more exciting than running."
3465,Do you meet many people when you go out dancing?
3465,"it depends, but many times i do. If I go alone I will find many people to dance with"
3465,It can be a great way to meet new people that is one of the reasons I love dance.
3465,Do you usually go alone and find people to dance with or go with a partner already?
3465,I like to go alone and explore new dance clubs. Do you like clubs?
3465,Sometimes clubs can be a little too much for me.
3465,"I understand, I like the quieter places also sometimes."
3465,yes! but also it's hard to appreciate the quiet without the loud as well :)
3465,I like to run in the mornings and soak up the still and quiet before everyone wakes up.
3465,I'm sure that's quite the site and very relaxing.
3466,I don't have one. Don't need one. But jobs are for squares anyways.
3466,"It's good that you don't need a job. I work at a doctor's office for now, but want to be a dental hygienist."
3466,Ah I see. But what type of music do you listen to?
3466,All kinds! I love getting to hear some new bands.
3466,Nice. Do you like Linkin Park?
3466,I do. I like their album Hybrid Theory.
3466,That's my favorite! Though I'm not entirely certain why that is. I have it on vinyl. 
3466,Like the old vinyl ones? That's awesome!
3466,"Yeah, those big old school records. You should get some. Much better sound that on the computer."
3466,I'm not sure I've ever used them. I think my earliest music media was cassettes.
3466,That's dope. Cassettes are punk. We should form a band.
3466,"Sure, That's sounds like a real plan. lol"
3467,I guess helping tutor my younger siblings gave me a taste. I'm the oldest of 7.
3467,"Wow, that's a lot of kids. I can't imagine having that many younger siblings."
3467,"Yes, but big families aren't that unusual in my country of origin."
3467,Oh? Where are you from?
3467,Pakistan.
3467,That's cool. Do you ever go back?
3467,I'm planning on going back in a few months. It will be the first time in almost 10 years.
3467,That must be exciting. Airports are a great place to people watch.
3467,"They can be, if you don't die of boredom first."
3467,Haha fair enough! 
3467,"Actually, I don't like flying. I'm not afraid, but I hate the commercial airline, security, baggage. So tiring. But I am excited to meet some of my nieces and nephews."
3467,Well I hope you have safe travels! The trip will be worth the hassle.
3468,Yeah I usually take pics of barbies..i love barbies
3468,"Nothing wrong with that, I live near a park so it's the perfect background for pics."
3469,Oh thats a pretty color If reminds me of my favorite fruit whats your favorite fruit
3469,I don't know. I guess it depends which is in season. Mangoes are tasty.
3469,Oh yeah they are so what do you want to talk about
3469,What kind of work do you do? I'm a Judge. My next appointment will be on a federal court.
3469,Thats interesting i'm a stay at home mom
3469,Nice. What do you think of today's Judicial system? you think us Judges have to much power?
3470,You're right. I guess I'll have to be more careful next time.
3470,"I had a lot of friends as a kid, and so many accidentally broke things that belonged to their mom."
3470,Yeah. I think that kind of thing happens a lot. Did something like that ever happen to you? Did you get in trouble?
3470,"I can remember breaking a coffee mug, but my mom didn't really get mad.  She just asked me to be more careful."
3470,That's a good way of reacting! I think it teaches you to not respond to situations with anger.
3470,"Yes, that's the best way.  I remember my grandmother was the opposite way.  She overreacted to everything."
3470,Mine too! I would always get in more trouble with her than my own mother. It's funny how that works.
3470,"My grandfather was so calm, though.  I always admired him for that."
3470,That's probably why your mother was so reasonable. She probably got that trait from him.
3470,"Yeah, I think so.  I think my mom liked him more than she did her mother.  What was your granddad like?"
3470,"He was a really good man. He's actually the reason I'm a personal trainer today. We're both athletes, so we bonded a lot over our interest in fitness."
3470,How interesting.  Do you make pretty good money as a trainer.  I'm in debt and would be interested in doing it on the side.
3470,Yeah! It's decent. If you enjoy that kind of work I would definitely recommend looking into it.
3471,How many books have your father written? I'm a marketing director as a well know book publisher.
3471,He has written several. He has also written books from our travels in Ireland and Australia.
3471,Nice! Visiting Ireland is on my bucket list! How did you like Ireland?
3471,I love it there. It's so pretty
3471,I would love to travel more but work gets in the way. Most of my travel is for work. What do you do for work?
3471,"I freelance, and write some myself. I would definitely like to travel to more places. "
3471,I used to love reading as a kid. I should take up reading again. Have you read any good books lately?
3471,"Not recently, I have been very busy. What do you do for work?"
3471,I'm a marketing director. It's not fun anymore. I might change fields or go back to school.
3471,"Marketing can be fun, maybe you just need to change to a different type of marketing. Something new."
3471,"Yeah, you're probably right. "
3471,Sometimes just a small change can make a big difference.
3472,Yeah I do. I drive a big van around because I have 12 kids haha.
3472,"i live in a van i drive , so no kids"
3472,"Wow, that must feel so freeing. Are you a nomad?"
3472,I guess you could put it that way.
3472,Does it get cold in the winter living in your van? Do you go anywhere special during that time of year?
3472,I head down south to texas so it doesnt get too cold. If I didn't live in my vehicle I'd like to get a truck.
3472,Ah yes Texas. That must be warm. Much warmer than Canada!
3472,I love Texas.
3472,Have you ever been to California? I'd like to go there one day.
3472,No but I'd like to someday.
3472,Same. Maybe we can rent a truck and have a little roadtrip!
3472,"Sure, That's sounds like a real plan. lol"
3473,"Yeah, she's pretty cool."
3473,"Haha sorry, I'm good at math but not always super humorous."
3473,My kids and I love to ski too!
3473,Ah great! Snow ski and water ski? I'm guessing snow skiing which is coming up.
3474,"I did, and then I went to a cabin in the mountains to relax for awhile."
3474,"Good riddance!, I'm glad he's gone I try to get the mountains every chance I get. I love skiing."
3474,"Yeah, it's snow skiing in the mountains."
3474,Do you ski much? I've tried snow boarding before but I always end up back on skis. The mountains are so beautiful.
3474,I ski twice a year and I agree that the mountains are beautiful.
3475,not really sure.. it is a mutt.. what kind of dogs do you have?
3475,"Mine are all mutt, too. Just like us! The more mixed in, the merrier. My son really loves to take the doggies to the dog park. you?"
3475,"unfortunately, dont have time to take him to the park.. i do take him for runs from time to time"
3475,Is your dog big enough to take you for a run?  Is it a dog or a horse?
3475,lol.. he's a little older so i am the one who takes him for the run.. i have to take it easy on him
3475,"One of mine is as old as Methuselah, or so it seems. He always loved eating carrots so now I nuke them to be soft.  "
3475,gotta love the furry friends.. do you have any children?
3475,"Yes, Minime wants me to buy a horse. I'm not sure it would fit on our patio, though. :)"
3475,yeah.. that probably wouldn't work.. kids say the darndest things
3475,"With the boy and dogs and cat and guinea pigs and fish, we have a house full. What about you?"
3475,"two boys, a girl, and a dog so i can relate.. we definitely stay busy"
3475,"I'm thinking that I need an extra job to feed them all. I've heard about working for Amazon, some turkey thing."
3476,Yes it got out right when the sun was going down.
3476,I'm sorry for your loss. Do you have other pets?
3476,Yes I got two cats right now and how about you?
3476,I don't have any pets because I'm too busy with work. I used to have a cat but that was 15 years ago.
3476,Yes schedules can get in the way - I do like having my cats though.  What kind of cat did you have?
3476,I'm not sure what breed she was. I adopted her when she was a few months old. Her name was Seb.
3476,Nice I have two brothers named Owen and Mason.  Have you ever owned a dog?
3476,"No, I've owned a dog. Do you like dogs?"
3476,I do like dogs but never owned one since I am too busy
3476,What do you do for work?
3476,Teacher and a coach keeps me hoping and you?
3476,I'm a mechanic. My car broke down yesterday so I'm home troubleshooting the issue.
3477,"I can't wait to retire, so I can spend more time with her."
3477,That is really great! Marriage is so important and sacred I think.
3477,"It is, especially when you find the right person. The initial phase of love fades, so it's important to find a person who always makes you smile."
3477,Yes
3477,Are you married?
3477,Happily married pushing 30 years. My faith has helped me through my marriage a lot.
3477,"30 years is a long time, congratulations."
3477,"Thank you. So the subject is shopping online, do you like to shop online?"
3477,"Yes, I do. I try to shop online as much as possible. It saves so much time."
3477,Where do you shop?
3477,"Many different places. If a store has a website, I try to order from it unless I need something immediately."
3477,"Yes, I do shop a lot off Amazon. Wishing you all the best!"
3478,I feel bad about it but it was just once since i've been dieting.
3478,That's not so bad. Everyone cheats on their diet from time to time. I would just pick up where you left off.
3478,"Thanks I will, I like to draw and paint so that distracts my mind from dieting."
3478,"Good, put those artistic talents to use! It's also good to spend time with family. I'm trying to do that too."
3478,"Always good to spend time with family, it's always so rewarding."
3478,It certainly does put me in a good emotional state. How many siblings do you have?
3478,"I have 3 siblings, we spend time together driving around in my four wheel drive truck."
3478,I've never driven a truck haha. How's that working out for you?
3478,"Not bad at all, it's great fun. Especially when we take it in the mud!"
3478,"Awesome. I was living in the city for the last four years, not many trucks around there. College life ya know."
3478,"I get that, have you finished up with college?"
3478,Yep! Just graduated. Now struggling to get a job.

3480,"Nah I've never played the guitar, but I want to learn to play an instrument at some point."
3480,which instrument would you like to learn to play? Wind or String instruments?
3480,String...I think playing the violin would be amazing.

3481,Yeah. I love listening to music and travelling. I really wanna go to Italy
3481,You should really go! I'm sure it'd be a great experience.I travel to go skiing.
3481,Planning actually. I really want to try Alpine skiing if I get a change. Do you do skiing a lot?
3481,I do! It's one of my favorite things to do.
3481,Thats cool. What kind you skiing do you most like ?
3481,Just your usual downhill skiing. You should give it a shot. It's a lot of fun.
3481,"Yeah, I'll. I think, it would be great if I could do skiing when I visit Italy."
3481,I like your thinking. Get it all done in one go!
3481,Yeah. Do you have any dream place or country to visit?
3482,I love deserts as I used to live in Arizona. Sometimes I draw the deserts from home in class instead of taking notes.
3482,I really enjoy drawing deserts as well. It is a peaceful scene. I love deserts except that my blue eyes are always sensitive to the bright light
3482,"I know what you mean, mine are sensitive to fluorescent lights though.The sun makes me at peace."
3482,I often wish I had brown eyes.
3482,Brown huh? Mine are green and they have a cool bluish tint at times in the sun.
3482,That must be why you love the desert because the sun brings out your green-bluish eyes
3482,"Yeah, kn the desert and the fantasy worlds I create for myself at times. Always day dreaming!"
3482,"What kind of desert do you like to draw? hot, sandy or cold?"
3482,I like the sandy ones. So many different critters to draw moving about.
3482,What are you favorite desert animals to draw?
3482,"I like scorpions and snakes, to draw that is. Not so much in my tent, lol."
3482,I understand. Interesting creatures but not interesting to have up close and personal
3483,I did not know that but that is cool that Skateboarding is an Olympic sport now.
3483,"I would love to attend especially in Japan, but I have to work all the time, it seems. How about you? Have you traveled this year?"
3483,"I have not traveled this year, but my son is in the military and based in Japan. Would love to visit. Where else have you gone?"
3483,South America is my favorite destination. Quito is my fave city. I really love the place. 
3483,"Wow I would love that. About skateboarding, do you skateboard at all?"
3483,I've never tried. It looks like fun but I'd rather spend my day writing. Maybe I'll write a travel book. What about you?  Do you skateboard?
3483,Yes I used to skateboard and was good at it. Writing a travel book that sounds like fun?
3483,"Truthfully, traveling means a lot of time waiting around, the perfect time and location to document the events. What do you do for fun these days?"
3483,"As I am getting a bit older and I live in Central FL, I go to the theme parks a lot. "
3483,Aaahhh... an adrenaline junkie! That's great. Do you get season passes?
3483,Yes I have season passes to all the theme parks here. Do you like theme parks?
3483,I do. I have found the secret for the best day. Go on Mother's/Father's day. You'll have the whole park with zero lines!
3484,"Oh my, that is great you know that. I am not that great in cars."
3484,"I love cars, especially antique ones."
3484,"I am not good at remembering make and models, though like the antique ones too."
3484,"I have several antique vehicles, and love to wake up early in the morning to go for a drive."
3484,That is really neat you can do that! 
3484,What do you do for fun?
3484,"I enjoy going to church, fellowship around the Word, around the Lord. That is my pleasure."
3484,That's great.
3484,"I like to serve my family, help with whatever too."
3484,It's important to spend as much time with family as possible.
3484,"It sure is, and no matter how old, to help guide gently. All the best to you!!!"
3484,That's so true. The best to you as well.
3485,"Well we'd both like to be able to spend more time with the kids. Between the five of them, it's hard to make sure they all get enough attention."
3485,i can relate.. we have three and it's difficult so i can only imagine having five
3485,"It can be stressful, but it's rewarding. What's your favorite thing to do with your kids?"
3485,definitely rewarding.. i just like to spend my off days hanging out.. playing in the play room or running around outside
3485,"That's good, try to get them away from the TVs and tablets for a bit."
3485,exactly.. i can't stand the tvs and tablets.. turns them into zombies
3485,"There's a place for them, but they get overused. My kids can play educational games but only for a small portion of the day."
3485,that's definitely the way to do it
3485,"Do you have any pets? We love animals, the kids spend their walks pointing out all the creatures we see."
3485,"yes, one dog.. our kids like to do the same"
3485,Aw that's sweet. I know as a veterinarian I'm not supposed to have favorites but I'm definitely more of a dog person.
3485,Amazing.. i won't tell anyone :)
3486,"Pets are the best, I have 3 dogs."
3486,I have 2 dogs that are my babies what do you plan on doing this weekend?
3486,Well I have to work at my vet's office job other than that I think it will rain.
3486,oh no working is the worse during the weekend...do you like football?
3486,"Have to make that money! Love football, who's your team?"
3486, I am a New York Giants Fan...Who is your favorite team?
3486,Giants are off to a rough start this year. I like the New 
3486,oh gosh yes they are! I don't know if Eli will make it after this year
3486,"No I think he may be out, young guy looks good just needs time."
3486,exactly..he does need to retire but who knows hes no Payton lol
3486,"Not at all, definitely the lesser Manning!"
3486,LOL!!! well hopefully they get better starting this Sunday or we are done lol
3487,"I hope they say yes too! Yees, this will be my first home"
3487,"Lets hope so. Yeah I'm a home owner, was just out changing the oil on my 26 year old beater."
3487,What kind of car is it?
3487,"1993 Geo Merto, one of the few in the county lol Still running as it had a remanufactured engine put in a few years ago."
3487,Wow that is very impressive! 
3487,"Thanks, usually I'm just hanging on the computer so got some exercise sort of, it was such a nice day."
3487," Yes, it was a nice day here too. So I need some help with this little dilemma that I have."
3487,"Ok sure,  what's going on?"
3487,"my mom wants to move in and I have two dogs, but she allergic"
3487,"Oh man, tell her the dogs have to be there so keep it short or maybe she can find a good over the counter allergy pill."
3487,yea I never thought about the allergy meds.. ill give that a try!
3487,"Great, always good to have mom visit for sure."
3488,What was your favorite part?
3488,I love the part where the good guys are able to defeat the bad guys. What is your favorite part
3488,"Oh same, the good guys are the best. I also like the story behind it."
3488,"Yes, so do I. I don't always have time to play though as my kids keep me busy"
3488,"Oh, I don't have children. I feel it's hard for me to connect sometimes. But I'm happy for you!"
3488,I am sorry it is hard for you to connect. Our society can be very individualistic making it hard to connect
3488,Yes. But it's nice you have the chance to pass good values on to the next generation! And maybe I will too.
3488,I hope you are able to as well. I think it is important for future generations to be raised in loving homes
3488,Empathy and fairness can help as well.
3488,I agree. There are many characteristics that are important
3488,Do you have other hobbies? I mostly enjoy video games.
3488,I am currently looking for a job so my hobby is to go to job interviews
3489,"Sounds good, I've made some quick judgments myself."
3489,Its a romantic story about the emotional development of the main character Elizabeth. She learns that making rash decisions can be hard.
3489,I know the feeling. I made a rash decision at 53 to move to Alabama. Still regretting that one.
3489,What is the weather like there? What about the people? What made you regret the move?
3489,"It's hot, really hot and especially in the summer, so humid. The people are laid back and nice. I moved for a job that didn't' work out."
3489,"Oh, well i hope the tides turn for you soon!"
3489,They will once I'm out of here!
3489,Where are you thinking of going from there?
3489,"Maybe Alaska, polar opposite I know but it beautiful there."
3489,I'd love to visit there sometime. I agree; it's beautiful. I wouldn't want to live there though; the cold would be too much for me.
3489,I don't mind the cold so much. Before Alabama I lived in Boston. Winters can be brutal!
3489,"Yeah, I grew up that way and the changing of seasons is awesome, but the winters can get pretty long and dreary."
3490,"I think so, who are some of your favorite metal bands?"
3490,"I like breaking benjamin, they are my favorite but they are on the lighter side"
3490,"Great band, I tend to shy away from concerts though, lol"
3490,The concerts are too intense for me.
3490,I try to incorporate the metal in the commercials I work on when possible
3490,You work on commercials? That's cool! Do you do ones with animals?
3490,"Occasionally but you know what they say, don't work with pets or kids haha"
3490,I can only imagine! Do you have any pets or kids?
3490,3 dogs but no kids
3490,"No kids here either. I have a cat, but have always wanted to get a pot bellied pig, I hear they make great pets."
3490,That's awesome. I am sure it would be an adventure
3490,"I'd have to stop eating bacon, I'd feel too guilty if I actually had a pet pig."
3491,Natural red hair is so beautiful.
3491,it is ! makes me feel like the little mermaid with my red hair .
3491,That's awesome. Is your hair straight or wavy?
3491,It is quite literally my favorite hair color - I so wish my hair were like hers! and I love red rose
3491,It is mine too. 
3491,Gorgeous! Did she ever enter them in a rose show?  Once went there with my pet cat
3491,"Yes, I do beleive she won first place with her roses."
3491,She definitely won that one.most of the people like rose.
3491,"Yes, most people do.. There are so many different kinds of roses."
3491,yes . i also really like roses . what do you like ? red or other colors?
3491,I like yellow roses
3491,"Yellow was my favorite color when I was younger, but I really like black now."
3491,I like black roses too.
3491,that's sound good..tc..bye
3492,you could contact your local colleges and see if they offer programs
3492,Good idea. Check to see if there any groups on facebook of your interest.
3492,thats something i havent thought of trying...im going to give it a shot
3492,you should definitely do that . is there anything else you really like to do ?
3492,"i can speak 4 diifferent languages, fluently!"
3492,"That's really impressive you know so many, did you ever study languages scientifically, also known as linguistics?"
3492,"no i havent, its more like a hobby, something i pick up easily...where have you learned about linguistics?"
3492,That's interesting. A lot of cool things to learn for sure.
3492,where are you from? what languages are spoken there?
3492,"Just USA, and just English. "
3492,what do you do for a living? i am a plumber
3492,"A housewife here, help my family wherever and how ever I can :)"
3493,"It's never easy to be fully responsible for another person, no matter where you are in life. Unless it's in the 1%."
3493,One has to make an attempt to raise them right but at some point they have a life to live
3493,My oldest just got a job for a super organization known all over the world. He's worked so hard. I'm very proud. One more to go!
3493,That is awesome! you must very proud of him!
3493,"And he's proud of me, too. Full time classes premed, Full time work weekends, taking care of little brother. Whew! What about you?"
3493,Stay at home and hold the fort down for a bit going back to school once my mother is doing better
3493,Hey--I've heard of a freelance job you can do at home for extra pennies. I was thinking about doing it on my phone during my commute. 
3493,not a bad idea ! i might have to do that !
3493,I've heard that you can spend and hour or 2 to get your lunch money or whatever. It's seems more productive than phone games or FB. 
3493,A friend of mine actually commutes from home doing customer service for a fortune 500 company he does great!
3493,Working in your pajamas sounds like the biggest fantasy! Maybe I can go into telemedicine and only dress up on top each day and wear pj pants.
3493,That is one of new ideas that some people are talking about to control medical costs sounds promising
3494,"I have been to sweden, it was very fun"
3494,Oh I would love to go to Sweden. I have been to Spain and my husband has been Germany
3494,One of my friends lives in germany right now. I am jealous
3494,What city does she or he live in
3494,Ramstein
3494,That's interesting. I used to teach history and love European history
3494,Thats cool! He lives there because he is in the military
3494,What kind of job does he do in the military?
3494,"I am not entirely sure, something with planes i think"
3494,Oh he must be in the air force
3494,Yes he is
3494,My husband is retiring from the military and then we will travel more
3495,I grew up on a farm so I learned to love country music early on.
3495,I like country music
3495,Who
3495,Old school country has a strong impact on me.  I like Shania Twain
3495,"Sorry. I meant to ask who you liked to listen to. I like everything from Hank Williams to the Dixie Chicks. Shania's good, too."
3495,"Shania's song ""From this Moment"" is my favorite."
3495,I really like Faith Hill. She has such a beautiful voice. 
3495,I like Faith Hill.  She's a great singer and entertainer.  She and her husband works well together.
3495,They
3495,They definitely make great music together.  You grew up together?
3495,"Yeah, and they've been together for what seems like forever. Sorry for bad typing. Think I'm all thumbs tonight."
3495,It's amazing that couples can work together.  I wonder how they deal with stress on the job.  
3496,that's why I'm still studying
3496,What are you studying?
3496,"Music, I would like to be a renowned musician"
3496,That is a good profession. I'm not sure what i wanna be yet. I haven't even left the United States yet!
3496,What about sports??
3496,I've never been into sports. But I do like hiking. I go all of the time. How about you?
3496,"no, i'm not good with sports"
3496,You've got your music at least. I know you'll be great if you keep studying.
3497,well i didn't understand any of it and i had to pass the test or else i would fail the class..have you failed a class
3497,"I hope not to, brother. My college days are beginning, but I' sure there will be temptation."
3497,lol yes when you have only 1 class to go oh well..what is your major?
3497,It is computer science. Looong campus. I take the bus there. You?
3497,oh I finished in May with an education degree
3497,That is phenomenal. We need a lot of educators and teachers. Seems like they are in short supply these days.
3497,yes because well they don't pay us enough but in computer science you should be making good $
3497,"It's a lot of sitting, my friend. And studies are showing sitting can be as bad as smoking."
3497,oh no I am all about the natural world and its beauty
3497,Very nice. Moving in a world that is stationary goes a long way. Your health matters the most.
3497,yes it does! Coming from a poor family now that I am earning more money i want to make sure i take care of everything
3497,Stay the course my friend. Opportunities will come and go. Doors always open. I make no money in college right now.
3498,that's awesome. what is your favorite breed?
3498,I loved Husky's! They are so Beautiful! What about you?
3498,Good choice. I like most of the bigger breeds. I can't stand the small yappy ones. Huskies have beautiful eyes/
3498,I mean i used to have a small dog.. His name was Casper... I loved small dogs until i got a big one lol! Cant ever go back!!
3498,Do you find that you need a bigger house with a bigger dog?
3498,"Hmmm, not really! I mean there not very active... I have a golden retriever/lab mix and she just sleeps all day! Really lazy!"
3498,that's good. are they more active when you go to the park?
3498,"Yeah , they run away ! i try to keep them close!"
3498,do you have one of the those sticks that throws the ball far away?
3498,"I do not! I do have lots of balls, they just take in and run into oblivion.. the ball never to be seen again..."
3498,lol. dogs are the best. :)
3498,I know right!
3499,i'm not much of a dancer.. :)
3499,I am sure you are good at many other things though.
3499,well that's nice of you to say.. what do you do for a living?
3499,i teach dancing at the arthur murray studio .
3499,well i guess one of us is a good dancer :) that sounds rewarding.. it must be nice to watch people get better at something
3499,"It is very rewarding, that is one of the main reasons I teach dance. What do you do for a living?"
3499,i am an analyst for an auto finance company
3499,"Thats cool. See, that's something your better at than me!"
3499,:) you are a pleasure to talk to.. what do you like to do in your free time?
3499,That was kind of you to say. You are a pleasure as well! I like to read thriller novels and binge watch Netflix. lol wby?
3499,can't go wrong with either of those.. i'm doing a little binge watching myself right now
3499,what are you watching now? 
3499,parks and recreation
3500,i bet that is very sadning.
3500,It took some time to learn to write again too
3500,"yeah that would be very hard for me also, espiecally my dominate hand."
3500,Yep i was left handed
3500,ever thought of getting a dog for service.
3500,I have but i am allergic to dogs
3500,"o ok make alott of since, how well was coping with cooking."
3500,Cooking was not that hard but washing dishes was
3500,yeah i can really imagine that being a problem.
3500,Its okay any challenge i will overcome
3500,that one of the best things about life.
3500,i agree i just need to learn how to be happy
3501,"I am working at mcdonalds right now, I can ask if they are hiring."
3501,That's nice of you. I've actually heard McDonalds isn't a bad place to work.
3501,"No worries, it isn't bad. Money isn't great but good people and you can work your way up."
3501,The benefits are supposed to be good. I don't know if I have the patience for it. Have you worked anywhere else?
3501,It does take patience for sure. It is my first job after college.
3501,I've thought about being a house sitter. Free place to live and you get paid for it!
3501,Sounds like a great gig! Do they have a basketball goal? I love playing.
3501,"Actually, they do. I'm awful at basketball. I'm tall, so everyone just assumes I'd be good at it."
3501,Well i'm not so good either but doesn't stop me from playing!
3501,I'm not all that athletic. I force myself to walk every morning just to make sure I do something! 
3501,Getting exercise is great for your overall health.
3501,"If I worked at McDonalds, I'd be doomed. Junk food and not enough exercise!"
3502,It's awesome exercise too; you use muscles you don't normally.
3502,"Very true, I love swimming in the ocean. I love getting out in nature as much as I can."
3502,Me too. I'm a nature buff. But I'm currently in FL and it can get really hot out. Water and sunscreen are a must if you're out for long.
3502,"You're lucky. I would love to be on the beach all day, listening to some good electronica music while the waves crash."
3502,"So would I if I lived near the beach. The beach at night is magical, and less crowded!"
3502,I'm sure it is. magical sounds like a great way to describe it. I don't mind crowds too much.
3502,"I do. And nighttime is just a little cooler. And if you're there with a full moon up, everything is silvery and beautiful"
3502,That sounds wonderful now that you put it that way. Say goodbye to sunburn!
3502,"Heh. Yes, no moonburn thankfully."
3502,"Maybe you can sell moonburn screen to the tourist, lol. "
3502,Lol. Or oil to purify your skin under the healing rays of Luna.
3502,"Pure skin would be a nice thing. Luna? tell me more, that sounds interesting."
3502,Luna's another name for the moon. It's been nice chatting with you; going to hit Done on my next turn if you don't.
3503,I believe they existed.  Serpents?
3503,Yeah like snakes but they can fly and are huge
3503,You know what?  I think I actually heard of the size.  Can you imagine if an adult should see one now?
3503,They would probably be frozen with fear
3503,I know I would.  I'm afraid of a small bee.  I would be terrified.
3503,For one wasp?
3503,"Yes, I'm even scared of dogs.  Don't laugh a lot of people do."
3503,"Me either, imagine being bitten by one."
3503,I don't even want to imagine that.  I grew up in the Islands and dogs were used as security so they were always vicious.
3503,They can be ferocious
3503,"I have to admit, some dogs are beautiful and lovely, but all in all they are all animals."
3503,They can even be nice though lol
3504,"the way I see it, I work at a 9 to 5 job, if I want a pet hedgehog, I can have one. "
3504,yea i agree with that
3504,what have you been up to lately? i've been busy volunteering at the soup kitchen. 
3504,i work a 9 5 office job
3504,me too. it's rough out there. 
3504,It is honestly especially when you have to work in the morning
3504,this is why we have weekends!
3504,The weekends are for the boys!
3504,completely. I can't wait for the next big game. 
3504,Yeah it should be a good one. Who is your favorite team?
3504,"right now, anyone but the New England Patriots ;)"
3504,"Ha, Im a patriots fan"
3505,"Yes everything is done and this Saturday night it all happens, wish you were here. You are invited :)"
3505,Thanks for the invitation!  I'll see if I can take the night off from my job at mcdonald s.!
3505,Hah Bring a few Big Macs for sure. I'll Reimburse you. Love a Big Mac!
3505,"LOL!  I've worked there so long that I hate the smell of them!  But if you want some, I'll certainly bring a few!"
3505,I hear ya. I worked at Domino.s and felt the same way. Get so sick of it.
3505,I love Dominos! I love to use their half price coupon every Monday! That's my day off work and I love to sleep all day then order pizza
3505,Dominos is good for sure. They still are doing well after all these years. Maybe the leader even of delivery pizza places.
3505,"Yep, I see their delivery vehicles all over the place!  Will you be having pizza at your party?"
3505,Definitely although I have to admit I'll be ordering Pizza Hut I hate say. Love Pizza Hut sauce.
3505,"That sounds awesome, Pizza Hut is good too!  I can't wait!"
3505,Yep Next Saturday. Really look forward to seeing you. Glad you can come. :) I'm so excited!!!
3505,Me too!  See you then!  Shall I bring anything?  Maybe some wine?
3506,I'm in art school because I want to create comics for a living.
3506,That would be a very interesting job! Quite fun too I would imagine.
3506,I hope so. I only have one year of school to go. I've started interviewing with some publisher already.
3506,"That's great! I would love to find a career, I am currently working as a waitress,"
3506,How long have you been a waitress? Are you on your feet all day long?
3506,"For about 2 years, yes on my feet a lot and I ride my bike to work so I get a lot of exercise."
3506,I ride my bike to school every day. It helps keep me fit. Are you going to school or planning ot?
3506,Would love to go to school but need to pay off some bills first.
3506,Which subject would you study?
3506,"Not entirely sure, might consider art like you are."
3506,"That's great! Especially with bots doing more menial work, it's important for people to have skills that are unique to them."
3506,I agree and it seems like the careers for art majors are very diverse.
3507,"Not really, no. I've only been broken up with once and I didn't care. Do you watch football?"
3507,"Yes! To the point that I'm totally unproductive! Good thing I have to go to work, then I'm a trooper."
3507,"Oh my older brother plays in the NFL, maybe you've seen him. "
3507,Wow! Who is he?
3507,"He's Blake Bell, he's an offensive lineman for the Chiefs"
3507,I haven't watched them lately. I'll have to now! I'm just going to have to quit eating junk food.
3507,"I know! I love popcorn. Although I suppose popcorn isn't that bad for you, right?"
3507,It's probably not. I just know I haven't been eating well. I need to eat a salad I think.
3507,I think so too. Maybe we should go buy a lot of vegetables right now. What do you think?
3507,"You know, that sounds really good. "
3507,Ok! Let's do it!
3507,A slice of pizza and a salad. I think I've turned over a new leaf!
3508,Oh wow I'd love to check it out. What types sell the best?
3508,"i've tried 35 kinds of beer fo far easy , since i work at the brewery"
3508,Oh I thought you worked at the grocery store! What's your favorite?
3508,I enjoy a fat tire craft beer from time to time
3508,Nice. I have noticed that biking and craft beer seem to go together lately.
3508,"Funny you say that, I like to ride my unicycle while drinking."
3508,yeah absolutely not the biking i was thinking of but that works! 
3508,Have you been to the new grocery store I started at last week
3508,"I don't think so, yet. Let me know if you get any interesting beer in there though. Do you like it?"
3508,"Sure do, the hours are flexible, and plenty of room for promotion."
3508,Nice. I think you'll do great there.
3508,thanks! :)
3509,"Oh, you mean like a Prius? I drive one of those. "
3509,thats cool. I love mine. What else do you do for the environment? i am big on recyling
3509,Recycling is good. My neighborhood recently stopped doing single sort. I try to be mindful of my waste. 
3509,thats great. I also try to conserve my energy use as well. My mom taught me that. 
3509,That's really good. There's no reason to be wasteful. I
3509,"well now, are you married? I married my high school sweetheart. "
3509,I am married. She used to be the girlfriend of my best friend. We hooked up while we were on vacation as a group.
3509,wow. thats interesting. How did your best friend take it when he found out? 
3509,It could have been worse. I think their relationship was done so I think he was relieved. 
3509,yeah I figured that might be the response. at least you guys are happy together now. 
3509,Yes. We both drive Priuses. And we pee in the woods to conserve water. 
3509,lol. thats funny. I won't go that far but I do my best to save water as well. 
3510,"I try to be.  Strangely, I have some really bizarre dreams about her at night!"
3510,"Oh wow, that must mean something! What was the dream about?"
3510,"I dreamed we got married, which is weird because I don't think I could ever commit to just one person!"
3510,What a crazy dream! Maybe your brain is trying to tell you it's time to settle down.
3510,"That's a possibility I guess!  Who knows!  She IS really nice, and I don't know why no one seems to like her"
3510,Who knows! People are strange. What kind of company do you work foer
3510,"I work for an employment agency.  Actually, our desks are right next to each other so I see her a lot."
3510,"Who cares what everyone else thinks, maybe you should ask her to hang out sometime."
3510,"You know, I just might!  I just hope I don't get anymore of those bizarre dreams!  Or at least dream about something different!"
3510,Hopefully not!
3510,"I've had bizarre dreams my whole life, but never about marrying someone.  It's kind of unsettling.  LOL"
3510,I don't believe we are supposed to remember our dreams so don't feel too bad. Scientists don't even fully understand the purpose of why we have dreams.
3511,I guess that'
3511,I love reading some of the classics from Arthur C. Clarke and the like. Grew up on those stories...
3511,"Sorry, I was typing so fast I accidently hit enter.  I guess that's why they call it SciFi"
3511,Yup. People used to be surprised when I'd mentioned liking science fiction. Especially these days with tons of movies/TV shows based on it.
3511,"Authur Charles was a notable writer.  Remember ""Space Odyssey?"""
3511,"2001, right? That really changed things, along with the sequels. :)"
3511,Yup 2001 it was.  One of the most prolific films in the industry.  
3511,"Heh, when you write a book that's made into a movie, and both of them become used in school as examples of literature, you know you've done well!"
3511,Exactly my thoughts.  Very successful.  Especially if one can still talk about it after being dead for so long.  You know that was a legacy.
3511,"Agreed. Clarke, Bradbury, and Asimov were among the most influential writers back then and still now- all Sci-fi."
3511,"Okay, I forgot about that."
3511,Some of Asimov's most interesting stories fit on a postcard. I haven't found many authors that can do that well.
3512,"I love the bible, it's my favorite book. Do you love it?"
3512,"I should say yes, but I haven't read my bible in years."
3512,I read it every week. I should probably read more but my jewelry designing keeps me busy in my spare time.
3512,That's neat. What sort of jewelry?
3512,"Mostly made from found items, rocks, sea shells, metals of different kinds. What are your hobbies?"
3512,Can being a vegetarian be considered a hobby? I love learning about nutrition.
3512,"Yes it can! I love nutrition, too. I'm always worried about my eating habits. What's your favorite vegetable?"
3512,I. Love. Peas. I can eat bowls of peas. What's your fav?
3512,"I like peas with mashed potatoes. But my favorite vegetables is spinach I think, or mushrooms. Hard to decide!"
3513,oh okay. i think i'd like to try it sometime. 
3513,oh yes what is your favorite drink with caffeine?
3513,I drink lots of coffee drinks. I like caramel macchiato
3513,oh my favorite! Do you go to Starbucks?
3513,every once in a while. my favorite place is local. Its small but has great coffee and food
3513,oh those are the best! I love supporting small business especially restaurants! I love food lol
3513,yeah me too. I love to travel as well - but its mainly to eat and drink lol
3513,yes everytime i travel back to my Island (Dominican Republic) All I do is eat
3513,I've been to the Dominican Republic - great time and great food. I could live there. 
3513,Me too! When was the last time you visited?
3513,in July. I went with some friends. It was a great time. Wish we had longer than a week
3513,lol yes a week is never enough i am going in July with my family where did you go 
3514,"My brother was in the navy and I always worried about him, so I prayed for his safety every day"
3514,What kind of job does he have in the military?
3514,He was a cook on one of the battle ships.  I sent my favorite mashed potato recipe with him and he says the crew loved it!
3514,i am thankful for his service . i wish i could send him some fried chicken .
3514,"It would have been a good accompaniment for the mashed potatoes! I LOVE mashed potatoes, and fried chicken goes great with them"
3514,This is true! Although I can't eat it as much these days as it packs on a lot of the ol' LBs
3514,"Yeah, it's too bad there are so many calories in mashed potatoes, and the gravy too!  It's not fair!  LOL"
3514,Lol you are right on that. Deep friend things is just cooking submerged in hot fat! It don't sound too appetizing putting it that way
3514,"Ugh, no it doesn't!  But after just one bite I am hooked!  I have to eat the whole thing!"
3514,that's what I say while I eat it lol
3514,haha!  Just eat some veggies to balance it all out!
3514,I'm going to substitue dijon because its what I've got.
3515,Haha you guessed it! More money to build my Barbie collection!
3515,That's an interesting hobby. I've thought about taking up skydiving in the future. 
3515,Oh exciting!! What about skydiving interests you?
3515,"I just like different things. I like gardening too, when I'm not on the road with my band."
3515,Those are certainly varied interests. I would love to travel on tour.
3515,It can get old being away from home. So how many Barbies do you have?
3515,True. I have about 150! I have loved them since I was a little girl!
3515,That must be worth a bundle! Could you ever sell them?
3515,"Oh maybe some of them, but some are special! I'm sure you feel that way about your instruments?"
3515,Absolutely. That's why I asked. It's hard to sell things because you get attached to them.
3515,"Yes, especially when you've had them for so long"
3515,It sounds like something nice to share with your kids.
3516,"I hear ya, a person gets out of shape slowly and gets in shape slowly. It's hard to stay focused."
3516,You're right. I suppose it's all about taking little baby steps consistently.
3516,Yeah every step counts but the steps are so small that it's easy to forget what you are trying to do (lose weight in my case like all Americans).
3516,Yeah. And I get discouraged when I don't see immediate results. Need to take the long view I guess. 
3516,I hear ya. That's really it. You have to be long term and really want it too. Have to have a good reason else the pizza gets me :)
3516,hahah for me it's french fries. I love those things even more than chocolate!
3516,Yeah french fires are a disaster lol Too much oil of course. Little oil is ok though.
3516,Yeah that's true. They are just my fav. I've already favored salty foods more than sweet. 
3516,"Do you use the original Heinz by chance with sugar, ketchup I mean. French fries and ketchup ya know go together."
3516,I usually by Hunt's ketchup instead of Heinz actually. 
3516,Ahh yes Hunts is good too. I wonder if Hunts has a sugar ketchup. They are all corn syrup now days which I'm kind of down on.
3516,Hmmm I don't know! That's a great question. I'll have to look at options next time I'm at the grocery store.
3517,The lottery?  What would you do if you win?
3517,I would drop out of college and do nothing! And you?
3517,I open a homeless facility for women and children.
3517,"That's a really great thing to do. I am selfish! I'd give some to charity, too. Maybe for nut allergies since I'm allergic to nuts!"
3517,That's a good idea.  I would also take care of my aging parents.
3517,How old are they?
3517,My mom is in her sixties and my dad is in his seventies.  
3517,"Hopefully they live long, still! Is your mother retired?"
3517,They're both retired.  Some people win the lottery and go broke again. 
3517,A lot of people go broke again. They think large sums of money are endless. You can go through money very quickly. What's the most expensive thing you want?
3517,They have no wisdom.  I want to own my own restaurant.
3517,What kind of restaurant?
3517,An upscale Caribbean Cuisine restaurant
3518,I didnt know that. I just know they taste good lol
3518,"There are indeed many ways to prepare them, and now after selective breeding, there are also a thousand different types of potatoes as well!"
3518,Wow. I would have never guessed that. 
3518,"And the potato is the world's fourth-largest food crop, so there is lots for everyone!"
3518,Very nice. How do you know so much about potatoes?
3518,It's something a family told me about. Small portions of healthy food and exercise.
3518,I see. I need to work on my diet a bit honestly.
3518,What diet do you want to do?
3518,"Just a healthier one. Im not fat or anything but geting older, you know."
3518,i understand that. im fat and getting older
3518,"lol. Well i figured with all the knowledge you have, you would know what to do."
3518,I try to diet but it does not work.
3519,cool. do you play live anywhere? I love live music
3519,yeah i live with some of my band mates
3519,nice. I can't play but I do dance. I have won some competitions in the past. 
3519,Cool! What type of competitions did you compete in?
3519,all kinds but I am great at tap and jazz dance. I teach as well
3519,I don't think I could ever teach. Just isn't my thing.
3519,yeah you  have to have the right mind set for it. especially with kids. 
3519,I could maybe work with adults. Kids seem too all over the place for me.
3519,it takes patience. anyhow its a living. I do make a nice living teaching. 
3519,I wish my music made a living. I end up working odd jobs here and there when gigs are down.
3519,well do what you gotta do until you make it big. good luck with it. I know how hard it can be
3519,Enjoying what you do is the most important thing in my opinion.
3520,Yes. I spent as much time with hobbies like fishing and leisurely walks to try and cope.
3520,I am sorry to hear that.I am sure he is in a better place.
3520,Agreed. And now it's better to enjoy the company of friends and family. Much less depressing.
3520,i agree . I am glad you have people to help you out in this difficult moment. 
3520,"Yes, it's great to have them around. Of course I still enjoy nature and solo activities. How about you?"
3520,I love  to travel. I have been in many places already.
3520,International travel?
3520,Yes. I am planning on going to Hawaii next month. Do you travel?
3520,Not recently. But I've been to lots of places in the US. Never been to Hawaii though I've heard that it's fantastic there.
3520,"It is..  it is for work that I am going, but I am panning on taking a couple of extra days to enjoy it. "
3520,It would be tragic if you didn't take those extra days! Good if those days are at the end of the trip so you know your way around.
3520,"Hahahahaha... sure!! Besides solo activities, what else do you like to do??"
3521,That's fascinating! What's your favourite Italian dish?
3521,"Lasagna or Tortellini with meat. It's really hard to say, they're both amazing. How about yours?"
3521,When I'm not looking after my figure I enjoy a nice pesto penne dish.
3521,That's a great choice! I cook that for my nieces and they say I'm the world's best aunt! Do you exercise a lot?
3521,"Yeah I do, I have to get at least 6 hours a week to stay in shape for my job!"
3521,What sort of work do you do?
3521,"I work as a ballet dancer, it's been my dream job since I was a kid. What do you work as?"
3521,I'm a financial analyst and a night-time musician which is also my dream job! Ballet sounds awesome. How long have you been doing it?
3521,Those jobs sound very fun! I've been going to practice since I was around 8 and I started doing it professionally when I was 19.
3521,Cool! I've been playing music for 30 years. Even with a full-time job and being a full-time aunt. What music is your favorite?
3521,"I'm a big fan of hip-hop music, my favorite artist is Kanye West. What's your favorite type of music?"
3521,I love rock but hip hop too. Especially Biggie!
3522,Yes. I playing pool and poker.
3522,I love playing online poker - I work at home for an online company and with 2 monitors I can play poker and work at the same time
3522,That sounds fun. Which site do you play on?
3522,"Usually Poker Stars, I find that one to be the best.  Where do you like to play poker?"
3522,Poker stars as well. Its definitely my favorite too.
3522,"I like to enter their tournaments, though as a soccer mom I am sometimes too busy to enter all the ones that I would like"
3522,I hear you. The tournaments can take quite a bit of time to complete if you do well.
3522,"It does take a long time to finish the rounds, but it's certainly a lot of fun if I win!"
3522,Thats the truth. Soccer mom huh? How is that like?
3522,"I love it, being a mom is the best!  It's a lot of running around though, with games and practices!"
3522,How many children do you have?
3522,"two , and they keep me busy every single day . how about you ?"
3523,Do you fish?
3523,I do! I love going out to the wild to catch em! Where do you usually fish?
3523,I don't fish.  I don't even like going on waters lol
3523,"Hmm, that's interesting. So you don't like catching other animals like mollusks or crabs?"
3523,"Nope, but I'll eat the crab and the fishes.  I'm scared of being on water.  Traumatic experience."
3523,Definitely scary. Do you have a favorite shellfish to eat? Like oysters or clams or octopus or lobster?
3523,lobster any day.
3523,"i love lobster, crab oysters all of the sea food."
3523,I don't like all sea food.  My son loves seafood.
3523,A lot of people have allerges to sea food.
3523,"Sorry, I have a friend who is allergic to sea food as well.  Always needs time when we go to restaurants."
3523,I am not allergice to sea food thankfully. I am allergic to strawberries though.
3524,No I was so mad I just left! Probably my fault for not pursuing it. Just some local band.
3524,Oh I'm sorry to hear that. ny hobby or anything to do instead? I make soap
3524,No I'm quite boring I think haha. Soap sounds interesting though! Do you have a favorite type?
3524,Goat milk soap. I am a fruitatarian so I really like natural fruit scents toit
3524,I have never heard of a fruitatarian. Do you only eat fruit?
3524,Yes.
3524,How did you reach that decision?
3524,"some fruitarians only eat fruit that has already fallen from a tree or plant, so they don't actually harm the tree itself"
3524,"I suppose I've never thought of that. Maybe I'm just ignorant, I have been in the past."
3524,Not at all. What kind of concert were you supposed to see? Genre?
3524,It was a rock concert! So disappointed to miss but maybe next time. Have you seen anything lately?
3524,I have not but have some tickets for next weekend
3525,"Radioactive sounds familiar, but I mostly listen to country music."
3525,"Country music used to good, then I went to an Imagine Dragons concert. "
3525,What did you like so much about the concert?
3525,"Well I play the electric violin as a hobby, and they use the same model I have in some of their insrtrumentals"
3525,"How long have you been playing?  I have always wanted to play a musical instrument, but never learned."
3526,I also love watching cake decorating shows where they have them use odd ingredients or sculpt using things like pumpkin.
3526,oh i love to bake! I like making cakes but i;m not a professional at all
3526,I don't it often but when I do always from scratch. I always like making things from nothing.
3526,oh i love making things from scratch but i am not good at making the frosting from scratch how about you
3526,I tried to make frosting from scratch when I made some cupcakes for my coworker. Didn't go well and had to use store bought for it.
3526,oh no! I do that all the time but you know practice makes perfect
3526,I need to look up some more recipes before my next attempt for sure.
3526,I can't wait for Christmas its the best time to work
3526,I like everything about working around Christmas except for the the time it takes for me to be able to ignore the music. Too much repetition in songs.
3526,LOL yes after about a week of it I am done with the songs lol
3526,The worst is when they start the day after Halloween
3526,LOL I am ready for Christmas but i can wait a few more weeks
3527,I'm hoping shopping at a farm stand might be good for my health. Seems vegetables are not what they used to be in the grocery store.
3527,usually the local farmers market is a great place to find locally sourced veggies and other foods. Have you tried shopping there?
3527,No actually not but that's a real good idea. Seems some veggies not what they used to be I guess.
3527,"I don't know, my parents buy mine since I still live at home, but they seem to find good ones. What's your favorite vegetable?"
3527,"Cauliflower probably, very versatile and steams real well. Great with butter. How about yours?"
3527,"Interesting! No one ever picks cauliflower! I'm all about the mushrooms. Spinach is wonderful, too. Have you ever tried creamy spinach?"
3527,Mushrooms are very good indeed. I'm actually more about what goes on the salad. Just love blue cheese. Marie's Blue Cheese. Yum and so fattening
3527,Oh yes I love cheese. Manchego is my most favorite. Do you play video games?
3527,Oh yeah definitely here and there. Anything with good action I like.
3527,Me too! I play games all day. How long have you been playing for?
3527,"Oh man, I go back to Windows 95 lol. Actually I'm pretty old school :) I play but not that often."
3527,I go back to windows 3.1! LOL! 
3528,I'm kinda new to the surfing scene. What would you recommend?
3528,"Well, suitable waves are usually found in oceans, but you can also try in lakes and rivers for practice.  I love surfing, and I bet you would too!"
3528,"I'm a skater, but I'm not too sure how well that would transfer to surfing. I'd really like to try it though."
3528,"Skating involves balance, just like surfing, so you'd probably do well at it"
3528,I can't wait to go back to the coast again. The thing I miss the most about it is the Italian food. There's nothing like it here
3528,I was at an Italian restaurant yesterday - kept getting asked for autographs because I'm a reality tv star.  
3528,"Wow, really? I'd be pretty annoyed if someone interrupted me all the time while I was just trying to eat my favorite pizza"
3528,"Well, it goes with the territory I guess, but it does make it difficult to eat in peace sometimes!"
3528,"What;s your opinion on pineapple on pizza? As a pizza connoisseur, I can't stand it "
3528,"I like it by itself, but not on pizza. That's so gross!  Fruit on pizza just isn't right!"
3528,"I mean, tomato is a fruit, right?"
3528,"True, but most people think of it as a vegetable - pineapple is 100% fruit!  And it doesn't belong on pizza!  LOL"
3528,Good chat moviestar guy. Maybe I'll order a delivery pizza in bit
3529,No kidding? No wonder it taste so good.
3529,"Yeah. In 1886, American cooks began adding chocolate to the cake batter"
3529,I knew it! Americans rarely create something that the French have not perfected yet.
3529,or afircan amercians.
3529,"Well, on any given day, I prefer chocolate cake to any other flavor. What's your favorite?"
3529,red velvet with cream cheese frosting or a turtle dove cheese cake
3529,"Ah, but definitely a chocolate fan, I see. "
3529,i had the turtle dove on my annivsary for the first time and i looked at my husband like is this what i have been missing
3529,"Awww. That's sweet. I don't really have much time for family, much less dating, though. I work a lot."
3529,work life balance is hard to find but everyone has to try or you cant live a healthy life
3529,That's true. Where do you work again?
3529,"i am a stay at home mom, i did try working but my check went to childcare and transportation so it was pointless."
3529,Working at home is a very important job. I respect that.
3530,"Yes, it good to have one."
3530,"Yeah, what do you do in your spare time?"
3530,I love cooking and hanging out with my boys.
3530,That sounds lovely; I like going to the salon and getting a nice manicure
3530,"Yes, that's my therapy.  I love going to do my nails every two weeks."
3530,Haha! It became part of my routine because my mom would take me every month before my beauty paegants
3530,"Oh, beauty paegants.  What was that like for you?"
3530,I don't really remember much as I was very young but it was good because I was able to bond with my mom!
3530,My sons love bonding with me as well.  That's sweet though
3530,"That's really sweet, how old are they?"
3530,16 & 17.  Awesome young men
3530,"I'm sure they are, hope they turn out to be lovely men"
3531,2 years it's still feels like it just happened
3531,It always does. My mom passed away the day before a big dance competition I had and I remember it fresh every time I dance.
3531,oh no i am so sorry loosing our parents always so hard
3531,We knew it was coming for a long time. The slow decline of cancer doesn't have the sudden shock of something unexpected but is draining.
3531,oh no i totally understand! Cancer is the worst! Loosing my father during my last year of high school made me grow up fast
3531,It is something everyone must go through. Sometimes sooner than they should.
3531,yes unfortunately sometimes it comes too fast
3531,Sometimes doing something you used to enjoy together helps. For me it is Disney movies.
3531,oh i love Disney! I'm a big fan of everything disney
3531,My preference is the original animated. It was perfect the first time around.
3531,yes though i did love some of the remakes now
3531,I still haven't seen the new Aladdin or Lion King
3532,Well thats me. It was hard growing up without siblings but at least I was able to focus on my ballet.
3532,Do you still do ballet 
3532,"Yes, I dance professionally! Do you have any hobbies?"
3532,"Yes, I play soccer"
3532,Oh that's fun. My parents were strict with my ballet lessons so I never explored another sport.
3532,Well lucky me get to explore basketball and sometimes football 
3532,You are a regular all-star haha! But soccer is your favorite?
3532,"Me too, and i also watch it"
3532,So did you grow up with siblings or are you an only child as well?
3532,I wish i was but no i grew up with 3 sisters and a brother
3532,wow that's a big family! I can see how it may have been difficult.
3532,Difficult not really tho it was kinda fun lol
3533,I am in college and I mostly use it to drive back and forth to classes.
3533,Oh cool. What kind of truck is it?
3533,Its a Ford F250.  Got it when my family drove to the beach a few summers ago.  We love going to the beach.
3533,Cool. I like going out too. I hate working long hours. Do you live near a beach?
3533,"No I live in Texas, but we go to Florida every year with the family.  "
3533,Always warm! I'm in Canada and we just had an election. I love to vote! And my guy won so I'm happy. How do you feel about your next election?
3533,"Mixed emotions.  I know who I will vote for, but im growing tired of politics in general."
3533,Politics can be tiresome at times but democracy is important. What part of Texas are you in?
3533,Dallas/Ft Worth Area.  Had some tornadoes come through last weekend.
3533,Oh that's terrible! I hope everything is ok! Are you a fan of the Dallas Stars?
3533,Not really a big hockey fan. Followed them closely when they had their Stanley cup runs in the 90s. This is a football town. 
3533,I understand. Cowboys all the way!
3534,"True, but finding a good one with little cheese? I found a fresh tomato pizza which was awesome, but just in one place."
3534,I've never heard of a pizza without cheese! My wife likes it without cheese sometimes though. She tries to watch her weight and cheese is fattening.
3534,"Agreed, but bread doesn't help either lol. It'd be easier to cut out other things like soda (I've done that) and chocolate (I'll never do that!) ;)"
3534,Chocolate-that would be impossible to give up! But pizza is really my favorite- I could never give that up. Maybe vegetables though ;)
3534,"Lol. You're supposed to have more veggies, not less. Eating properly is difficult sometimes..."
3534,"It's hard to eat healthy, don't you think?  Trying to balance the right nutrients and eat things that taste good can be another challenge."
3534,"Depends on what you enjoy eating though. I've found Quinoa to be tasty and a great substitute for rice, but I know people who won't try it."
3534,"My wife is really into those. She used to teach and bring that stuff to school, but I can only eat it every now and then."
3534,"I prefer it when covered in whatever I'd be eating rice with- like Chinese food, or my homemade chili!"
3534,"Chili? I love chili. Do you usually use beef or turkey? I've heard that turkey chili is actually pretty tasty, so I'd like to give it a try!"
3534,I tried ground turkey but didn't notice any taste difference. These days I dice up boneless skinless chicken to go in it. Meaty and healthier.
3534,"That sounds pretty good. I grew up eating a lot of beef, but I've recently heard that's bad for you so I've been trying to eat less."
3534,I limit my beef to steak or REALLY good burgers if I'm going to eat red meat. Hmm I should try 'whole' turkey in my chili instead of ground.
3535,I didn't know that wolves had ever been domesticated.
3535,I suspect that all modern dogs are ancestral to these taxa. I'm a fan of taxonomy. And also dogs.
3535,"I'm a cat person.  I've got a 15-year-old cat named Charlie.  It's hard to leave a dog alone while you work, but cats adapt easily."
3535,Well I don't actually HAVE a dog. I want one but I'm not big on making that kind of long term commitment.
3535,"It really IS a commitment, isn't it?  And it's expensive, too, when you consider food, shots, etc."
3535,No kidding. It really cramps my ability to buy what I want when I want. Maybe I'm selfish? I bet cats are easier to deal with.
3535,"Cats are a bit easier, I think, but if you want to travel, you have to board them, and that's expensive."
3535,Do you travel a lot? That sounds enjoyable.
3535,I love to travel and especially enjoyed Ireland.
3535,I've always wanted to go to Ireland. My ancestors are from there. Have you been recently?
3535,"Yes.  I like to fly into Shannon, rent a car, and stay in bed & breakfasts."
3535,That sounds lovely. I hope I can do something similar eventually!
3536,that is neat
3536,"Freelancer, that's interesting"
3536,"definetly, you get to make your own rules"
3536,I hired a freelancer a few weeks ago to create a logo for me.  
3536,how is that going for you?
3536,The logo was well done.  What is your expertise?
3536,"hair since mine is so long, i have to know how to style it"
3536,Do you have natural hair?
3536,sure do
3536,That's good.  Do you ever cut it?
3536,no even though people say i should since i am a boy
3536,Oh okay.  Does your hair grow quickly?
3537,"I'm just a freshman at nyu right now, but I'm studying technology.  How about you?"
3537,"Ah, that sounds like a great field these days. I'm too old to go back, but would go if I knew I would get promoted."
3537,You're never too old!  Don't even think that!  What kind of promotion do you think you would get if you went back?
3537,"Lol, probably something with less driving, hopefully. Right now I drive more hours than I have time at the end of the day."
3537,"Sometimes I think I would like to be a seamstress. I could work at home and sew clothes all day. Blue clothes, since that's my favorite color!"
3537,"Awww, blue is very calming and makes people feel relaxed. It's my favorite, too. "
3537,"Yep, my whole wardrobe is blue!  Other colors just don't do it for me!"
3537,That's awesome. I like a variety. My clothes are usually the colors of the rainbow. 
3537,That sound pretty!  Rainbow colors are beautiful!  Just not on me!  LOL
3537,"Well, everyone has different flattering colors. You must have a lighter complexion. I'm a pinkish toned person."
3537,"That makes sense - yes, I do have a lighter complexion.  But anyway, for now I'm studying technology.  I might switch to something else though, who knows"
3537,"What would you major in, given a different choice?"
3538,"I love supernatural. I hope I can finish the series soon, my doctor says I only have six months left to live"
3538,What is it about? The Supernatural?
3538,It's all about characters with strange super powers
3538,I love super naturals. Do you 
3538,Indeed I do! Anything creepy and unusual is quite interesting to me
3538,Great. What about tattoos. Do you have any 
3538,I have one of a lyric by Justin Beiber. He's my favorite artist. You?
3538,I hate Justin Bieber. 
3538,Whos your favorite artist?
3538,i am not sure really . yours ?
3538,justin beiber! a close second would be one direction
3538,Wow. What do you do for a living?
3539,like a picture or her name?
3539,"Haha it's an angel, more like a symbol for her. I also have a rose tattoo on my ankle."
3539,"that's cool, I thought about getting something on my ankle"
3539,You should do it! Any ideas for specifics?
3539,maybe an anchor
3539,That could be very symbolic. Or are you involved in the maritime industry?
3539,I'm not but both my grandpas were in the navy
3539,That's great. My father was in the Army but I'm studying to be a dental hygienist. Just have to get over my saliva phobia!
3539,a saliva phobia? 
3539,It's just gross. I don't know why it bothers me so much.
3539,i mean... it is pretty gross. what mad e you want to be a dental hygenist?
3539,I like to think I could help people. Plus it is in high demand in my area. What do you do?
3540,"That's so interesting. They are the weirdest creatures. We always see dead ones. Morbid, I know."
3540,"Since I live in FL so I see them often.  I don't mind, since I love animals"
3540,"Awww, do you work with animals?"
3540,I do!  I work at an animal rescue organization.  And I've decided to become a vegetarian because of my work with animals
3540,"Kudos! I wish I could say the same. I work in the healthcare field for humans, lol. Although sometimes it's a zoo."
3540,That sounds interesting!  How long have you been doing that?
3540,"I think I've been working at the hospital for 13 years, now. How time flies!"
3540,Wow. That's a long time. Congrats!  I've been at the animal rescue for only 4 years
3540,I'm glad you have followed your passion. : )
3540,"Thanks, animal rights are an important thing and I feel that I'm doing my part for their welfare"
3540,"Yes, I think you are helping them tremendously."
3540,They deserve it. They are so innocent.  Do you have any pets?
3540,I do. A chihuahua and a lizard.
3541,Teenagers now! 16 and 13. I refuse to accept they are all grown up
3541,You still have a few years yet to shape them and watch them grow. I'm sure it's fun as well as frustrating at times.
3541,It is! especially with my career I don't get to spend as much time with them as I'd like.
3541,What do you do? Is it something you enjoy?
3541,I am a basketball player! plus 35 Mil a year doesn't hurt. What do you do?
3541,Wow! That's awesome. I show movies at a vintage theater. It's not as exciting as basketball but I enjoy it.
3541,"Oh I love that theatre! as long as you enjoy it, that is all that matters."
3541,It really is something I appreciate. Doing something I love is important to me. Plus the snacks are fantastic!
3541,Me too! I am thinking of retiring soon and it is going to be sad.
3541,I imagine that is a downside to playing professional sports. The plus side will be you'll have more time with your kids though right?
3541,Oh that's so true. Good point. Ill get to enjoy them before they move out and go to college. 
3541,Yep. Enjoy that time while you can. It flies by. They'll be in a dorm before you know it.
3542,Some of both since he's an ex. Mostly wistful ones.
3542,Good to hold on to those memories.  Good or bad we learn from them and use them to guide future decision making.
3542,Very true. You seem wise and perceptive.
3542,Thanks. I guess I am old enough now to give a little advice from time to time.  
3542,With age comes that wisdom. Unfortunately there are lots of people who don't appreciate that kind of experience.
3542,Its so true.  I wish I could have time back with my grandparents.  I missed out on so much free wisdom.  
3542,*nods* I've spoken to people who were alive around the time of the depression and WWII. It's amazing.
3542,"They were truly the most amazing generation.  Proud, patriotic, and brave generation that had so much less than we did."
3542,"Agreed. I'm standing astride the time when we didn't even have electric typewriters, and now where everything is so immediate. It's mindbending though I obviously like computers. ;)"
3542,Full circle - They had their children and husbands drafted into a war and here we are talking about smelling ex's perfume.  
3542,"Very much so! But I'm looking forward to the future now rather than clinging to that past. History is one thing, personal history another."
3542,"Agreed on that point.  Future is bright, but lets not forget where we came from and lessons learned.  "
3543,"Yeah, but does the animals has rights for us?"
3543,I believe that animals have many of the same basic rights that humans do.
3543,How so?
3543,"Animals, like humans, should not be abused without right."
3543,"If you had the right, it's okay to abuse?"
3543,"If an animal or human is abusing you, you have the right to abuse them back."
3543,Sometimes animals are not abused only if they're put in the wrong environment.
3543,"I work in finance, so I don't see too many animals on a daily basis."
3543,"Oh okay, corporate america?"
3543,Yeah it's fun but they always try to get me to drink coffee with them. I hate coffee.
3543,"Oh, that's to bad. "
3543,"I sometimes drink it just to fit in, but I really hate the acidic taste."
3544,The Lion King. It was really good.
3544,it was an awesome movie!  I've seen it three times already!
3544,"The graphics were super detailed, and I thought it was a pretty good remake. Have you seen anything new lately?"
3544,"No, I haven't. I've been focusing more on taking walks down by the park.  I love the quiet and solitude"
3544,Walks are really good for you. I love walking around my complex when I can.
3544,"I find it relaxing.  I'm a professional gamer and I get so wound up sometimes, and walking helps calm me down"
3544,"Wow, what is that like? I bet it can be really fun."
3544,"it can be intense , but fun . what do you like to do for fun ?"
3544,"I like to shoot hoops with my sister. We have a game where whoever wins, takes the other out for pizza once a month."
3544,that sounds like fun . what is your favorite kind of pizza?
3544,I prefer mushroom and black olives. What's yours?
3544,"I prefer Chicago Deep Dish Pizza.  It is so good, I could eat it every day!"
3544,"Sounds like it's really good. I've never tried Chicago pizza, actually."
3545,Collies are fantastic! Do you have one?
3545,My favorite is golden retriever.
3545,Those are really popular. I think almost everyone has one growing up.
3545,Not me
3545,You just enjoy everyone else's then?
3545,Growing up in the Islands dogs were mostly used as securities.
3545,Here in the states we keep them for lots of different reasons. My Collie is just a pet. She is spoiled.
3545,Are Collies active?
3545,"Yes, they can be. They are extremely smart. Everyone remembers Lassie from TV. "
3545,"Yes, I remember Lassie.  I loved that movie."
3545,It makes me nostalgic to think of it. Are there other shows or movies about dogs you enjoyed?
3545,Is yours trained?
3545,Not professionally. But she can be taught to do lots of things. She minds pretty well. 
3546,"A wake board is like a surf board, but you stay close to the shore."
3546,Oh wow! I am so uncoordinated I wish I could do stuff like that. Are you learning alone?
3546,I've got a friend showing me how to do it. Although I should be working on my homework instead!
3546,that a good friend. I totally feel you. I've been binge watching grey's anatomy but just started taking some college classes and have a lot of homework.
3546,"I used to watch Grey's Anatomy all the time, but then just slowly stopped watch it."
3546,could not stop watching the show . its addictive . threw me off my schedule. I can't believe the show Is still going on. What do you watch?
3546,"Lately I started watching Carnival Row, the new show with Orlando Bloom."
3546,Ive never heard of it! What Is it about?
3546,"Its on Amazon Prime, set in Victorian England except there is magic and pixies. Its interesting."
3546,Sounds interesting. I will have to check it out.
3546,Its hard to find good fantasy themed TV shows now that Game of Thrones is over.
3546,I AGREE!! I miss game of thrones. though the last season was not the best.
3547,Where will you go?
3547,Kazakhstan. she is going to visit her parents
3547,Wonderful!. Have you been?
3547,"Unfortunatly not, what are your interests anyway?"
3547,Oh I love fishing and scuba diving.
3547,"Sounds like fun, you must see really interesting things"
3547,When the water is clear it's amazing. I touched an octopus once.
3547,Id be so scared scuba diving. Arent you ever worried a shark will bite you?
3547,Sometimes. Do you know a lot about sharks since you are a trivia star and all?
3547,"Not really actually, im more into pop culture and geography."
3547,That makes sense. That geography will come in handy during your travels.
3547,"Yeah it is, i just think learning about different cultures is really facinating."
3548,What do you like to do as a hobby if you don't read?
3548,"I love to watch his movies, just not read the books. I just prefer them I guess. You?"
3548,"I can understand that. I really love to cook. So, I like to have the tv on sometimes when I'm sauteing things."
3548,The food network definitely inspires me to cook!
3548,Oh really? I think Gordon Ramsey is sort of mean sometimes. I prefer Giada.
3548,I like the competition shows. Did you parents foster your love of cooking?
3548,"Well, my Dad did. Haha, my mom was sort of a clean freak and didn't like the counters being so messy."
3548,My parents both worked in politics so they were really unpleasant to be around. I was so relieved when they quit.
3548,"That must have been stressful on you, as well. My mom has gotten a lot better with age."
3548,"Yes, I think as we age we tend to start focusing on the things that matter. My parents did at least."
3548,That's so true! I'm happier now than I was ten years ago.
3548,That is great! I am still getting there!
3548,You will! : )
3548,Thank you!
3549,"Awesome. I work at a coffee shop, I love my job and you?"
3549,"I run a small business, it's pretty great!"
3549,Good. My favorite color is red. What's yours?
3549,"Oh cool, I like red too, always have! Maybe we're a lot alike!"
3549,Right. Is your business difficult to control?
3549,"Nah, it's just me and a couple friends. I know they say you shouldn't work with your friends, but it works out for us."
3549,It's good to have people you know working with you. Do you miss your full time job in a company?
3549,"Not at all, it was pretty horrible working for someone else. I need freedom, it helps me be a more creative person."
3549,Has it been difficult for you to be organized errands with your family while running a business? 
3549,"Oh, yeah, kinda. It's hard to balance things with so much going on. Business is always on my mind, you know?"
3549,I see. What type of business do you have?
3549,"We contract out and do murals and other kinds of installation art for companies. It's pretty rad, constantly get to make things."
3550,"I certainly seems that way.  I always wonder if the times were better or I just had no responsibilities, so life was all about enjoying being a kid."
3550,"I still live at home with my ada, my brother is there too. It feels good to not have many responsibilities for now."
3550,"Well, enjoy it while you can.  Of course you will eventually move away, possibly have a family, and start paying alot in taxes.  "
3550,I am definitely not ready to pay taxes. I want to enjoy my financial freedoms as long as possible.
3550,"Amen.  Being on your own and having a family is great.  Adulting hits you hard though, you learn alot,  you become more conservative.  "
3550,Yeah I bet! For now im just focused on school and my full-time job though.
3550,"You do both?  Good for you.  You finish school while working a full-time, there is nothing you cant do.  Impressive."
3550,"I have to pay for tuition somehow, tuition costs are outrageous."
3550,Yes they are.  You could have taken out a loan and spent a majority of your young career paying it off.  You are doing it right.
3550,Loans ruin peoples life. We need to think of ways as a country to lower tuition costs.
3550,Stop throwing out unlimited loans to students. Thats why they raise tuition They know students will just take out more to go there.
3550,"Well im working day in and day out just to stay awa from loans, its tough. "
3551,I don't really understand the difference but I enjoy praise and worship music
3551,"Ever since I was a boy, I've loved George Strait. "
3551,Yes he is one of the greats. What is your favorite song?
3551,Check Yes or No has got to be just about the best one he's every done. What's yours?
3551,Amarillo by Morning maybe? Love to imagine the beautiful west Texas sunrise. That shade of red is my favorite color.
3551,I listened to that on the radio in my truck on the way home from work the other day. 
3551,"Oh, what do you do as a job?"
3551,I collect water samples from riverbeds. It's really interesting stuff.
3551,That does sound interesting! Wouldn't be great for me - I'm literally all thumbs (I have 3!). 
3551,"Oh. Well, now, there's lots of things you could do with that. I imagine you could tickle the keys if you had a hankering. Ever tried bluegrass?"
3551,I could put it on my to do list!
3551,"I knew a guitarist who had fewer fingers, but boy he could play."
3552,That was a good show. 
3552,He was extremely talented. I'm not much of an artist but I enjoy watching him do it.
3552,I agree.  He is my favorite artist.  
3552,They had a marathon on Twitch recently. I would have liked to follow along and try to paint. 
3552,That would be a great idea. I wish I had known about it. I'm not much of a painter
3552,He had a soothing voice. Even if you don't paint it can be relaxing.
3552,"I agree.  Another thing I like to do that is relaxing, is hiking. "
3552,Indeed. It can be stimulating and refreshing. I really enjoy taking a book on the trail and finding a view to sit and read at.
3552,I enjoy the fresh air and exercise. I should take a book next time.
3552,You really should. Books are a good way to relax as well. 
3552,"I agree, thanks for the suggestion.  I know a trail with a scenic spot that would be perfect. "
3552,"Does it have ""happy little trees?"""
3552,Indeed it does. 
3553,I love the city of Seattle.
3553,I've never been to Seattle.
3553,It's great. Super bike friendly. Do you ride a bike?
3553,"Yes, I do.  "
3553,Same here. I actually am from Seattle. Probably why I like bikes so much. 
3553,"Wow, I'm in Georgia"
3553,Is Georgia very bike-friendly?
3553,"No, not really.  It's down south and many people drives.  "
3553,I see. What do you like to do for fun there?
3553,We have parks and fun areas here especially the GA Aquarium
3553,Very nice. Sounds like a fun place. Almost as fun as Seattle. 
3553,I actually relocated from Boston a few years ago.  
3554,"Yeah alot actually, i have a dog and hes really high energy"
3554,That sounds like a good way to have fun and get some exercise! What kind of dog do you have?
3554,"A border collie, hes ony a year and a half long so its hell on earth if he doesnt get exercise. The garden turns into a sand pit"
3554,How adorable! I have a yellow lab that used to be a handful but he's ten now so he's mellowed out.
3554,Nice! Do you have any hobbies?
3554,I play the drums and the ukulele and I like to listen to music! What about you?
3554,I love to shop and maticulously clean my car.
3554,I love shopping too! Where do you like to shop?
3554,"Anywhere thats a bit classy, and you?"
3554,"I like consignment stores where I can buy good quality, name-brand items at a lower price! Do you have any kids?"
3554,"No not yet, want to travel before i get any little devils"
3554,Me neither. I want to further my career and be more financially stable before I start a family.
3555,"I know, it's so depressing! At least I can keep my own pets safe and happy at home!"
3555,"I see road kill often, its sad. I hitchhike around town to save gas."
3555,"Yeah, that is sad! Hitchhiking can be dangerous, can't it? Hope you're careful out there!"
3555,I try to be. I'm currently saving for a better gas mileage vehicle though.
3555,"Good idea, mine is a gas guzzler. Just got back from the store, had to get some of my favorite chocolates. The gas prices are crazy!"
3555,They are getting pretty outrageous right! Everything seems to be getting more expensive.
3555,"Well, here's hoping the economy gets a little better soon. Important to do those little things to save, though. You're onto something, heh!"
3555,I dont see the economy getting any better in my opinion. 
3555,"I think you're right, but I try to stay hopeful! Good to be positive, even in bad situations."
3555,"Amen! So you mentioned you like chocolates earlier, whats your favorite?"
3555,"Oh, I LOVE anything with toffee in it! I could use one right now, hehe. Are you a chocolate lover?"
3555,I like heath bars! I think that those have toffee in them too.
3556,you drink at a salon while people are getting their hair done?
3556,Sure. It's a very social place and all my friends are there too. 
3556,I need my hair dyed blonde.  Its brown right now.
3556,Blonde is always a good color to have. Why do you want it to be brown?
3556,It's already brown.  I wish to dye it blonde.
3556,"Oh, sorry. I read that wrong. I was thinking of my French bulldog. His hair is blonde colored. "
3556,Do you have more than one pet?
3556,"No, just by bulldog. He is my constant companion. We go everywhere together. "
3556,I love dogs.  I have a pit bull named Ralph.
3556,"Cool name! Pit bulls can be nice dogs, but they won't allow them in my penthouse."
3556,Do you live in a tall building?
3556,"Yes, in New York City. Where do you live?"
3557,I really hope so. I need an A and I think I might have gotten it. 
3557,i don't think i did well.  i didnt study much
3557,That's unfortunate. Were you busy? 
3557,"No I was just lazy, listened to music all week."
3557,That's a great way to relax. I enjoy music when I am running.
3557,"I love that song Barbie Girl, lol."
3557,It's fantastic! Or something like that. We didn't get much radio on the farm so I don't know a lot of the popular stuff.
3557,Was it a big farm?  What did  you grow?
3557,My family were into cattle. I love the farm but hope school can lead me to more. Thus the need for an A.
3557,What do you want to do for a living after school?
3557,Anything but math! I enjoy biology. So maybe a doctor? I guess I could be a vet and help out with the animals. Something along those lines I guess.
3557,"Being a vet would be so rewarding, but difficult too."
3558,"Tennis to a high level, then squash and badminton for fun. What sports do you enjoy?"
3558,I don't actually sport. Haha. But I've always been an outcast. Sounds epic for sure.
3558,You should give something a try. Great for meeting new people. Lot's of shy people come to our sport club too.
3558,"Well, it's not that I'm shy. My sister and I are in a band. But I just don't enjoy the physicality of sports. Sporty people annoy me sometimes as well."
3558,Far enough. What type of music does your band play?
3558,"Some grunge, some punk. Mostly grunge. Love the stuff. You?"
3558,I'm not in a band but I like all sorts - Jazz and Classical is good for relaxing. 
3558,Funcakes. Our bass player is actually a classical guitarist. He can jam like crazy. It's good practice for him.
3558,Oh nice. That's pretty cool talented guy. One of my colleagues at the hospital is a classical guitarist too. Crazy talented. 
3558,Oh yeah? So what do you do for a living?
3558,Training to be a doctor. So student at the moment. 
3558,"Nice. Well, hit us up sometime if you're downtown. We play at the coffee house on Tuesday nights."
3559,Typical skydiving accident. Wasn't the first time. Have you ever gone skydiving?
3559,No I haven't. I think I would be too scared to try it.
3559,Understandable. Are you a fan of the Olympics?
3559,"I am not, but I do watch clips here and there. Do you like vintage cars?"
3559,"They're okay I guess. The Olympics are a big deal to me, more than cars. What else do you like to do?"
3559,"I like to work out and I am a food lover. I learned to limit my meat intake, I would like to try being a vegan for a week."
3559,"How interesting. Do you think that would be hard to do, since you love food?"
3559,"I think it's possible. It would be hard but for health reasons and just to help animals in general, its worth a try."
3559,"Yes, staying fit is very important."
3559,"Yes, it's good that people get fit. I also like to see people taking what they love to do and making a living out of it. It takes guts!"
3559,Totally agree. I used to love to run for fun--it actually got me an Olympic medal!
3559,"Wow, that's quite the honor! Good work man! I'm sure you were very proud of that."
3560,Thank you :]
3560,So what do you do for fun?
3560,Draw my latest character designs. 
3560,What kind of characters? Like animation or more realistic?
3560,More anime with a worldly blend.
3560,"Sound interesting, how long have you been doing that?"
3560,Give or take about 6 years lol. 
3560,Damn your really commited!
3560,Somewhat this stuff aint easy.
3560,How do you find inspiration or ideas? Does it come natural?
3560,My man character is a persona of my hidden cruelty
3560,Could you elaborate?
3560,I found out that it's easyer to base a character of ones other self.
3561,I recently graduated vet school!
3561,wow. that's cool. do you find it hard or enjoyable working with animals?
3561,It is hard in some ways but very rewarding. I love animals. What do you like about your job?
3561,That I get to leave work at work. It is a little greasy though. :)
3561,Yes haha I can imagine! What do you do outside of work?
3561,I enjoy playing football. what about you?
3561,I love to ride my bike. Exercise is so good for you.
3561,I agree. I really enjoy when I go for a run.
3561,So have you ever thought about going back to school?
3561,"no, I don't think you could drag me back. not my favorite time in life."
3561,My time was stressful as well. Vet students and vets actually have high rates for depression.
3561,"Is that like all medical (people are always sick), or particularly with vets?"
3562,Interesting. How long did the last one you do take?
3562,Probably about two weeks.  I put so many hours into it.
3562,That's great. What else do you like doing in your sparetime?
3562,I like to fish.  Have you ever been fishing?
3562,"Yes, as a child. I grew up on a large farm so we had lots of places to fish on the land."
3562,What's the biggest fish you caught?
3562,Rainbow trout - 400g
3562,Very nice.  Mine was a 16lb catfish.
3562,That's good. Do you do any sea fishing?
3562,No but I want to try.  You?
3562,No - I'm not great on boats so will likely fish from the beach. 
3562,"Yeah or you could fish from the pier.  That has to be exciting, never knowing what you're going to pull out of the ocean."
3562,"Oh definitely. So relaxing too. Sounds of the waves, fresh air. Can't beat it "
3563,"Sort of. She would watch those Bob Ross episodes. You know, the one's with ""happy little trees""."
3563,"Oh my gosh, yes! I loved watching him as a kid.!"
3563,Right? His voice was so soothing. I remember that vividly. 
3563,"Awww. My grandmother painted, but I don't think Mom ever liked it. That's so sweet that she paints."
3563,"Her trees were a bit ""abstract"". I have no talent for it either. I just remember her doing it with those shows and wanting to try."
3563,I think art can be therapeutic for many people. I've always enjoyed photography.
3563,That sounds like something that would make a fantastic hobby.
3563,"Well, my husband travels alot with his job, and I usually move about once every two years. So I started collecting photos of all the states."
3563,What's your favorite so far?
3563,Probably Wisconsin. That's the year that I got the perfect shot of a snowy field just as a buck was traveling across.
3563,That sounds perfect. You must have a good eye for it.
3563,Thank you! I've been tinkering with filters lately. Do you like to take photos?
3564,I suppose so. I try to be mindful of that. How is your day?
3564,Oh not bad. I've got to get to a soccer game later for my kids. My son really loves soccer.
3564,"How fun! I personally love hockey, but soccer is fun too. Is there a kids' hockey team in your area?"
3564,I believe there is one. I know that I have seen them practice at the YMCA. Have you ever played hockey?
3564,"Oh yeah, it's my favorite sport, along with doing yoga. How about you?"
3564,"I played basketball when I was in high school. I played center since I was so tall. Sadly, I gave it when I went to college."
3564,It's hard to keep playing sports in college. What did you study
3564,Environmental science. I've always been interested in nature and preserving it as much as we can. How about you? Did you go to college?
3564,We've only got one planet. It's important to preserve it. I studied psychology and researched memory failures. 
3564,"How interesting. If I hadn't taken environmental science, I would've studied psychology. It was a tough choice."
3564,"Yeah, it seems there were so many things I wanted to do. College was a fun time. "
3564,It really was. I have many good memories of my time in college. What career did you decide to go into?
3565,"interesting. do you live there, or just know fun facts about Alabama?"
3565,I grew up in Alabama but I'm currently living in Georgia. It's funny how I love Alabama but hate Sweet home Alabama song.
3565,lol. maybe you've heard it too many times. :)
3565,That's maybe it. I tend to get tired of some songs quickly. Do you like it?
3565,It's a song. so real opinion on it. what is a song you do like?
3565,I love Amen by Randy Travis and I love Islands in the Streams by Kenny Roger.
3565,good choices. I don't have strong favorites. I tend to just listen to whatever is on the radio.
3565,"Me too, but I tend to listen to top forty when I'm driving."
3565,"yes, music while driving is great."
3565,Do you listen to hip hop?
3565,"no, more pop and indie."
3566,I can imagine the TV ads are ridiculous!
3566,haha i know right i can't do political zealots
3566,"To be honest I'm hardly interested in politics, I'd rather just pursue my interests and live my life."
3566,same ! i totally think that independence is the way to go
3566,What are your interests? I love to play tennis and watch TV.
3566,"I like sport too. Watching and playing. All racket sports - tennis, badminton, squash"
3566,They are a good way to stay fit and have fun.
3566,Definitely. Great for meeting new people too. I play guitar in a band too. 
3566,"That is really cool, I'd love to do something like that but I don't play. How long have you done that?"
3566,my whole life really. I don't play as much as I used to though. Never too late to learn
3566,yep that's true. I am more interested in computers than music though.
3566,Do work with computers?
3567,"Well it's a long story, do you have time?"
3567,Of course. Give me the details.
3567,Dorcas had the idea to put a rotten banana in James' lunch when she made sandwiches that morning.
3567,That's not very nice. What happened?
3567,"Well I thought it was too, so I swapped them out. Well Dorcas saw me do it, and decided to throw all of our lunches out the window."
3567,That's terrible! Why would they do that?
3567,"She didn't want to get caught, I guess. James was a spiteful little kid."
3567,Did he try to get revenge?
3567,"No, but we had to tell Mom, and that didn't end well. So needless to say we were late."
3567,I can only imagine. Was mom mad?
3567,She was furious. I've never seen her look so stricken. Be turned the car around in perfect silence. We knew we were in for it.
3567,That makes sense. Did she ground everyone for a month?
3567,Worse. She made us eat banana sandwiches for a week.
3568,They taste sooooo good! I love them on sandwiches! 
3568,What else do you grow in your garden?
3568,"Some herbs, a few blueberry/strawberry bushes! Grapes... Exc... Some are the trees are taller than me! 6'1"
3568,Sounds like you have a lot of space. I'd love to grow more but I live in a small apartment in the city
3568,"Ah, Do you have a rooftop? Or maybe a small herb plant by a window!"
3568,I just have a balcony but it gets lots of sun so great for tomatoes and beans. I'll try strawberries next summer. 
3568,"You  know what they say, It tastes better when you grow it! Maybe a salad or?"
3568,Yes! I love a good grilled chicken salad or even a Greek salad.  That sounds good right now.
3568,I Might have to go make me a Sandwhich now! Hahahah!  Maybe a Salad to!
3568,Oh now you're just making me hungry!
3568,I am making myself hungry too! Midnight rampage to the fridge! Biggest walk of shame! 
3568,"Same! Hungry like the Wolf! Sorry it was a song that I was listening to yesterday, although relevant here!"
3568,"Hahhahaha, Well the fridge is calling!"
3569,"Yeah, it would make me feel a lot like the Beastie Boys, who I obviously idolize. Have you ever thought of moving to NYC?"
3569,I'd love to. I'd have to change schools though. Does being a museum curator require special schooling?
3569,"Yeah, but there are a few universities in New York, and I'm sure one of them offers a program that would make eligible. Expensive place though!"
3569,I grew up in a small town. Very conservative. NYC would be like a different world. 
3569,"It's just another big city to me, honestly, but twice the price. It's also the type of place where you go into a coffee shop and everyone's getting something crazy."
3569,Overpriced coffee with Italian sounding names to make them sound special?
3569,"More like hold the X, Y and Z, extra this and that. I'm a coffee with cream type of guy, that's it. Everyone's high maintenance over there."
3569,Sounds... complicated. I'd have to save forever to even visit. 
3569,"Well, if I ever end up there for school, you could stay with me for free. Just a flight to worry about, I guess. Worth visiting at least once!"
3569,That sounds enticing. You could show me the museums!
3569,"As a student, I think I'd get reduced admission as well. "
3569,The perks are limitless with you!
3570,Do you like exploring?
3570,Yes! I love looking for places to shoot ads for accounts I manage. I bring my golden retriever with me but the location doesn't allow. Do you have pets?
3570,I do! I have a little dog. Are you a photographer?
3570,No but I manage them in my advertising work. We work with companies all over the world. I'm away often so that's why I bring my dog when possible.
3570,Have you tried any crazy cuisine? That sounds like an awesome career.
3570,Nothing really crazy like brains or organs. But I try to sample the local cuisine where I can. What do you do for a living?
3570,I just work in retail. I'd love to travel somewhere and try any and all the meat. What's your favorite place you've traveled?
3570,Most meat is similar. It's all about the spices. I think my favorite place was the shoot we recently did alongside the pyramids in Egypt.
3570,I've heard that those are actually pretty close to the city and not even far into the desert
3570,Right. They are closer than many people think. Which is good because I wouldn't want to get lost and get stranded in the desert.
3570,"Totally, although I don't think i'd mind that so much, given how much I love the desert"
3570,Ha ha. Hope you get a chance to visit it one day! It's really a great experience.
3571,YES. And I bet he's so strong
3571,He sure is. Bet he got that way by eating his veggies!
3571,"And working out, I'm sure. Do you work out?"
3571,"I do work out, but he is on another level entirely. You?"
3571,I lift a lot of weights
3571,That is impressive. Will you be the next Michael Jordan?
3571,Maybe if I played basketball!
3571,"Haha, I feel ya. In my city there's not a lot of basketball courts so the kids set up hoops on the sidewalks."
3571,We had one in our driveway growing up
3571,Nice. Must have been fun huh.
3571,"yeah, definitely!"
3571,Do you ever go to the farmer's market?
3572,playing a game
3572,That's great. I've never won anything! I should play more games. 
3572,definitely.  
3572,What types of games do you play? Console or sports?
3572,Sports. Mostly fetch with my pets
3572,Cool. Love dogs. I have 3. How many do you have?
3572,Just one
3572,Nice. What will you do with the $200
3572,Buy my wife something.
3572,That's a nice thought. She'll be thankful for that I'm sure. 
3572,She deserves it.
3572,That's great. I'd probably treat someone if I won money too. Random Act of Kindness.
3573,"I was trying to get my kids back inside and when I was calling them, i stepped in dog poop. "
3573,Oh gross! You shouldn't walk outside barefoot anyway. You can get hookworms from the grass. 
3573,"Luckily, I knew how to clean myself to avoid infection."
3573,People are so irresponsible about cleaning up after their dogs. I just can't understand.
3573,"Yeah, cleaning after my two kids are tough, but I think cleaning up after a dog is easier. "
3573,I think so too. I also have two kids. Do you make time for any hobbies?
3573,"No. Unfortunately, I am a doctor and I don't have time for any hobbies, but sometimes I do have times to take vacations with my family."
3573,That sounds nice. We're going camping in the Florida Keys next month. Do you have any cool trips planned?
3573,"Camping with my two kids is difficult, so we have planned trips to go to the gulfarium. "
3573,Haha I think camping with my kids will be difficult too. They're 3 and 1. It will be fun though.
3573,Oh geez! Good luck wrangling a 3 and 1 year old!. That sounds very difficult!
3573,What kind of doctor are you? I'm taking online nursing classes.
3574,"Oh, that's cool! I do mostly oil painting. Abstract stuff"
3574,"That's so awesome. I'm still trying to refine my skills, trying to learn how to do electronic art."
3574,"Nice, with algorithms and arduinos and such? A few of my buddies showed me something similar while I was in Europe. Such great potential"
3574,"Well recently, I bought a drawing pad for my laptop. I really like reading about history and so I try and recreate the scenarios that I read about."
3574,"Oh I see, digital stuff. My bad. I've seen some really great digital work. Makes me jealous, heh. Reminds me of oil, but with undo."
3574,"Thank god it's so much more forgiving on computer haha. If I was to do oil, the canvas would be just a mess. Do you go to college?"
3574,"Yeahhh, it can really get messy fast, heh. Taking some time off college to travel, how about you?"
3574,"Oh that's super cool, where do you plan on going? I'm currently doing philosophy and history in college."
3574,"Ahh, hence the subject for art I guess, eh? I've just recently gotten back from Europe and Mexico. Was majoring in fine arts. Do you enjoy your studies?"
3574,"Yeah its good for inspiration, I'm not so creative otherwise. If only you had stayed in Mexico for a few more days, the formula 1 grand prix is this weekend."
3574,"Oh yeah? I occasionally check out F1, but I know almost nothing about racing. Seems really cool. Sure was some good spicy food down there, heh."
3574,"Haha, I know absolutely nothing either, I just watched the netflix documentary on the 2018 season and so I was hooked. Planning on heading anywhere else? Australia by chance?"
3575,"Oh wow, I didn't know lifts cost money. I'm Omar, by the way"
3575,"Yeah, there's a lot about skiing that I think people don't consider! I'm Daniel"
3575,Nice to meet you. Do you ever go skiing with your family?
3575,I did growing up
3575,"I have two older brothers, so it was kind of expensive to take us all on vacation growing up"
3575,That makes sense. I'm an only child so I think that helped with affording my expensive hobby
3575,what else do you like to do?
3575,"I like to take vacations, especially to florida. you?"
3575,I like to travel internationally. Florida is nice though
3575,Oh? Where have you been?
3575,"Paris, Rome, London. HAve you ever wanted to visit those places?"
3575,I backpacked across Europe after I graduated college
3576,A party? What kind of party?
3576,A small party with my family. You are also invited :)
3576,"Ayyy, sounds good to me. Seems like a good opportunity to meet someone new. You see, I'm kinda searching for a sweetheart."
3576,I wish you luck.  You have to meet the right one some day!
3576,Yep. And that right one has to like fishing just as much as I do.
3576,"I'd like to go fishing more but none of my friends are interested. I'm also interested in storytelling, music, drama, and dance for entertainment."
3576,Multi-talented I see. I'll bring my fishing gear to the party. We can go out afterwards if you want. Early morning is the best time after all.
3576,"Sure, That's sounds like a real plan. lol"
3576,So have you written any songs?
3576,"No, I have no music skills either."
3576,"What, no way. No need to be humble now."
3576,I meant when it comes to writing music lol.
3577,"Yeah, I feel like celebrating, but I'm also exhausted from the exam and my shift at McDonald's afterwards. I definitely just need to stay in tonight. Up to anything tonight?"
3577,I've got to take care of the cats. They can be high maintenance. I've a lot to get done in the next few weeks before vacation.
3577,"Ha, how many cats do you have again? I'm a dog person, can't imagine having any felines. What else besides taking care of them? They're occupying you all night?"
3577,I show them professionally. The care they require can be overwhelming sometimes. Dog's are fun too. Do you have any?
3577," Interesting! That's kinda cute, I guess. So a lot of grooming this evening then? I don't have a dog, too much going on in my life."
3577,Yes! The grooming is endless. But it's rewarding. How long have you been working at McDonald's?
3577,"Send me a photo of them sometime. I guess cats can be cute at times. Too long at McDonald's, nearly a year. "
3577,I'll have to do that. They really are beautiful. I'm ready to have a break from them though. I have a cruise to look forward to.
3577,Sorry they're so much work. I'm going to spend the evening playing video games and relaxing. Where is your cruise going?
3577,It's an Alaskan cruise. I can't wait! What's your favorite video game? 
3577,"That's amazing! Always wanted to go on something like that. I'm really into Mortal Kombat right now, heard of it?"
3577,That's old school! I'm an OG master of MK!
3577,"Whoa, I had no idea! Who's your favourite character?"
3578,"No, I am an only child, what about you?"
3578,I have 4 brothers and sisters.
3578,"Wow, big family. Was that awesome or what?"
3578,"sometimes. I am the youngest, so it wasn't always easy."
3578,Oh yeah that could be a negative or positive at different times. Have you guys ever done any sports or extreme sports as a family group?
3578,We weren't very into sports. We were more academic. We all went to the same college.
3578,"That's nice hey, it's good to have some familiarity involved in new places. The first time I went bungie jumping I went with my parents and it made it easy."
3578,"Oh wow, that sounds scary."
3578,"It was, but less than anticipated. There's still one thing left on my bucket list though; I need to get up in the air and skydive. "
3578,"Oh, that's even scarier. I had friends in college who went bungee jumping, but i don't even know anyone who's been skydiving."
3578,"It's a very daunting experience, but it's the closest thing to natural human flight. I can't even imagine the rush."
3578,I don't think I could ever do that. I have a brother who is a little more into things like that.
3579,You know a lot about this history. 
3579,Haha thanks. History is a passion of mine. Especially English history.
3579,That's awesome! I have a passion for working with my hands. 
3579,Super cool. What kind of stuff do you make?
3579,"I build a lot of things, especially garden things. I built a pergola a few weeks ago."
3579,Gardens are really cool. I bet it is relaxing to work on them.  I hope to have one some day.
3579,It definitely is. Where do you live? Is there not space for a garden?
3579,I currently live in a tiny New York apartment. Not much room sadly. But I want to move to London some day.
3579,That would be amazing!
3579,I know right. One of my three brothers already lives there and says its amazing. Where do you live?
3579,"I live in Portland, OR"
3579,Oh nice. Keep Portland weird!
3580,"Well I can appreciate the history of cheese, but I hate that stuff."
3580,There are many styles and flavors of cheese. Do you hate them all? ColbyJack is my favorite!
3580,Yes I hate all cheeses! I have hated them since I was little unfortunately. 
3580,I live in Wisconsin so hating cheese is almost like a sin! 
3580,Luckily I live in a secluded area near a paper mill so I can do my job. Cheese isn't a big deal over here.
3580,That is good! So is your job hard?
3580,Oh no! I sell paper products for a living so it isn't a hard job at all. What is your occupation? 
3580,I work in a flower shop. I am surrounded by beauty all day long!
3580,That's awesome! That sounds like an all around easy job to me. 
3580,"It is, except for weddings. Those can be a bit nuts with all the flowers and the mother of the bride!"
3580,Oh I can already see the chaos that could be! I would want to call out on that day!
3580,Definitely! I understand why people decide to elope! BUt it is good for business!
3581,"Lovely weather, upper 70 degrees Fahrenheit."
3581,"Oh man, totally down with this heat. It's a little hotter over here, but I don't mind it, and it's cool at night. I'll be out this evening in it."
3581,Do you enjoy the cooler night time weather?
3581,"Sometimes, I suppose it depends on my mood and where I'm going. Also makes for a nicer evening indoors, as I'm without AC."
3581,No AC? I hope you have windows and fans.
3581,"Of course I have windows, haha! A couple of fans too. Don't want my room and electronics to overheat or power to go out either. Blackouts!"
3581,"Good, I'm glad you have both lol."
3581,"Yeah, I'm watching the last few episodes of Game of Thrones tonight, and I really can't wait to see how it ends and why everyone hated it."
3581,I can't get into that TV series.
3581,"Ah, why not? Too many episodes? The violence? It's a hit."
3581,I don't know what it is.
3581,"Hmm, well I'd encourage you to give it a bit more of a try. Most of my friends came around!"
3582,"Ooh, what languages are you learning?"
3582,I'm picking up pieces of Spanish and French. I'd love to learn something difficult as well. Maybe Russian?
3582,"Very cool. I'm trying to convince my kids to learn Spanish, but of course they don't wanna listen to their momma!"
3582,True! They really should while they are young. At early ages they are like a sponge with language.
3582,Do you have young'uns?
3582,"No, I stay too busy traveling. I'm never home. How many kids do you have?"
3582,Just the two. Still leaves plenty of time for my hobbies. Where have you traveled recently?
3582,I spent a week in New York. A few days in Toronto. I'll be in England for a while.
3582,How lovely. Do you miss being home at all?
3582,"Sometimes, I own a beautiful house I never see. But I get to enjoy other cultures and see lots of interesting places. "
3582,Sounds too adventurous for me. I love to settle down with a good book or spend time cooking. 
3582,That's great! What do you like to read? Maybe you can recommend something? I love a good book while I'm traveling.
3583,"not so much, I wait tables at another pizza place nearby."
3583,DO you enjoy it? It sounds nice
3583,"I just do it on the weekends, but I'm hoping the new place doesn't affect business where I am."
3584,"Yeah, I like to run. How about you?"
3584,I like playing soccer
3584,That's cool!
3584,Am the goal keeper in my team
3584,That's awesome. not a lot of people can be a goal keeper
3584,"This is my talent ,i have passion in it"
3584,I think that's great!
3584,I like swimming too
3584,"dang, you're just all around athletic!"
3584,It keeps me buzy over the weekend
3584,I'm sure! I'm just busy planning my dang wedding
3584,when will be the wedding?
3585,"That's helpful advice, thanks. I should try that. I hope it's not too late. Has that ever happened to you?"
3585,"I dropped my phone in a full bathtub once, it still worked but I put it in rice to be safe"
3585,Very lucky! So what do you like to do for fun--bubble baths? haha
3585,"I have a pretty full household, nobody gets much more than a shower"
3585,Lots of kids?
3585,"I grew up with 4 siblings, plus parents"
3585,"Wow, a full household indeed. What do you do for work now?"
3585,I followed my dad's path and became a school teacher
3585,"Very nice. I'm a baker, working out of my home kitchen though"
3585,"My husband did a baking apprenticeship, he runs a kitchen now. What kind of baking do you do?"
3585,Custom cakes mostly. I tried to make it as an actor as a kid. Didn't work out. Baking was the only thing else I was good at. 
3585,"For me that was knitting, but you can't exactly pay the bills knitting. Acting is fun though, do you still do it?"
3586,A camaro. 
3586,Sweet! I love camaros!
3586,"Me too, I am a digital aritst, and was recently paid for a big job, so i decided to treat myself."
3586,Good for you! I write poetry for a living
3586,"I write a little, but I like to read more. Do you have a favorite author."
3586,"Yes, I'm a big fan of Steinbeck"
3586,Good choice. I like Stephen King.
3586,"Ooooh, you like spooky stuff then!"
3586,"Yes I do, do you?"
3586,Definitely! Especially around Halloween time!
3586,"Oh, I'm super excited for Halloween. I have been decorating and getting ready."
3586,I just spent all day making my costume for this year
3587,"I live in port tobacco village! Its a pretty small town, but I get by. "
3587,I'm originally from a small town. 
3587,What small town was it?
3587,cookeville
3587,That's ironic. I'm a short order cook at a local diner. 
3587,How long have you worked that job?
3587,Most of my life. I am no that old. I am just trying to save money to go somewhere else. 
3587,It's awesome that you have goals.
3587,What are your goals? 
3587,"Stop eating garbage, and exercise more."
3587,Those are always good goals to have in life and stay with them. 
3587,Yes it is.
3588,"Yeah I imagine they probably don't. Still, it's fun to imagine that there are beautiful creatures like that."
3588,It's weird how interested I actually find them to be. The way I describe them makes them sound like a reality. If only!
3588,I know right? I like reading fantasy novels personally. How about you?
3588,"Not too much of a reader, honestly. I'm all about fitness and staying active. I do like fantasy movies though!"
3588,Hey me too! I love working out. I just renewed my gym membership the other day.
3588,"Nice! Good to hear. I just run outside whenever I can. Trying to train for a marathon, just ran a half back in July."
3588,Oh? I have never ran in a marathon. I imagine I could use some work on my cardio first. Was the marathon for a good cause?
3588,"Well, you'd have to work your way up to it, it's not easy at all. But you could do it! Yeah, it's for a cancer foundation."
3588,Awesome. I love to hear when people do events and work for a good cause. We held a food drive not long ago.
3588,That's great. Did you raise a good amount of money? What charity did it go to?
3588,We helped a lot of people. It was for the needy in our home town. 
3588,Even more special. Results that you might be able to actually immediately see. That's sweet! Never thought of doing that.
3589,i love barbecued at the patty
3589,"on the barbecue ? yum , i absolutely love barbecued meats"
3589,"it very yummy ,i love meat alot"
3589,"i love grilling too , we grill steaks and chicken lots over the summer"
3589,i love griling expecally chiken
3589,Jerk chicken is the best according to  me of course. what say you?
3589,am with you chicken is the favorite 
3589,"so back to the grill , do you have one at home ?"
3589,yes i do have one at home
3589,Nothing beats cooking the good stuff during a little get together lol. 
3589,i cant wait for December for a family get together
3589,Same hopefully my family are prepared for some gut burners XD
3590,"I'm an only child, probably why I like to travel, when my parents went on vacation it's easy to take 1 kid with you"
3590,Yeah that makes sense
3590,Do you like to travel?
3590,"yes, traveling is fun. I like to visit my friend who lives in NYC"
3590,"NYC is great, especially the pocket communities, sometimes it feels like you're in a different country just a few blocks away"
3590,"yeah, that's definitely really neat"
3590,"I love trying the different kinds of food around, what's your favorite food?"
3590,All kinds of food! Probably my favorite is mexican though
3590,"Mexican is really good, I'd like to try some authentic Mexican food at some point"
3590,I learned to make authentic guacamole when I was in Cozumel!
3590,Nice! Any pointers?
3590,Lots of cilantro and onions
3591,"Yeah, I actually go there. Is creative writing a hobby or a career?"
3591,"Oh neat! I think of it as a hobby, but maybe something that could be a part-time career for extra income. I'm a plumber when I'm not writing."
3591,"Wow, sounds like you're a jack of all trades!"
3591,"Just anything to do with pipes, sewers, water systems, waste, etc. But maybe if I get my writing in order!"
3591,Have you ever considered teaching creative writing?
3591,"One step at a time, I guess if I got a bit more experience. I could start maybe by teaching youth. What about you, what do you study?"
3591,I'm getting a degree in elementary education. I want to teach English. So I'm a big fan of creative writing
3591,"Well then, you're certainly a little further along than I am. I could learn a thing or two from you!"
3591,I could say the same! I can't fix a leaky sink to save my life
3591,"They're gross, no one wants to, it's people like you that keep me employed!"
3591,"Haha, happy to be of service."
3591,"If you ever need someone to help with that kind of stuff, I guess I could give you a discount!"
3592,"Yeah, but it's like an argument, you always think of something witty later"
3592,i like jokes i rake jokes each time im around people
3592,Have you ever tried a local comedy competition? 
3592,i have never tried any
3592,It's a fun way to test your skill if you're feeling brave
3592,i think i have a talent i will join soon
3592,Sometimes the best part is just getting to see the other competitors 
3592,thats good i dear thank for the advice
3592,And if you're not feeling brave at least it's a night out
3592,"very true ,i will try it  out"
3592,Glad to hear it
3592,Nice
3593,My biggest dream is to have a brand in Paris that is as big as Yves Saint Laurent. 
3593,"Oh man, that would be amazing. Have you ever seen that show Project Runway?"
3593,Yes! I love seeing the designs they come up with and seeing the designers feedback.
3593,"Me too! I had never seen it before, I just started watching a couple days ago. I usually watch cooking shows."
3593,Have you seen the great British baking show? 
3593,I think I did see a little bit of that one. Do you like to cook?
3593,I am mostly into mixology like bartending. 
3593,Oh thats awesome! My friend went to mixology school? She said it was really fun. 
3593,My favorite drink to make is always going to be apple martinis! Do you have a favorite drink?
3593,I love bloody mary's. I don't really drink too much anymore. Apple martini sounds good though!
3593,Its my favorite thing to drink when i get a girls night out! 
3593,DO you work as a bartender or its just kind of a hobby?
3594,Nice What games? I myself love Mexican food!
3594,Action games. Mexican food is good.
3594,Cool. I'm more of a sports game fan. Do you have any kids? I have 2.
3594,No kids. Just fur babies.
3594,I have those too :) How about social media? Fan or no? I'm pretty much just Facebook.
3594,How old are your kids? Just Snap chat and Instagram.
3594,18 and 15
3594,Nice. 
3594,Best thing that's ever happened to me!
3594,I'm sure. I love my nieces and nephews.
3594,How old are they?
3594,"21, 16, 16, and 15"
3595,"So I'm fishing, right, having a beer or two with a pal, and a HUGE fish pulled me into the water when I wasn't ready for it!"
3595,"Big fish kind of creep me out, those huge pointy teeth on them"
3595,"Well I fell in, got completely soaked. My friend, I'm signalling to him to help pull me in, but he kept laughing!"
3595,"Oh no, did you have to swim to shore?"
3595,"Well, I'm all angry, furious really, and it took every ounce of the good in me not to pull him in with me. He eventually helped me out."
3595,Did you lose your reel?
3595,"Thankfully no, it stayed half in the boat when I fell in. Fish got away though."
3595,"There are other fish in the sea, or lake"
3595,"Ha, that's a good one. Anyhow, my friend and I eventually settled down, he felt bad for laughing."
3595,"Yeah, sometimes laughter is just a nervous reaction"
3595,"We go way back, I'll just laugh at his misfortunes next time!"
3595,That's what friends are for. At least you're safe
3596,"Ah, my mother looks after my grandmother now... We just chill and watch hockey together"
3596,how old is your grandma?
3596,Shes turning 69 this year!
3596,i guess she is still strong my grandma is 80
3596,well sadly shes in poor health.... but hopefully she will get better
3596,oooh sorry she will be fine
3596,I know! Shes a strong woman! Shes also a advid hockey fan like me! 
3596,very interesting 
3596,How old is your Father? The Preacher?
3596,my father is 49
3596,Ah! Here comes those harsh 50's!
3596,he is soon turning 50
3597,Money moves... work mostly
3597,There's nothing wrong with that. I've moved before due to a better job. What job did you get?
3597,Why would there be anything wrong with that? Do you think that you are better than me?
3597,Not at all. Some people may feel that is a hallow reason to move. I don't personally.
3597,"Listen, I could talk all day about myself but something tells me that wouldn't end well for you.  Tell me about yourself."
3597,Fine fine. I love to play music in my spare time. I've been playing the violin since I was ten.
3597,What a strange and oddly specific skill! Do you work for a living?
3597,Yes I do. I work for a non-profit organization. We help people find jobs actually. What about you?
3597,"I do voices for radio, because my face is too gorgeous for the big screen. Have you ever had a near death experience?"
3597,I had an accident at work when I used to work construction. I was out for 6 weeks. 
3597,"Have you ever dreamed of being a part of something bigger than yourself, or california?"
3598,I love to watch people fly fish.
3598,Me too. My uncle makes ornamental lures for flyfishing and mounts them in shadow boxes. THey're beautiful.
3598,Oh that sounds lovely. I would love to see one.
3598,They're very nice. Do you fish? Or do you have any other hobbies?
3598,I don't fish. I like to listen to music and ride my bike.
3598,Oh cool! Like mountainbiking or street biking?
3598,mountainbiking
3598,That sounds like fun. I mostly bake and do yoga. I keep planted and reef aquariums.
3598,Awesome. What is your favorite thing to bake?
3598,I just started baking with sourdough and I've been making a lot of pizzas. I think those are my favorite. And soft pretzels.
3598,"Oh goodness, I love soft pretzels. Sourdough is the best."
3598,"Yeah, I really love the sourdough. Its almost like having a pet because you have to feed it every couple of days and take care of it haha."
3599,Why is that?
3599,Sometimes dogs can be unpredictable 
3599,"No kidding, they do eventually copy their masters. "
3599,I think all dogs are good at heart
3599,Depends in my opinion.
3599,"They're like people, I think most people want to be good"
3599,Yeah i get you to some degree.
3599,I think the co-evolution of dogs and people is pretty neat
3599,I wonder if dogs would say the same thing. if they could walk in our shoes 
3599,"I think so, studies show dogs choose the company of humans over food"
3599,Wow! interesting lol.
3599,"I caught my dog and cat snuggling today, I knew they secretly liked each other"
3600,I was. I will do that for someone when I have extra money.
3600,That's really nice. The world needs more people like you.
3600,Thank you. I like nice people.
3600,"I like people with a sense of humor, they tend to be nice!"
3600,Usually lol. Do you eat meat?
3600,"very rarely . somehow , i'm not into meat that much. i'm actually trying to become a vegan."
3600,Really? I haven't eaten meat in years.
3600,Was it hard to stop eating meat?
3600,"Yes, but I watched a lot of movies on Netflix about it."
3600,Like which movies?
3600,I can't remember the names
3600,Cool. I hate seeing movies about animals suffering.
3601,I usually uses medicinal oil for my hair
3601,I hear that stuff is bad for you.
3601,But that same stuff seems to be good for me.
3601,Your hair must grow really quick!
3601,"Yes! Of course, it will be."
3601,"You have to be careful, it might be bad if you use it too much."
3601,"I agree with you, but I think this growth of hair would be my genetic evolution."
3601,Maybe. I think some people are just born with it.
3601,And so I'm lucky as that person.
3601,You certainly are!
3601,"I like Lizards, what about you?"
3601,I love lizards. I have a lizard named Jinx. 
3602,How old is fifi? I worry about my dog getting old
3602,5 yrs old she is getting older and older it makes me upset sometimes i get in fights over it
3602,"Yeah, I know the feeling. Did you get pet insurance at all? I'm still thinking if it's worth the cost"
3602,i have not got it i do not think i could afford it
3602,"Yeah. I love my dog, but I feel bad that I can't always give her all she needs.  Especially if a vet visit is involved"
3602,they charge alot for a lot of things you can do at home
3602,How do you find out what you can do at home? 
3602,my father raised alot of dogs and he learned how to give them their wormer and puppy and raby shots at home
3602,Oh that's really cool. And you can but the shots even thought you're not a vet?
3602,yes they usually sell them at a local co-op
3602,"I will definitely check it out! It's bad that they don't tell you these things, that can really help with keeping dogs healthy"
3602,yes but then they would lose out on money 
3603,"Well I'm now a part of that journey and challenge. First brewing my own coffee, now beer, although the latter is much more of a challenge."
3603,"You're funny, I like that! Please, tell me a joke."
3603,Well it's hard to think of a funny one just off the top of my head. Knock knock!
3603,"I guess you're not as witty as I thought, then.  Tell me something that you are good at!"
3603,"Well, I just started a joke, but if you don't want to hear it, saves me from disappointing you. I'm good at making a good cup of joe!"
3603,"Don't worry, I'm used to people disappointing me.  Actually, you remind me a lot of my dad."
3603,"Why's that? Is your dad funny, charming, handy, resourceful and a good coffee maker?"
3603," No, my father is a mess. Whats up with you and coffee? Drink a little too much?"
3603,"Well darn, that doesn't say the best things about me then. Maybe I did earlier on, had a few cups!"
3603,I feel like we got off on the wrong foot.  How old are you even?
3603,Too old to be chatting this late with so much coffee in my system.
3603,"In that case, I'm too old to be chatting with you! But here we are, so what do you do for a living?"
3604,1989 seems like just yesterday.
3604,Right? Makes me feel old.
3604,Makes me feel old too. How old are you?
3604,"39 next month, and you?"
3604,45 in December.
3604,"oh awesome, so you probably went and saw it in theatres also"
3604,Yes I did. It was awesome.
3604,Which other disney musicals have you seen?
3604,"Lion King, and you?"
3604,Yes I saw that.  Have you watched the new ones?
3604,Not yet. I've been wanting to. Have you?
3604," I started to watch the Lion King, but fell asleep because I was so exhausted. I did see the new Aladdin in theatres"
3605,I've never tried it.  It sounds gross.
3605,lutefisk is the best dish ever i love it. Try the marduk brand
3605,"I think I'll pass.  That's popular up North, isn't it?"
3605,"Yeah it's quite popular, especially here in Sweden where I just moved."
3605,That's pretty neat.  I've never been to Europe.  How is the weather there?
3605,It depends on the season I guess. What's your favorite time of the year?
3605,I like the Spring because the Summer is too hot.  Does everyone in Sweden really have blonde hair?
3605,Haha that's just a stereotype
3605,I was afraid I might stick out if I visited with my brown hair.  
3605,"Nah, many people have brown hair here. Plus we have people from all over the world, so you're more than welcome. Where are you from?"
3605,I'm from Texas in the USA.
3605,"Oh nice! Have you ever been to Texas' capital, Austin?"
3606,"i do not live to far from bentonville, arkansas"
3606,"Well, I guess you could go visit their headquarters if you were really passionate about them... if that's a thing."
3606,i am not to terribly passionate about walmart i do get my hair cut there but i keep it really short so they cant mess it up to bad
3606,"I didn't even know they gave haircuts, and I work there! Weird. Is that at many locations? Not mine."
3606,they usually have supercuts in walmarts or at least they do around here they also sometimes have mcdonalds or other fast food restraunts in the walmart as well
3606,"Oh, you mean nearby, not a Walmart brand haircut, that would be weird! Do you put product in your hair?"
3606,yes i like to use bed head products 
3606,"Oh, interesting, I've seen that stuff, but I've never purchased it myself. How do you style it? Back? Straight up?"
3606,i have a bob hair cut so kind of spiked up i usually straighten my bangs 
3606,"Cool, I just run my hair back and to the side with my product, which is some stuff my barber sells me, forget the name actually!"
3606,i like to keep it short because it is easy to maintain and it does not get in the way when im practicing piano
3606,"Same for me, I had it long when I was younger, too much work! I didn't know you played piano, how long have you done that?"
3607,i just lost my job so i have been sad about it
3607,"That's awful, I'm sorry to hear that. I lost my job once as well and times got really hard."
3607,i have been trying real hard to find another job 
3607,What area do you work in? I'm an athlete (strong and fast).
3607,i was in medical records 
3607,"Oh, that's nice, why did you lose your job?"
3607,the hospital i worked at had mass layoffs
3607,"oh , i am so sorry to hear about that . do you have any hobbies to uplift you ?"
3607,i like music but i get sad very easily and alot so i have to choose carefully which music i listen too
3607,Music can do that to you sometimes. When I notice I'm sad I like listening to rap music to pump myself up.
3607,i love rap music it does pump me up also my favorite artist biggie smalls
3607,i like some of his songs . what's your favorite song of his?
3608,Too bad that hasn't been working out so well in my relationships lately.
3608,"You'll find someone, dont worry. Where do you live again?"
3608,"A little off the beaten path, you wouldn't know it. I just can't bring myself to get out of my house."
3608,Where I live its winter right now and I CANNOT stand the cold!
3608,"Me either, tbh. But the hot stinks too- give me 75 degrees and sunny every day and I'll be happy!"
3608,I totally agree with what you're saying.
3608,"Yeah. I've been all around the world, but always end up back here, somehow."
3608,You can always fix that! Try staying in a foreign country for 1 month! See how you like it!
3608,"I've done that before- I lived in Australia for seven months! Too bad changing my location doesn't change myself, if you know what I mean."
3608,"Thats Insane, you have to show me pictures."
3608,"Sorry mate, I'm not really the picture taking type of gal. Is that something you like to do?"
3608,I love taking pictures!
3609,I seriously hope you're not defending the sustained and abhorrent abuse of pups!
3609,I am not defending the abuse of pups. I support my local SPCA
3609,"Do you have any pets of your own?  I am a two time adopter at my local shelter, too"
3609,I have 2 dogs. Both are rescued.
3609,You are very lucky.  What are they like?  I wish my landlord would allow dogs!
3609,They are both lab mix and are very active and love to play together. Your landlord wont allow dogs or any pets?
3609,"Nah, they're total hypocrites and have a dog but won't allow them.  But they let me have Luna, my 2yr black kitty!"
3609,That's a great name for a cat. Do you live in a rural area?
3609,No I like in a fairly large city.  Do you?  Wondering if your dogs have a yard to play in lol
3609,I live just outside a large city also. We have a very large yard for the dogs to play. Does your cat go outdoors at all or mostly stay inside?
3609,"That's great, happy to hear.  I live on a pretty busy street with a lot of strays, so she stays inside!"
3609,Thats's nice. Hope your cat doesn't try to chase any of the strays.
3610,It was just so embarrassing. But there were a couple of really cute young guys that helped me up. 
3610,I'm glad you did not get hurt
3610,"Bruised nothing but my ego. I'm such a romantic, I got home and daydreamed about those young guys being like white knights coming to my rescue."
3610,Well you got some wild imagination
3610,So I have been told. I like using the old stories the best.
3610,So did you finally get the license
3610,After all of that they bumped me up to the front of the line. I think they wanted me out of there before I fell again.
3610,Well it finally paid off I suppose
3610,I just had to put my best assets to use. 
3610,What do you mean by assets
3610,My ability to make something good come out of a bad situation.
3610,That's very optimist 
3611,"Oh, yeah I love coffee! I get mine straight from where I work; Amazon."
3611,Do you like it black? Cream or sugar?
3611,"I like it black, no sugar, no additives. That way I can really taste the actual coffee and it's quality."
3611,That's fair. Hot or iced?
3611,I like it hot :-). What about you? I think a lot of fellow conservatives like hot coffee.
3611,"Me too. My friends are always like, 'Todd, why won't you even TRY iced?' Because I'm happy with hot, Martha. That's why XD"
3611,"Haha, certainly, as they say, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"". What do you do for a living?"
3611,I'm an illustrator for a comic book start up- comics are my favorite things. You?
3611,I'm a sales representative for Amazon. Actually I also sell comic books from time to time.
3611,"Oh yeah, you said you worked for amazon earlier. What else do you sell?"
3611,"I also sell pots, pans, and Donald Trump merchandise when I get the chance."
3611,I'm getting strong Republican vibes... do you live in the South?
3612,"Yeah, it's nice because the store I work in gets so Halloween themed. Why do you eat mexican food then?"
3612,Mexican food is great! There are so many great options.
3612,"Yeah, I agree, I just suppose I haven't usually eaten it around Halloween is all. What's your favourite Mexican food to eat?"
3612,I really like enchiladas a lot.  There are a lot of fun Mexican celebrations around this time because of Dia de los Muertos.
3612,"Right!! Forgot about that Holiday. Must be a lot of fun. I think I prefer burritos to enchiladas, but they're both tasty!"
3612,Burritos are really good.  They're also easy to take to the animal clinic I work at.
3612,What filling do you like in your burritos? Which animals do you take care of? Way different than my job in a craft store.
3612,I like different burrito fillings on different days.  There are a lot of kinds of animals in the clinic but especially dogs and cats.
3612,"I tend to pick either chicken or steak in mine... sometimes fish, but rarely. Love dogs, it's nice that you care for them. Do you like dogs more?"
3612,"My favorite are the cats, but dogs are also fun.  Is the craft store usually busy?"
3612,"We're busy before certain events, and also when school starts. Sad you're not as much of a dog person as I am. I find cats to be mean."
3612,I really like dogs too!! Especially cute puppies.
3613,What are your other hobbies
3613,I really enjoy running through my local trails.  What about you?
3613,I like to watch some good movies.
3613,"What kind of movies do you typically watch, and how?"
3613,"My favorite genre is crime, comedy and horror."
3613,"I like dying my hair different colours, but we can't all be as interesting as me."
3613,Well you're right unless you dye them neon green.
3613,Have you ever dyed your hair?
3613,No I never felt the need to. Perhaps when I start getting grey hair.
3613,i love weird hair colors . maybe we can meet up and go to movies ?
3613,That sounds like a very good idea.
3613,"I will dm you an invite, but you gotta buy be dinner if I'm gonna be buying popcorn."
3614,how long have you been a yoga instructor?
3614,Since the 1980's when the yoga boom hit
3614,Did you have to do any training to become an instructor?
3614,"Oh yeah, I did a lot of yoga retreats and paid tuition for many years before finally getting my certification."
3614,How many times a week should I be doing yoga. I am very active and I cosider myself to be in pretty good shape
3614,"Yoga can be done every day, in fact it would be best to have a routine for the mornings or evenings."
3614,I have also heard that yoga is good for kids?
3614,"Yoga is very good for not just kids, but everyone of all ages, genders, shapes and sizes."
3614,Every day for kids also?
3614,"It really depends, there are many different kinds of yogas. Some are not appropriate for children, some are easy and can be done every day."
3614,I would like to have my boys increase their flexibility for sports.
3614,Yes yoga could be nice. It also helps to develop a bond with the children.
3615,"I guess I could, I just prefer to spend my time out on the waves instead of at a store."
3615,Ah. I really love online shopping. 
3615,"Yeah, it's pretty convenient. I just wish I could get something to help me with all the WEIRD dreams I have."
3615,Do you mean bad dreams or something else?
3615,"Nah, just weird ones that make me feel like I didn't actually sleep much the night before."
3615,That's actually not good. Not getting enough sleep does not affect you positively. 
3615,"I know. Last night I got 13 hours, so I wouldn't say I'm doing too bad. I do wish I had gotten up earlier so that I could surf, though."
3615,What do you mean surf though? 
3615,"Like, at the beach? Web surfing is cool too, I guess, but I love being outside?"
3615,"Yes I also love being outside, nature is awesome. "
3615,Agreed. It's pretty great.
3615,"I love spring especially, when all the new flowers come and the landscape just looks fresh.   "
3616,"blegh, rather have some chocolate milk tbh"
3616,I don't like milk. I love to be outside.
3616,"thats nice, but how is that relevant? do you hunt or something?"
3616,"No, I don't hunt. I love looking at the beautiful landscape. I was done talking about taco."
3616,"Me too, I hate them and so should you.  I like being outside very much, while drinking chocolate milk."
3616,Do you ever drink Hot Chocolate?
3616,"Yes, I like to substitute warm milk or hot water for warm chocolate milk. Wbu"
3616,I only drink hot chocolate in the winter. 
3616,Do you also drink water in the winter? or just hot chocolate lol
3616,ha ha ha. I drink water in the winter.
3616,"You're not gonna believe this, but I only drink chocolate milk.  Period."
3616,yuck. I don't drink milk
3616,Still tastes better than tacos!
3617,I love papa john's pizza. I think the flavor is very special!
3617,I'll have to try them sometime! I only ever eat out anyway.
3617,"Ah, what kind of pizza do you like?"
3617,Margharita is my fav. What about you?
3617,I like peperroni and sausage pizza but I feel guilty eating it afterwards lol.
3617,"Classic. I'm not a huge meat eater myself, esp not on pizza."
3617,"Ah, cool! I'm actually thinking of going vegan."
3617,Not sure if I could do that- I just love regular ice cream too much lol
3617,"Haha, true. They have vegan ice-cream these days. I heard it's pretty good."
3617,"Might be. Not sure if it's AS good though. So, what do you like to do for fun?"
3617,I personally like going for a run in the morning.
3617,"That's awesome! I'm a bit of a self-proclaimed E-girl, so I don't do many things like that."
3618,Oh interesting 
3618,"She was born in New York, which is why she made her clothing labels there too. I love her music. I listen to her in the shower."
3618,You sound like a fan of her designs.
3618,She's great. Fashion is in her blood. Her mother was a model and her father was a tailor.
3618,I wonder what kind of creativity a person like her most develop.
3618,"She's an artist, so I'm guessing artistic creativity."
3618,My little girl of Seven would probably geek out over this stuff lol. hopefully her dream of being designer happens one day
3618,"Haha, that's so wonderful! I hope she is very successful!"
3618,Maybe i should get her some designs from some professionals 
3618,"Do it! She will be so grateful, especially when she grows up!"
3618,"Lol thanks, why not "
3618,What kind of hobbies do you have?
3619,"Yes, I contacted them but they said they don't have any in the lost and found."
3619,"Maybe someone took it before they found it, ask them if they have security footage? "
3619,"Well, I think I'll try to get it tracked by Samsung. Technology is amazing these days."
3619,Yea. That is true. Someone used it to find his missing phone. 
3619,Oh yeah. What kind of phone do you use?
3619,"I also use an android called xiaomi. The ram is a bit low on the phone though, so I plan to buy a new phone.  "
3619,Oh I've never heard of that. It sounds exotic and cool. I have an ordinary samsung one. I really hope I can find it.
3619,"I also hope you really find it, taking something out of your budget that you didn't plan for is uncomfortable. "
3619,"No worries. Everything happens for a reason, that's what I believe."
3619,I also believe in the same thing. 
3619,What religion do you belong to?
3619,I'm a christian. 
3620,"Yeah, hopefully will have enough free time to continue painting though."
3620,Do you like painting?
3620,"Not at all, but I'm very good at it.  Been selling work to keep me off the streets.  Have you ever been homeless?"
3620,"No, never actually. Have you ever been homeless? How long?"
3620,"If you count living out of your car, about 4 months.  I paint in local parks to have a visual reference for organic life."
3620,"well, you never know what could be in the future. Maybe in one day it happen with me. So far I'm enjoying life and listening techno music"
3620,"Sounds like you're living the dream, buddy!  Do you listen to techno music for a living?  Lucky you."
3620,"No, I'm not so professional in music to make enough money. It's just hobby. I also like comics. How about you?"
3620,"I'm a painter that lives out of their car dude, please tell me more about yourself lol"
3620,"That's good. Well, I'm 35 from Austin, Texas and doing some low level work as researcher in a lab, but they don't pay very well. So music is my passion."
3620,Would you be open to letting me paint you?
3620,"Yes, why not. It sounds cool."
3621,Tried it once but got scared from the thoughts of drowning lol. 
3621,Fishing is fun because you can cook and eat the fish after.  Do you always stay away from water?
3621,"For the most part, but i do enjoy watching others fish from afar ."
3621,Are there any particular activities you like to do on vacation?
3621,Hunting and watching the stars by a nice campfire .
3621,What kinds of animals do you hunt?  I've never tried it.
3621,Mostly deer and ducks i sometimes try to hunt bears foolishly XD
3621,Sounds fun.  I think campfires are fun too.
3621,Shooting is a responsibility and requires a lot of patients like fishing  does.
3621,Did it take a long time to learn to shoot well?
3621,"Yep but its a fun experience, especially when your take the movies out of the picture.   "
3622,"I love to learn too, especially since it is an activity that can be performed in solitude."
3622,"I see that you love being alone, I also love my alone time. "
3622,So what kind of things do you like to learn about?
3622,"I like to learn about cooking, how the world works and unknown facts.  "
3622,That's pretty interesting. I like to learn about different forms of fashion and textile design. I sew in my spare time.
3622,That's cool. I've always wanted to learn how to sew but never got the right tools for it. :(
3622,"The initial outlay can be expensive, a good sewing machine will set you back about $400 aus. But it is well worth it. I'd highly recommend giving it a go."
3622,"What advice do you have for me learning though, just getting the machine without the needed guidance will be a waste."
3622,"There are plenty of YouTube tutorials out there. If that's not your thing, there are lots of books and community sewing classes out there. "
3622,"Youtube videos is actually more of my thing that reading books, since I'll be able to see what they are actually doing. "
3622,"Yeah YouTube is great like that. You really can learn anything off of there, it's a bit nuts actually. What's the weirdest thing you've learnt off YouTube?"
3622,How to cook a weird food. :)
3623,"Yes, I sell their wool to local spinners. They can be quite aggressive"
3623,oh that sounds complicated. do u enjoy wat you do?
3623,"I find it exposes me to a broader part of the community which I represent, and I think that is really important as a member of the city council."
3623,Oh wow you sound pretty depended on. how old are you/
3623,"46, how old are you?"
3623,38
3623,are you married?
3623,yes i am and i have 3 teenagers. how about you?
3623,No kids. Just a lot of Alpacas. 
3623,lol right. well thats nice. sounds pretty rewarding.
3623,"Yep, love me some alpacas. Do you have any pets?"
3623,yes just a basic household cat and dog.
3624,"That's so interesting, have you personally seen it? I think I would be great in a broadway production."
3624,No I haven't. But now I want to see.
3624,Seeing a musical on your own seems a bit lonely. Who will you take with you?
3624,It's just me. I like the solitude
3624,"So long as you are enjoying yourself, I suppose. Would you like to be in a musical?"
3624,That would be great. I can 
3624,Were you in theatre throughout school?
3624,"Ye, we put on theatrical performances for my local community"
3624,"Cool. You must have a lot of confidence then, that is admirable"
3624,I sure do! I can't wait to show off my strengths.
3624,What other things are you into?
3624,"Hunting, fishing and computers."
3625,I studied business as well. there is always a demand for that. so how old are you?
3625,I am 21.  i have just finished studying so I thought it might be a good time to take a break before entry into graduate school.
3625,right that sounds smart so you dont get burned out on it easy
3625,I was hoping to do some volunteer work or travel and do an internship. I am still researching it. Any ideas on where would be good to visit?
3625,well i didnt really travel far. im in texas and theres always good stuff going on here. wat kind of volunteer work?
3625,Texas is a great place! Maybe something with animals or kids. What would you recommend?
3625,animals. we need more volunteer and help with the ones that get stranded and abused. its so sad. i have tried.
3625,Really?   We actually have a lot of rescue places in my town.  They do not take kindly to people abusing animals in my neck of the woods.
3625,i really wish we had more. or maybe offers of helping to fix them or anything like that.
3625,"You should definitely look into it, it's people like you who make these things happen"
3625,i always wanted to start my own puppy farm here in the country. so what else interest you?
3625,"Puppy farms are a bad term in Australia, it's where someone overbreeds their dogs just to make money"
3626,yea i dont eat hamburgers. but i love ck alfredo. what about u?
3626,I eat meatloaf with my mother as oftn as I can.
3626,oh thats cool i like shrimp too. do u?
3626,Man I LOVE shrimp!
3626,me too. i dont care for it cold but saute is the best.
3626,"It is amazing, especially with alfredo sauce."
3626,yes i agree
3627,I can't either that's why I drink so much beer. lol
3627,What kind of beer do you enjoy drinking?
3628,I guess so. Obama never lived on a lake like I do
3628,holddddd up.. he is making america great again
3628,can you guess a pet peve of mine?
3628,lol . . really . . its interesting . . tell me something more . .
3628,it is that I hate school
3628,"school can be hard on anyone , especially socialiazing with other students"
3628,"yes, especially for me because I am a hairy boy"
3628,You are not alone 
3628,"thank you, hairy brother. What activities do you enjoy besides shaving in the moonlight?"
3628,all the time at the lake
3628,"yes I also spend much time at the lake since I live on one, while hating school"
3628,yes school is fun
3629,"That's so interesting, are you into hunting?"
3629,I don't but they make good dogs for hunting though.
3629,"I kind of like hunting, I'm into other sports, like football. What are you into?"
3629,I like fishing and metal detecting. Anything outdoors is enjoyable.
3629,Nice. Nothing better than fresh fish!
3629,Very true. I only fish catch and release though.
3629,"Why? Seems kind of . . . more cruel, in a way."
3629,I can't bring myself to cutting up fish. Ha ha.
3629,Hahaha. You should take a friend with you that can do it! What kind of fish are there in your area?
3629,"Good Idea. I catch bass and bluegills,I like freshwater fishing most."
3629,Sounds delicious. What's the weather like where you live?
3629,Hot Summers and Cold winters. I wish I lived in a tropical place though.
3630,yes I also enjoy that era. I majored in american literature.
3630,History is one my favorites as well!
3630,perhaps you've heard the expression rome wasn't built in a day?
3630,Yes and that was a sequence of 7 historical novels by French author Maurice Druon.
3630,"well my house won't be built in a day either, I just fired my contractor"
3630,"Aw, that's no fun. I bet the constant construction didn't help at all"
3630,he mocked my dream of being a gym teacher at an elementary school
3630,that must be hard on you
3630,"yes it was very taxing, he's also my brother"
3630,Lol brothers.. mine was the same when we were little
3630,"I am going to tell on him, when I turn 37 I'll be able to hire my own contractor"
3630,sounds like a good idea
3631,"I sleep with a baseball bat next to my bed, something my Dad always encouraged."
3631,That's a good idea.  You never know when someone might break in.
3631,"Yep. Last night was the first time though, has anyone ever broken in to your home"
3631,"No, but I think it's best to be prepared because there are all kinds of bad people."
3631,"Fair enough, what are your opinions on gun control?"
3631,It's good to restrict guns to keep psychopaths from getting them but it's also good to have a gun to scare them away.
3631,"Hahaha. But if there was stricter gun control, the psychopaths wouldn't have any guns, right?"
3631,Yeah hopefully.  Good to make sure all doors and windows are locked just in case.
3631,"Hahahaha, this is true. So do you prefer the day or the night? "
3631,I like night because it's quiet and a good time to read.
3631,Me too! though i love the feeling of sunshine on my skin too. What kind of books do you like?
3631,I like fantasy and historical fiction.  What about you?
3632,It doesn't help that if I don't have my glasses I often don't realise there's pineapple there until I've eaten it!
3632,"That does not sound good to me, either. I cannot stand pineapple!"
3632,"My workplace put some fruit platters out for the kids - they loved everything apart from the pineapple, that's got to tell you something, hasn't it?!"
3632,It sure does! hahah. What kind of work do you do?
3632,I work in a library - I really enjoy working with kids so I got moved to cover the children's section. It's really rewarding when we do our 'story-time' sessions.
3632,That sounds like a really neat job. You must be a very patient person!
3632,"Oh, you have no idea. They're lovely kids but there's always that one little terror! What about you? What do you do for a living?"
3632,"Hey! I used to be that terror! haha. I am a police officer, but I've recently gone back to university and am studying microbiology"
3632,Well that's quite a change in direction! What made you take that leap?
3632,"Always been keen on the sciences, fell into police work really! But i have had a good run :) "
3633,"Yeah, my parents don't like my girlfriend much either"
3633,Do they usually get along with other people?
3633,"Yes, but they can be picky. Are your parents like that too?"
3633,My parents will pretend to like someone they don't really like.  It's harder to figure out if they like someone.
3633,"I'm not sure what is worse, haha. My mother is a teacher so she feels the need to tell everyone what to do."
3633,That sounds difficult.  My parents will refuse to give advice if I decide not to do something.
3633,Oh. My parents are good but it just would be nice if they just let me live my life without their advise all the time
3633,I would actually like more advice from my parents.  I usually ask my sister for advice.  Do you have any siblings?
3633,"Yes, more than I can count haha. I guess it can be good and bad"
3633,I always thought it would be fun to have a lot of siblings.  I only have one.
3633,It's like a party is always happening but it can get a little stressful at times too. Lots of fun though
3633,It's like a classroom and your mom is the teacher haha
3633,Yeah haha
3634,"Yeah I like all kinds of food.  I really like berries, especially raspberries."
3634,There are some great pie recipes for all types of berries under my diet
3634,Do you bake a lot?  I don't bake very often.
3634,whenever i have a day off and im not sleeping!
3634,I usually have a lot of cooking to do and not a lot of time.
3634,why do you have so much cooking to do?
3634,Not much free time and 3 kids.
3634,how old are they? what are their favorite foods?
3634,"They are 6, 3, and 1 and they like to eat spaghetti and chicken nuggets"
3634,typical kids! do they like any vegetables?
3634,"Sometimes they do and sometimes they don't, it changes a lot."
3634,what about fruit?
3634,They like fruit more than veggies.
3635,I think I will get a dog
3635,you should get one . pets are awesome !
3635,Which breed of dog do you think I should get?
3635,I would recommend a Labrador Retriever or German Shepherd.
3635,"Nice, I was thinking the same thing"
3635,they are great dogs for people like me who are artists. what do you do?
3635,I am a school teacher
3635,"Oh that's fun, teachers are some of the most underpaid people in the world."
3635,"I know, but I love children and moulding their young minds."
3635,"Agreed.   Their  educational, clinical and therapeutic services are essential to modern life."
3635,So true
3635,"i could never be a teacher, an artist for life."
3636,"Yes, they deal with the majority of customers"
3636,I do not like my dead end 9 to 5 job. I am a salesman for snakeskin oil.
3636,Are you looking to switch jobs?
3636,"Yes, I am constantly looking for something better. What do you do for a living?"
3636,"I work at a bank. Well being a bank teller would be much less stressful than a salesman job, especially if its commision based."
3636,"Maybe, I should look in to a teller job. I don't know. Just keeping my options open."
3636,Have you looked at any other jobs?
3636,"I have, actually. I have always wanted to work in a department type store."
3636,If youre interested in a bank job I can speak to my manager and see if he can fit you in for an interview. Interested?
3636,Not at the moment. I'm actually thinking about going to work for Costco. It's my favorite place to shop so maybe I could get a discount.
3636,"Last time I was at Costco I saw that they were hiring, I hope you find what youre looking for!"
3636,Thank you me too!
3637,what a bad experience like i dont even want to keep taking about it
3637,Was there any disciplinary action taken against you?
3637,Not really i noticed my Boss what just mad at me earlier before the meeting
3637,"Reminds me of a teacher I had in one of my three science classes. One lesson, he was demonstrating hydrogen and he set his hair on fire!"
3637,"Omg, that is so bad. What was he thinking?"
3637,I don't think he was paying any attention! So what is it you do for a living?
3637,for now i just write and publish my Books
3637,What's the topic of your books?
3637,i write poets and i also take time for skating. i love it
3637,Sounds like you have some real talent there.  Keep up the good work.  I bet you'll be famous one day!
3637,Yea i love to live my dream life you know. what in for your weekend?
3637,"Not much. I'm currently living at home but I'm sorting out a move to the dorms for next year, so planning for that really."
3638,"Yes, it does. It's having that pride each morning of being able to walk out the door knowing I'm supporting us. What about you, are you working just now?"
3638,I'm a stay at home mom and honestly it's the hardest job i've ever had but the most rewarding one.
3638,"Oh, wow! That's one of the most important, crucial jobs anyone can do in this world!"
3638,it sure is I have 2 children. My husband is the sole provider for us he goes out to work.
3638,"That's impressive. I try and exercise every day, but I'm guessing you'll get plenty of exercise with two! How old are they?"
3638,They are 10 and 4. Yes they are but I try to work out twice a week as well.
3638,"What do you like to do? For me, it's swimming - no impact and good for all the muscle groups."
3638,"Swimming is really fun, I like swimming as well I like to cycle as well."
3638,"Cycling is good but as I wasn't working, I couldn't afford a bike! Hopefully that'll change!"
3638,"Maybe you could cycle to work.  It is an efficient mode of transportation, so you can workout while also being productive,"
3638,I hadn't even thought of that. I'd save so much money on travel too. Thank you for that suggestion! 
3638,excellent idea ! that and along with a healthy diet and lifestyle will surely pay off .
3639,She is
3639,"nice to meet you abby , name mike ."
3639,"I'm not Abby Mike, Abby is my friend"
3639,Ok now this is just getting weird. Can we talk about something else.
3639,"Yes no problem at all, what would you like to talk about? I take martial arts after school, we could talk about that?"
3639,I have always been fascinated by the martial arts particularly the portrayal of karate in movies.
3639,"Karate isn't really as useable as the films make out sadly, it mostly looks good for coordinated moves"
3639,"Yes, especially when you consider American Karate as a generic term. when was your last training"
3639,"I last went 2 days ago, have you ever done martial arts training?"
3639,"honestly, not really. i prefer HIT training and classes like bodypump and Barre. I hope a made a good choice"
3639,"Theyre certainly both effective training methods, especially HIT training"
3639,But the philosophy emphasizes defensive and offensice moves all at the same time.  That sounds difficult to me. How about you?
3639,"It's pretty difficult, no doubt about it"
3640,What are your skills?
3640,"I speak French and German, as well as English. I am an English major, and worked in a restaurant in college"
3640,Sounds like you'd do very well in an upscale restaurant. 
3640,I think I can do that. But I would like something where I can really build a career and develop myself
3640,Do you have anything specific in mind? 
3640,Maybe journalism. I think my language and writing skills would help. But it's such a competitive industry
3640,Have you considered ghost writing or contributing to blogs to get your foot in the door? 
3640,That's a great idea. I've been working on my own travel blog. Maybe I should start approaching other sites and offer to write for them
3640,I think that would be an awesome idea. Having your name visible elsewhere would give you a leg up.
3640,Thanks so much for the suggestion! Do you write at all?
3640,Only in my head. 
3640,Haha. What do you do for a living? Something interesting?
3640,I'm an aviary caretaker. I care for a few hundred birds from tiny canaries to fairly large parrots.
3641,you know i cant leave them behind!
3641,"Well, I get that, but I'm not sure the cinema will let you bring them in? I love going to the movies but haven't seen cats there before!"
3641,Can we just leave them in the kennel back home? I wouldnt bring them in lol!
3641,"That'd probably be more appropriate! If we're going to eat out with my family after, we could go to that cat friendly place?"
3641,"That would be amazing, Im sure my babies will love it. Your family wont mind?"
3641,"No, they've got cats too, well, just the one, so they'll be quite comfortable. What time do you want to meet?"
3641,"Im totally free, what time would be good for you?"
3641,Let's go for 4pm - that'll give us time for the movie and tie in nicely with the meal. Meet you at the store?
3641,"Yes, we can meet there, but remember we have to drop off the babies first!"
3641,"Aaah, totally forgot. Okay, well we can just take my car then and leave yours at the store? Make sure they've got their carry cots!"
3641,"Of course, they dont leave the house without them. Is there enough space in your car?"
3641,There will be once I clear some space out! You can clean up any stray hairs afterwards!
3642,"I'm sure he does, sadly his knowledge of my effort isn't going to pay for me to adopt more animals"
3642,I hope you get a promotion soon. What type of animals do you adopt?
3642,"I have three dogs at the moment, but I sponson a few animials in rescue centres through charitable donations"
3642,"That's very nice of you. I like to care for pets too, my favorite are fish"
3642,Do you have many fish?
3642,"I have a bunch of goldfish, I have had them for several years"
3642,My family had goldfish when I was younger. Mine was the biggest and called Caspa. He occasionally ate some of the smaller fish though
3642,"Haha, oh no! That must have a been a very big gold fish. "
3642,"Yeah he ended up pretty big in the end haha. I like goldfish as an adult though, they're pretty therapeutic to watch"
3642,"They are. I like to just watch them swim around some times,they can be funny little creatures"
3642,"I totally agree, fairly easy to care for as well, and a great pet to have for children"
3642,Another nice thing about them is that they live really long compared to other fish.
3643,What's it called?
3643,So High by Jay Sean
3643,"Thanks, I'll give it a listen. What do you enjoy doing in your free time?"
3643,"Well lately Ive been thinking of proposal ideas, have any good ones?"
3643,Marriage or Business proposals? 
3643,marriage! Im proposing soon
3643,Is she passionate about anything in particular? 
3643,"Shes planning the biggest baby shower ever, she is going to invite everyone in our contacts!"
3643,Perhaps you could work it into the baby shower. Youd need to have her friends in on it to help pull it off.
3643,"wow i hadnt thought of that! if it were you, how would you do it?"
3643,Maybe a baby shower game. Its her turn. Shes blindfolded. She uncovers her eyes and you're on one knee?
3643,Ill have to see what games she has planned. Ill talk to her friends. Are you married?
3644,Well Im upset because he didnt ask for help. How would I help him if I dont know he needs help?
3644,You're right. You wouldn't have known before he asked to cheat. It's sad to feel used that way.
3644,Has anything like that ever happened to you?
3644,Yes. I've been used and it's always hard for me to say no. But eventually I had to start saying no. 
3644,"You know, thats one of the hardest things for me to do, is say not to people. So I feel you."
3644,"I heard a saying once that helped me get better at saying no. ""What you allow is what will continue"". If you say no, they wont continue using you"
3644,Thats good advice. Thanks for sharing it with me. I will be more assertive.
3644,It might take some time and practice but you'll get better at it. 
3644,"ITs difficult when family starts being that way, but I have to learn. "
3644,Family is harder for sure. They are more belligerent. But its okay to stand up for yourself and respect yourself. They should too.
3644,"By the way, how is your family doing?"
3644,"I haven't spoken to them in a long time, but I think they must be ok or they'd have called."
3645,"Nothing really, haha! "
3645,"To be fair i was the same leading up to our wedding - my wife did most of the work, all I did was turn up!"
3645,"Haha! Weddings can be stressful, I just hope I don't forget anything "
3645,"Make sure you make the most of your bridesmaids/grooms party, they can take a lot of stress off you"
3645,That's a good idea. I will use them if I need help. How long have you been married?
3645,Coming up to 2 years in November
3645,"Cool. I can't wait to eat some wedding cake, it's the best"
3645,"Ours was slightly disappointing to be honest. I think where its made in stages parts of it had dried out slightly, I hope you don't have the same experience"
3645,Oh no. I think I should make sure the baker is knowing what he is doing so this doesn't happen to mine.
3645,"We did let them know afterwards to be fair, they were fairly apologetic. It definitely looked the part though to be fair"
3645,"I guess it can be hit or miss sometimes. There are other things I should be concerned about, like the food I guess"
3645,"We had a huge buffet, and there was loads of food left over"
3646,"Oh, I didn't know it began as a bookstore. Interesting."
3646,Yeah they diversified after that took off. Where do you work?
3646,I'm a personal assistant for a celebrity.
3646,Sounds like an amazing job haha!
3646,It's a really weird job. What about you?
3646,"It's not bad, the pay isn't too good, but it's okay for now. "
3646,Oh do you work for Amazon?
3646,Yeah I do
3646,Do you guys ever read the gift notes people add to orders?
3646,"Every now and then, don't think we're supposed to "
3646,Are you as overworked as the media says?
3646,"Yeah absolutely. The conditions are pretty terrible, especially if you're old."
3647,Do you like to collect stamps? It's one of my hobbies.
3647,"""Yes I am also collect"""
3647,"Cool. I am just starting out collecting stamps, I want to get some really old ones"
3648,"I can make fart noises with my armpits, thats about as close as I come to music"
3648,"Haha. I think it is somthing you have to be born with , kind of like being an artist"
3648,I couldn't agree with you more! Do you perform often?
3648,"Not too often, it's more of a hobby. What do you do for fun?"
3648,"Generally just working out and stuff, and spending time with my family"
3648,I see. Are you into body building?
3648,I wouldn't go that far by any means haha. Im in the navy so well rounded fitness is fairly important
3648,"Cool. It's always good to exercise, it's a good way to get rid of stress"
3648,"Yeah definitely, I find it very relaxing. Getting it done with is a real sense of achievement as well"
3648,"I think more Americans need to exercise, the number of overweight people is very high compared to the past."
3648,"I've never been to America, I'm in England myself. I've heard a lot of American stereotypes about weight though"
3648,"Unfortunetly, with video games and other technologies you don't have to move around as much and it's hard to get active"
3649,thats nice
3649,You have kids?
3649,yes two kids what about you
3649,"I do not have any, not even marrried yet."
3649,Planning to get married soon
3649,"yes, i am engaged. so, you have any hobby?"
3649,"Not bad that's great. Yea, I do, I love travelling."
3649,ohh i love travelling as well. have you ever been to dubai? 
3650,I live pretty far from Texas. But we do have a lot of parks. A national park close by as well.
3650,"That's cool, I live in a small town in the middle of nowhere, loads of nice woodland walks round here"
3650,I love the forest. We have a lot of black bears and elk. What sort of wildlife do you have there?
3650,I'm in England so nothing quite as exciting as black bears! Deer is about as big as we have round here
3650,I've never been to England but I hope to sometime. It looks beautiful in photos. And I love the ocean. You have a lot of shoreline there.
3650,"Yeah I live about a 10 minute walk from a beach, it's easy to take it for granted"
3650,Yea. A lot of things in life are easy to take for granted. Maybe you could walk there later and enjoy it for me.
3650,"I'm away at work at the moment, not really within walking distance of anything sadly"
3650,"Oh, well maybe another time. "
3650,Yeah for sure! 
3650,It was nice chatting. I hope you find your way to the beach soon.
3650,You too! Thanks!
3651,Does that make you feel pressured to be successful?
3651,"Not especially, I think we can all be successful in our own ways"
3651,Do you have any favorite movies?
3652,what can we eat the eggs with?
3652,"I like them cut in half with a little salt on top, and some toast on the side."
3652,Nice idea and that won't be hard to prepare at all
3652,I could ask my mom for better suggestions. She's the best baker I know. 
3652,"That will be cool, I would love to have variety of the delicacy."
3652,"Have you ever tried deviled eggs? We cut boiled eggs in half, empty the yolks into a bowl and mix with spices, then put back in the egg. They're delicious."
3652,No! I haven't tried that before this sounds fun preparing and can't wait to taste it
3652,They're one of my favorite types of eggs. You should look up a recipe. They're very easy and cheap.
3652,Sure I will look for the recipes. Thanks for sharing. looking forward to having fun while preparing it.
3652,Do you have any favorite recipes I could try?
3652,No not really
3652,Ok well thanks for chatting
3653,"I did not, but they started to be pushy and chase me! I needed to run away from them"
3653,Did you call the police? 
3653,"I had no time, I started to run immediately and made sure that I would not catch me!"
3653,I'm glad you got away. Did you make your flight on time?
3653,"Literally ran to the airport! Thank god, I like jogging and do it on daily basis!"
3653,You must be in great shape. I love to hike.
3653,"Thank you, I am happy with my body! Hiking is so much more interesting than jogging! Where do you hike?"
3653,I live near the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. That's my favorite place to hike. It's considered a temperate rainforest and has so much wildlife.
3653,That sounds like a dreamland! I have been once there but i wish on other circumstances
3653,What is it like where you live?
3653,"Tall building, busy people and a lot of pollution - sounds familiar? "
3653,What country is that in? 
3654,I think its not bad
3654,Be sure to have it done in a tattoo shop. They will make sure it's done properly.
3654,Yeah tatoo shops do great work 
3654,Do you have any mods or piercings?
3654,Yeah i have piercings 
3654,I have 22 total but only 1 tattoo
3654,Wow i love it can you advice me the best piercings
3654,Naval would be easiest for a teenager. Piercing cartilage is risky.
3654,Ooh so you consider naval but what are the risks of piercing cartilage
3654,Permanent nerve damage is a risk with any cartilage piercing. 
3654,Ooh thanks for sharing the ideas to me
3654,You're welcome. I hope it goes well.
3655,Do you enjoy video games? I love them.
3655,Yea i love video games i played them all the time growing up
3655,What's your favorite kind?
3655,I am so into action games with a good story
3655,I enjoy world of warcraft. Have you played that?
3655,I have yes but I couldnt get into it. Do you like movies?
3655,I do! I live in the United States and Joker just came out. The acting was good but I didn't love the story.
3655,Me too. The storey was great but it was very dark. How often do you go the circus?
3655,Never. I think it's horrible the way circuses treat animals.
3655,I agree its not very kind. It can be fun though 
3655,It isn't for me. I wish it were illegal for them to hold animals captive.
3655,I understand. What other hobbies do yuou enjoy?
3656,I'm on a diet so I can't eat any of my fave food (pizza obviously!) :-(
3656,That's a shame! Pizza is my favorite food too! But dieting is important!
3656,"I know, I love nighttime but these days I just want to eat my sad little salad and go to sleep so I'm not thinking of food! "
3656,Have you considered finding a hobby or something to get over thinking about food?
3656,That's a good idea thanks! I've been trying to read but I might have to start getting out of the house more! Any suggestions??
3656,"Well since you are trying to lose weight, exercising could work! I personally like woodworking because I am creating something."
3656,"I just hate exercise! That sounds interesting, does woodworking burn many calories?? haha"
3656,You'd be suprised! I break up quite the sweat! It's no marathon but it does do a job! Also I made my desk like that so it's a win/win!
3656,Ah fantastic! I bet you're handy to have around! What else have you made?
3656,"Not much, it takes me ages for each creation. Working on a chair at the moment! I could teach you sometime!"
3656,"I'd love that! What's a good ""beginners project"" we can start with?"
3656,"I started with a spoon! It's small, and you'll break it loads of times, but it teaches you a lot! I still use my spoon almost every day!"
3657,"Sure, I can call my friends. But it's not the same spending real time face to face, you know"
3657,i had a good ly in this morning. did you get a good nights sleep
3657,"Not really, I was restless and got up early"
3657,Ah no. I love sleeping. I need to get my haircut today. You have nice hair?
3657,My hair is ok. How long is your hair?
3657,its quite long now but i need it cut. WHat styles do you like
3657,"Any style I guess, as long as it suits the person's personality"
3657,thats true. I like sriking styles. when did you last gets yours cut?
3657,Months ago. Sometime in summer
3657,wow thats along time ago. what other hobbies do uou have
3657,I like taking photos
3657,That sounds fun. Do you have a good camera?
3658,What do you mean a stand of their toes?
3658,"You know, on their toes! So I've heard. They love cake, do you too?"
3658,"I love cake.  Oh, I get it they stand on their toes."
3658,"I know, stupid joke! Yes, chocolate cake with frosting, like me too! I had a shepherd that loved cake."
3658,Don't give them chocolate because it is not good for them.
3658,I know. It was a treat every now and then. She loved sweets in general. Do you?
3658,I try to eat a health sweets. Fruits are nature candy.
3658,"Oh, she loved fruits too! And veggies! There was nothing she wouldn't eat, lol! Do you like to bake?"
3658,I do like to bake but try not to do it as much.
3658,"Good for you,eating healthy! I try as well. I bake during mostly holidays.How about you?"
3658,"Normally, I do this too. I like to make a fruit salad doing the holidays."
3658,"Fruit salad is so yummy! Sounds great! I love frosting more, but try to stay away. "
3659,Great fun!  How often do you ride them?
3659,Almost every week ends. And you?
3659,Not as often as I did before I had kids!  But I try to do every weekend as well.
3659,i would love to be able to have horses
3659,It's great but a lot of work!  I have three horses now and they take a lot of time up.
3659,"That is true! I bet it is taking a lot of time, you must be exhausted!"
3659,"Yes, I have the horses but also two sons, so its always chaotic in this house.  What about you, do you have any kids?"
3659,yes with 2 beautiful boys . we have a few horses too that we like to ride .
3659,"Lovely, how old are your two?  Do they enjoy riding too?"
3659,one is 5 and the elder one is 210.they enjoy riding so much
3659,"Mine are both in their teens, my younger one doesn't enjoy riding as much, he's more into football."
3659,he might grow to like riding.but football is still okay
3660,I loved going to the Statue of Liberty! It's so much bigger in person! When were you thinking of going?
3660,"Thats coo. I am a mother of 3, I wish i could go away more. When are you next away?"
3660,In June I'm going to chicago to see the family. Nothing major! You need to find somewhere you can go with your kids!
3660,I do. I am planning disney land but its so expensive. Do you have children?
3660,"Disneyland is worth every penny. I have one, she is in college now, so we do not see her as much."
3660,Which college does she go to?
3660,"Brown, in rhode island. How old are you kids?"
3661,"She deosn't think she is, but she is humble. She takes class 6 days a week."
3661,"Wow very intense, is she planning on making it her full time career?"
3662,"My favorite thing to draw is Anime.  I haven't really taken it seriously enough to make any money from it, its just my passion"
3662,"That's cool! Never known anyone who draws anime. I bet it pays a lot, if you ever get more into it."
3662,I'm sure it would. There are so many niche markets within Anime though so i'd need to get really good at a certain style
3662,Absolutely! Drawing people is so much easier and less daunting a task I think. I used to take photographs.
3662,"I started off tracing photographs through paper to get the basic lining down, then i would shade and contour myself"
3662,That's a great way to start! I do mostly portraits of individuals. I have a show this weekend. I'm so excited. What plans do you have this weekend?
3662,"Oh thats awesome!  I hope it goes well for you!  I'm doing an overnight camp tonight at the beach, then have a massage scheduled tomorrow"
3662,"Thank you, me too! I love the beach. Do you live near one?"
3662,"I do, i'm in Florida so theres a beach within 2 hours of me no matter where I'm at in the state"
3662,"You are so lucky! I hope you have an amazing time! I am in TX, nowhere near a beach, so jealous."
3662,"Ahh i almost became a Texan at one point... it was CA, TX or FL when we moved from Maryland and we chose FL"
3662,I've always wanted to go to CA.That's a huge jump from Maryland to FL! Was it a job relocation?
3662,"No, parents are old and retired while i was in HS... now ive been here 18 years and love it!"
3663,do you play any instrument?
3663,"Yes, I play the piano, I try to play once a week, but sometimes life gets in the way! Do you play any?"
3663,not really... how long are you learning piano?
3663,"It's been about ten years now, I really enjoy it, I find it so relaxing to play.  If you could choose an instrument to learn, which would you choose?"
3663,I might go with flute
3663,"Nice, I hope you get to learn to play it one day."
3663,"yea, I wish that too.. where do you live?"
3663,"I live in Scotland, what about you?  Do you have any pets?  I have a dog called Alfred."
3663,How the weather in Scotland. I am in Georgia USA. I don't have any pets only some fishes in aquarium 
3663,"Quite cold at the moment, what about in Georgia?  I've never visited the USA."
3663,"It's fall here. Not too bad, does not get too cold."
3663,That's nice that it doesn't get too cold.  What do you do for work?
3664,"yes it is. Shes great, She thinks the moon landing was faked. "
3664,"Oh a conspiracy theorist, are you one to?"
3664,"I am, there are too many unanswered questions. Sorry if i talk too fast, its a habit. "
3664,"No problem, its true there is a lot of unanswered questions"
3664,Do you believe in aliens?
3664,"Theirs probably aliens, It would have been cool if people actually raided area 51"
3664,"I nkow, i wanted to go to that. I want to know the truth "
3664,"Yeah, i think the government hides too much"
3664,Thats true. what are your other hobbies?
3664,I like programming and playing videogames
3664,What types of games do you like? I like action ones
3664,"I like fps games, do you like racing games?"
3665,Wow! That's a lot more than I imagined! Guess I need to read more!
3665,"You should, its worth a read, they're such interesting animals.  I'd love to see one in the wild one day."
3665,They are definatly my favorite animal! Gorillas scare me though! Do you have a favorite animal?
3665,"Definetly dogs, I love dogs, I'd love to get one but I have a roommate so wouldn't be fair on her.  Do you have any poets"
3665,"I'm a cat kind of girl! Obviously if I could have a monkey I would, but it would not be fair on them! they need to live free"
3665,"I've never had a cat before, we were always a dog family when I was growing up. Cats do seem adorable though."
3665,"Because of how much I'm outside the house, cats are good. They take care of themselves but are still affectionate when I'm in the house. Cuddly sweeties."
3665,Yes they're quite independent compared to dogs.  Is it for your work that you are out the house quite a bit?
3665,Yeah I work as a consultant so I'm out a lot. Spend several days out sometimes in other cities. What do you do for work?
3665,"I'm training to become a plumber.  You're job sounds very interesting, getting to travel lots!"
3665,Yeah! It's hard to live a normal life though always moving. That's awesome! how many more years of training do you have?
3665,"I'll be finishing next year, so hoping to get a full time job then and move out to a place of my own. "
3666,"Yes I do, but not a lot since I get benefits because of my blindness. you>?"
3666,No.  Sorry to hear that. I wear glasses - I enjoy picking them out from a designer collection?
3666,"Ah, you have branded glasses? That's very cool! What color are they?"
3666,"I have several colors,  red, blue, black... My fav are  louis vuittons."
3666,Oh those are fancy! I once saved up for a LV handbag! Very amazing brand. 
3666,Yes.  LV is fun.  Do you have any medical treatments to help you see?
3666,Yeah I use drips in one eye. the other is kind of beyond repair so there is not much I can do. You ever consider laser eye surgery ?
3666,Yes.  I have considered RK.  I hate medical procedures.  Had a bad experience with botox.
3666,Oh no! Sorry to hear that! It's always scared me. What happened if you don't mind me asking.
3666,"An infection, lot's of swelling...  It was around my eyes...  Noting as bad as what you have been through. "
3666,"Wow! That sounds rough! To be honest I was born like this, so I've never known better. I think yours is worse since you went through real pain."
3666,It was a little painful - now I'm afraid to get a haircut...
3667,"I have my suspicions, but no, I don't know for certain."
3667,"That's horrible, I'm so sorry. I hope it was a one time thing only. You should have cameras monitoring."
3667,"I'm sure the culprit doesn't feel good about it, I don't want to know the reason behind it. Cameras in bathrooms is weird no?"
3667,"Yes,weird in the bathroom itself,but not outside to monitor who goes in and out. They probably did it on purpose."
3667,"Mayhaps, we could play detective with that indeed. For now this will remain in the history as ""The Great Clog""."
3667,I'd love to play detective! I play lots of video games when not working at the factory.Do you play?
3667,Oh yes of course! I love them! Which one is your favourite one at the moment?
3667,"LOTRO, although more of an MMO than a typical ""video game"". Do you play ever?"
3667,I love RPGs or puzzle games. I play a lot of Diablo.
3667,"Puzzle games are great! I love Sodoku, Wordfind, Crossword, etc. I've never played Diablo. I've played lotro,wow,d&d,etc."
3667,Uuu! D&D! I always wanted to try that!
3667,"Not many ppl play these days.It's more old school I think, but so much fun! You should try it one day! You'd love it!"
3667,I most definitely will! I watched a few sessions and it looked super fun.
3667,"It can be, especially if you have the right ppl to play with. What else do you do for fun?"
3667,Mostly video games and comic books.
3667,Comic books are great! DC or Marvel? Have you read The Walking Dead comic books? They are great!
3667,Personally... DC. I haven't read TWD. I am actually trying to finish out the series at the moment.
3667,"I'm more a Marvel girl, but I do love some of the DC stuff. I watch TWD series too! That Negan guy, wow!"
3667,It's a great series so far I love how the characters are depicted and the overall atmosphere. Do you have a recommendation for a movie?
3667,"Exactly! I love TWD and FTWD. You should watch the trilogy of Unbreakable,Split,& Glass!"
3667,Noted! I trust your recommendations.
3668,Of course! It's important to teach them!
3668,How do you discipline them when they poop in the house?  I typically shame mine by yelling and making them follow me over to the scene of the crime
3668,I get his nose very close to the poop. Show him that what he's done is wrong!  Your dog poop in the house often?
3668,"Not often but when she does, she will eat it to hide the evidence, then proceed to throw it up all over the house.  It'"
3668,"Turning one crime, into an even worse one. Dogs are cute. They want to please us and mess up, adorable. I'm sure they mean well"
3668,"I know, my spouse thinks its sweet that the dog feels bad about it, i do to but im more annoyed at just how gross the situation is lol"
3668,"What's the worth thing she's done? Mine has ripped up my favorite handbag! But hell, still love her!"
3668,The poop then subsequent eating of it is the worst really.... shes a good dog overall
3668,What breed is she?
3668,"Shes a yorkie-poo (mini yorkie and mini poodle mixed)...i was never a dog person until this one, now ill never have any other pet"
3668,"Oh they are so snuggly! That's very cute! Yeah, my dog is the best friend I've ever had. And she likes all the same Netflix shows as me haha"
3668,"What kind is yours? I feel like mine does too since thats all we do is watch netflix! I want to get another, medium ""doodle"
3669,"Yea me too, i love star trek. I cant wait for the new amazon prime series"
3669,Same here! Star Trek has always been one of my favorite shows.
3669,What food you into? I am addicted to prezels.
3669,"I really like pizza! I should probably cut back on it though, haha! "
3669,Me too. its so nice. What other hobbies do you have?
3669,I love listening to music. Have you ever heard of the muggers? They are my absolute favorite!
3669,i havent but i am interested in finding out. I like pun rock 
3669,very cool! who are some of your favorite punk rock bands?
3669,of all time probably green day. Not a fan of their new stuff though . You go to many concerts?
3669,Not really. I can't really afford to go to many! I have seen the muggers a few times though! How bout you
3669,I love festivals like leeds festival but it is very expensive
3669,I'd love to go to a festival one day! They always sound like so much fun! Do you go to a lot of festivals?
3670,"I'm a bartender, and you?"
3670,I am a computer systems engineer
3670,Oh wow! That sounds complicated! Bet your family always ask you for tech support ahha!
3670,"not as complicated as it sounds. youtube easily teaches you what I spent 3 years at college learning, lol"
3670,Ha! Youtube is such a great resource. You ever think about making videos yourself?
3670,"well yh but not about the techy stuff. I would  do vlogging, I like to get out there and experience the finer things in life"
3670,That's cool! You should give it a shot! Otherwise you might end up regretting it later on in life if you don't give it a shot now.
3670,"yh i'll try my best and see where it gets me, so how often do you get drunk on the job lol."
3670,On the job nearly never! It's really not as fun as it sounds! But at closing that's a different story!  What's your favorite alcohol?
3670,"not really a drinker but if i have to describe it, i'll say am a curious taster, if the bottle looks good enough i'll give it a try "
3670,I do that with wine! Love trying different ones! #
3670,"cool, so how long have you been a bartender"
3671,Sad! Is there any particular reason?

3671,Wow! That is my favourite too!
3671,really!! Thats really awesome.I enjoy while listening to some music
3671,Yes!!! What is your favourite song while eating?
3671,I prefer vinyl records
3671,Wow! Great
3671,I think they are awesome
3672,Mostly I enjoy puttering around in my garden.
3672,Sounds like a great hobby. I could see this being an activity I'd do for enjoyment.
3672,I really like to grow my own herbs and spices that I use in my cooking.
3672,Really? What sort of cooking do you like to do?
3672,"Well, since the doctor said I have diabetes I've been preparing low-carb and keto meals."
3672,"I like baking desserts, and my favorite is blueberry pie."
3672,Do you do the cooking on holidays like Christmas or Thanksgiving?
3672,Yes love them both! I start baking every Thanksgiving riht after my morning run.
3672,"Mmm, your house must smell wonderful. Do you usually make a turkey on Thanksgiving?"
3672,"Yes, with fresh garlic and stuffing. Do you also prepare a turkey?"
3672,I don't tend to follow tradition. I will make a chili or pizza for big family dinners.
3672,"Different, but sounds good too. I also have this thing where I have to wear my favorite blue apron."
3673,I love going to the casino!
3673,"Yes, me too! My husband and I go once a month to OK, it's an hr away!"
3673,We go every weekend. He is taking me to Vegas for our 6 year anniversary! 
3673,Awesome! Happy Anniversary to you guys! I hope you have an amazing time. Do you guys have kids?
3673,Thanks! We do not have kids. We went through IVF but it wasn't successful. You?
3673,"I'm sorry to hear that. We tried for 7 yrs as well. Three failed IUI's and 1x at IVF, and by some wonder it worked. We have a sweet boy."
3673,That is amazing. I guess kids weren't in the cards for us..yet. =) Only time will tell. We might adopt. All kids needs love!
3673,Exactly! We were about to begin the adoption process and then found out we were expecting.Had a girl naturally after him.
3673,This is such a small world...you and I having the same fertility issues. Go Amazon! So where do you live?
3673,"I know crazy! I only know 1 other person that did IVF! The struggle is real, so many emotions you go through. I live in TX. And you?"
3673,I live in Louisiana. We are neighbors!! How cool is that!
3673,"Sweet! Very cool! I love LA, only been a few times. Have you ever been to TX?"
3673,I have been to TX. I would love to go to San Antonio. 
3673,"San Antonio is nice, the Riverwalk is interesting.They have a bat thing they do once a year, in August I think, very cool!"
3673,I will have to make it a point to go visit. Well it was nice chatting with you. Off to do more HITS!
3673,"You too! Me as well, happy HITTING, LOL!"
3674,I suppose it would be different for every individual.
3674,"Yes you're right, varies from person to person.  It's crazy the damage alcohol can do to someone."
3674,A lot more than most people might imagine. I'm actually also a recovering alcoholic myself.
3674,How long have you been sober?  
3674,Only about 6 months really. I'm having trouble to be honest. Every day is a trial.
3674,"It's always a battle, but you've come so far, 6 months is great, I hope you continue to do well."
3674,"Thank you for that, I really appreciate it. My drinking actually cost me my marriage. It's been pretty hard."
3674,"I'm so sorry to hear that, stay strong.  Do you have any family supporting you?"
3674,"Not really, I chat with my mom occasionally online, however all of my family live too far away for me to meet them in person.  "
3674,"Obviously it's no replacement for seeing each other in person, but online chat is great, I use it to chat to my kids."
3674,"I'm alone in my condo most of my free time these days, my drinking cost me both my marriage and my house. Well, had to sell the house after separating."
3674,"That's tough, but you're recovering now.  Have you thought about doing some hobbies or fitness to get out each day?"
3675,"It's really my least favorite these days, I don't like the direction the genre has taken overall."
3675,me neither. I would much rather just have a good arm wrestle haha
3675,You like to have a good arm wrestle? You must be super swole.
3675,I try to be! I work out a lot. do you?
3675,"A little bit, I don't have to try too hard though. I'm 6 ft so that's like an instant right swipe these days."
3675,I bet. You into guys or girls? 
3675,"Girls, duh. What about you?"
3675,Same. Do you like bagels?
3675,I like to get an everything bagel from time to time. I prefer donuts though.
3675,"yea me too, i need to cut down. What other hobbies you have?"
3675,I like to play guitar and watch anime. I'm a borderline otaku it's so embarrassing.
3675,"ah nice, i wish i learnt guitar, is it hard"
3675,Yeah it's hard I'm no good at it at all but it's still fun.
3675,you male or famale
3675,Male.
3676,Its going good
3676,Your hope and perserverance will take you really far in life I am sure.
3676,Thanks for the kind words
3676,Every wish you could just run away from the world and live with the animals?
3676,yes
3676,I like animals much better than I like people. Especially dogs. 
3676,Yeah i love dogs
3676,Do you have any dogs? I have a husky and a german.
3676,"Not right now, i used to have one. If you could own a wild animal what would it be?"
3676,"Oh, interesting question. I think I would want to own a sloth. Or maybe an alpaca lol"
3676,arent sloths the animal that sleep all day?
3676,"Yeah, so are dogs. That's okay because I still have to go to work every day."
3676,do you enjoy your work
3677,"Yea, i feel the same way. Work is the worst."
3677,yh I pretty much do what I can to get by.
3677,Same. would rather not work my life away but you got to do what you got to do.
3677,yup wanted to start a business but at this point in my life its a bit too risky 
3677,"Oh, definitely a risky venture. I have thoughts about that striking out on my own as well but can't really make that happen with a family to worry about."
3678,Yeah! Good things still happen!
3678,This is true! I joined the military early in life so I didnt have to accrue college debt and just used my GI Bill. I did need 2 small loans
3678,My respects to you for serving.
3678,"Thank you, the experience was a net positive. I wouldnt do it again but i would recommend others do it if they are on the fence about joining"
3678,Do the habits learned there stick to you afterwards?
3678,"Some do, such as me being up at 5AM on a saturday.  I also use the 24 hour clock exclusively because it really does make much more logical sense"
3678,I wish I was so prompt with my awakening on a Saturday morning.
3678,I wake up between 0500-0600 every single day.  My backup alarm has the best job in the world because i NEVER have to use it
3678,I envy you. I have to start being more disciplined. 
3678," It's a blessing and a curse to be honest. I used to sleep in to 1200 on weekends regularly, now I can't even sleep in til 0900"
3678,More time to do stuff I suppose. What do you like doing in your spare time?
3678,"I do geocaching in my spare time, camp, road cycling, and I make rings from old silver/gold coins as a side hustle."
3678,Huh you sound like a really interesting person. Camping sounds so much fun!
3678," I'm just getting into it, i bought a tent for the bed of my truck and a fitted air mattress so im off the ground and mobile. its great"
3679,"I do love animal, especially dogs. Do you have any dogs?"
3679,yes i love animals . dogs are my favorite !
3679,"I have a Husky and a German Shepherd. Boy, they sure have a lot of energy!"
3679,I currently dont have any but i used to have a pug
3679,"Oh, pugs are cute. Do you have any pets right now?"
3679,"Sadly, no"
3679,"What do you like to do for fun? I live on the West Coast, I love to surf and swim."
3679,I like to watch movies and code
3679,Do you listen to music when you are coding?
3679,yeah
3679,What kind of music do you like to listen to?
3679,I like pop and rap
3680,"Not sure about horse meat!  But I love shrimp and lobster, do you like seafood? "
3680,"I do! As the mother and main meal maker in the family, I serve some kind of seafood to the family at least once a week."
3680,I'm jealous that you eat seafood once a week!  What is your favorite drink? 
3680,"I think that would have to be a nice dry red wine, something like a Shiraz. Great with pasta or steak."
3680,"I love red wine too, but I think my favorite drink has got to be an iced coffee, I have one every morning. "
3680,Nice! How do you like your iced coffee? I drink mine black these days...
3680,"I like mine with milk and a drop of either maple syrup or honey, love the sweetness it gives."
3680,"It's strange, I always drank my coffee with sugar and milk until I became a teacher, then I tried strong black coffee and never turned back."
3680,How long have you been a teacher?
3680,Only about 8 years actually. I got married straight out of high school and had kids but I studied part time the whole way through.
3680,"Is it high school you teach?  I thought about training to become a teacher for a while, but I never did do it."
3680,I teach elementary. 5th graders at the moment. My kids are both in high school now though!
3681,I frequently had to fend for myself as child.
3681,"oh really, so you were bullied alot?"
3681,"Not really, just had to survive in a tough environment."
3681,yh  we live in a harsh world
3681,"That is true, but it also gave me the opportunity to learn many things."
3681,"yup, thats the thing about life, we learn from our experiences"
3681,Our experiences shape and form who we really are as we go through life.
3681,yes thats what in most cases makes us who we are
3681,What experiences have you encountered that are positive influences in your life?
3681,just me meeting influential people at the right moments
3681,"That's great, hopefully those meeting have led to very successful outcomes."
3681,"yes they have, what about you"
3682,"I like to read and cook, how about you?"
3682,I love to im a great baker 
3682,Are you a professional bake or is it just a hobby?
3682,"i used to be professional but now just for fun, too much hassle"
3682,Why was it too much of a hassle? I bet customers don't appreciate the effort huh.
3682,exactly and very long hours but not enough money. Wht do you do
3682,"I'm a beautician, I love working and styling hair. Right now I'm experimenting with blond highlights with red hair."
3682,that sounds rewarding! you hair great hair i reckon?
3682,I try to make it as fabulous as possible but I wouldn't say it's anything special. 
3682,I bet youre being modest. I bet you have great talents
3682,"I'm an amateur chef, I guess. I'm not very good at it but I enjoy it."
3682,"Its good to give it a shot, i bet we have a budding masterchef on our hands eh.."
3682,Probably not but thanks.
3682,I bet youll do great. Are you male or female?
3682,"Male, why?"
3683,"True. Sometimes people worry I'm crazy because I talk to my dog so much, and answer for her too, lol."
3683,"Ha, the answering part is where they might think youre crazy.  My wife talks to ours like the dog is a real life baby"
3683,"Lol, I can totally relate! I am a really bad liar, and think my dog even instinctively picks up on that too."
3683,Haha! They are very intuitive animals so i dont doubt it. Do you like to swim at all? I love it and our dog swims with me too
3683,"Yes, love to swim, and so does my dog. Is your dog a rescue as well?"
3683,Sort of.  She belonged to my sister in law who left the dog outside all the time so we took her in to give her what she deserves
3683,"Oh, that's so sad the dog was neglected, but good you all were there to take it in."
3683,"Yeah, she got hit by a golf cart from being outside all the time and that was the last straw.  We spoil the crap out of her nowadays"
3683,"Poor thing. Well, I'm sure all the love she gets now has made her forget all about it."
3683,I think/hope so.  This dog turned me from a cat person to a dog person.  I cant wait to get another that i can raise from a puppy
3683,"I have a cat as well, and spoil both the cat and dog, lol."
3683,I love cats still but my SO is allergic and i developed a mild allergy over the years too so no more cats as pets for us
3684,I really enjoy listening to heavy metal. What kind of music do you like?
3684,I enjoy music that I can learn from.    Like music that has history.   
3684,Oh wow that's interesting. I guess you enjoy documentaries too then?
3684,I adore documentaries!   Whats your favorite band?
3684,Iron Maiden for sure. I like any old-school metal like Judas Priest and Cinderella.
3684,"Thats awesome!   I never really got into metal, but I hear a lot of it where i work.   Have you seen concerts?"
3684,"I do go to a lot of concerts. Now that I'm getting older, I really should wear some earplugs."
3684,You definitely should.    What was your favorite concert to date?
3684,My all-time favorite was Metallica and Guns n Roses at Lollapallooza in the 1990s
3684,I like to read the stories and backgrounds of the metal groups.  
3684,Some of the bands come from really interesting backgrounds. I heard Gwar was made up of lawyers.
3684,What?   That's crazy!   Have you watched the movie about Motley Crew?
3685,"Very true. You get an organic, collaborative story in tabletop. Video games are more directed in most cases. Though i love both experiences."
3685,"As do I. I'm a lifeguard by day, super geek by night. I always loved fantasy."
3685,How long have you been a lifeguard?
3685,"For the last 2 years, I love my job. "
3685,That's great. Sounds like a rewarding job.
3685,If you have passion for what you're doing it's always rewarding. I try to not get into things that I do not honestly enjoy.
3685,"Yea, i'd love for my career to be rewarding like that. Currently, my hobbies only fulfill that void. Work by day, and code indie games at night."
3685,What game are you coding at the moment?
3685,Just working on a deck-building roguelike at the moment. Simple and something I can do on my own.
3685,Oh hell yes! Like Slay the Spire? I absolutely love those. I love roguelike games especially.
3685,"Yea, Slay the spire is great and an inspiration. I love making and playing roguelikes."
3685,"Roguelikes just make everything so much better, decisions hold weight, and everything is overall more intense. I'd be interested to see your finished product."
3686,"Exactly, I love to hunt too, so that helps stock the freezer up. "
3686,"oh really, what do you normally hunt for"
3686,"Mostly deer, my kids are getting a bit older now so hoping they will join me soon.  Do you hunt?"
3686,nah i dont
3686,You should try it sometime.   Do you have any children?
3686,"nope, not as yet, what do you do for work"
3686,"I'm a farmer, what about you?"
3686,"just left college, currently um employed"
3686,Hopefully you will get a job soon!  What did you study at college?
3686,computer systems engineering
3686,"That's very interesting and sounds difficult, did you enjoy studying it?"
3686,it had it ups n downs but i didnt drop out so you could say yh i enjoyed it
3687,"very good, still learning the company's culture, can't really complain"
3687,oh wow that's so cool . certainly job security in this age .
3687,"oh yes , I count myself among the lucky ones. Getting into some of these fortune 500 companies doesn't come by easy. "
3687,Yes that is the truth!  I race cars for a living so I wouldn't know.
3687,"oh really, you've been doing it for long. I love watching people race cars just can't do it myself"
3687,Are you a fan of Nascar?  That's my dream.
3687,"Not really, but I watch once in a while. Good for you"
3687,What do you do for fun?
3687,"I like to run, just don't have that much time to do it because of work"
3687,You must stay busy and like your job.
3687,"yea, I don't a choice since I'm still new at the job. I also enjoy spending time with my family anytime I can"
3687,Yes family is the most important thing.  That's why we do it right?
3687,"yes, you can't do no wrong spending as much time as you can with them"
3688,"Wow, I"
3688,How about you? What you do for living?
3688,I work for an investment banker.
3688,Interesting... how its like to be an investment banker?
3688,"Great, I get to spend other peoples money and make money at the same time."
3688,"that is a big responsibility, you might impact so many people's lives.."
3688,Maybe but hopefully we all benefit and make money in the end.
3688,"yes, that will be a win win situation.... do you have pick the stock for the investors?"
3688,"Mostly ETF's and Mutual Funds, it's a shared decision."
3688,do you need to manage a investment portfolio ?
3688,"Yes, I do that frequently with some input from the investor."
3688,is this a stressful job?
3688,"Not at all, when your portfolio is gaining like it has this year."
3689,I told her that I had my own apartment.   
3689,That is tough. She will eventually find out the truth.
3689,"Eventually, but I'm trying to level up in my computer game, and I can do that at my parents house."
3689,Is your computer game more important to you than your girlfriend? You might have some life choices to make here.
3689,"Well, I'm trying to save money, so I play online, and live with my parents."
3689,If you need to gather more money you might consider what you can do with your spare time that will lead to some income.
3689,I wish I had passion for work like I do my computer games.
3689,"A lot of people who are working do not have a real passion for work, many of us are doing what we have to do."
3689,"There has to be a job out there for everyone, that inspires them, and makes them happy."
3689,"Yes, maybe there is. But you may have to do what you have to do to get your own place."
3689,"My parents travel a lot, so I am home by myself 90% of the time anyway."
3689,Well then do you plan to lie to your girlfriend and tell her it is your place?
3689,Probably.    I mean it will be my own place one day.
3690,"Just a random question, do you like meat? "
3690,"I love meat. My fave is steak, i eat too much . "
3690,"I'm a vegan, have been since I was in high school. Just wondering, what is it about meat that you like?"
3690,"the taste, everything really. I am so into star trek, do you watch it "
3690,Star Trek? A little. In terms of Sci Fi I must say that I'm more of a Stargate and Star Wars fan myself..

3697,It sounds lovely. I can't wait until it is my time to have kids.
3698,yeah
3698,It's rough when you have to get to know each other and pretend to care even if you don't.
3698,"I get you, I think I need to take a break soon."
3698,Yeah maybe some time apart would help things improve.
3698,"definitely, most likely will go hunting, you should try it."
3698,Yeah take your mind off things with something you enjoy. Not something that really interests me.
3698,"Ah ok. Might take some of the guys along, got a huge truck with some space"

3699,"I only have sisters, and wish I had a brother all the time."
3699,Why would you have preferred a brother?
3699,"Well, it's just not that easy being the only boy, and if it were not for my love of chocolate would not have much in common with my sisters, lol."
3699,"haha, I think having siblings would of helped with my self esteem, I'm a harsh critic of myself. "
3699,"Yeah, I can't really imagine no siblings, but imagine it's lonely at times."
3699,When I was growing up it was lonely and I didn't have a great reputation as people thought I was aloof.

3699,"No, but I'm trying to work on it now, so hopefully things will change."
3699,I wish you all the best for sure.
3700,Couldn't you get hurt really bad?
3700,"Well, that is always a possibility. I've always found that if you go in hard, you don't get hurt. If you hesitate, that's when you get an injury."
3700,I like soccer...less chance of getting hit by a stick but I do like field hockey too
3700,"Soccer bores me after a while, not enough scoring! I can see why soccer fans get into big fights! Too much tension building up!"
3700,They could throw a couple dogs in the game that would liven it up. I love dogs.
3700,I like dogs too! I have a thing for pugs. How about you? What kind of dogs do you like?
3700,My neighbor has pitbulls and they are adorable...even though they've been given a bad rap. My son has a yellow lab and he is a sweetheart
3700,then it will be aggressive...
3700,"true, they treat their dogs like their babies"
3700,"I have 2 sisters and one of them has a staffy pitbull, very similar. Amazingly sweet and placid dog."
3700,they love to play but they can get rough not meaning to
3700,"That's true, they do have that lockjaw ability. They are very strong doggies. "
3701,I like to read and go biking and on nature walks
3701,i like to dance and gaming
3702,so do you like working in groups?
3702,"No, I really don't like other people lol. I prefer my animals."
3702,Yes I love it too. Do you dance?
3702,I do like to dance! There is a barn dance every month that my wife and I go to.
3702,That's cool! 
3702,Most of my time is spent caring for my cows and chickens on the farm. What do you do for fun?
3702,That's cool! what kind of gaming?
3702,I mostly play games on my phone. Do you have a game console?
3702,No. I have a baby girl so she takes up most of my time for games.
3702,Oh that's nice. How old is she?
3703,The room is much nicer with better facilities for me to use.
3703,"That's nice. I'm actually still living with my parents, so my living situation has been the same for a while."
3703,Yeah do you like living with them?
3703,"I do, yeah. I can save up a lot of money but also still indulge quite a bit in my hobbies. "
3703,Yeah always helps the money situation when living with them.
3703,It does. Are you enjoying your college experiece?
3703,Yeah it's good hard work but will be worth it in the end.
3703,It is very much worth it in the long run.
3703,Yeah hopefully it will get me a good job.
3703,"That's what college is for, after all! What kind of job do you want to get?"
3703,I'm looking to become a computer programmer.
3703,that will be a great job ! i bet you'll make a lot of money .
3704,That's cool. What is your town like? It is easy to drive there?
3704,Well its agricultural crops and forest and no traffic which is heaven to me makes it much easier to drive about.
3704,Yeah I live in a big city because of work so it is not really fun to drive.
3704,"Yeah, does the traffic get bad where you are ?"
3704,"It is very bad. There is never a good time of day to run errands or anything. I wish I could drive more, my dogs like the car."
3704,I love dogs myself. I have one called Jynx.
3704,"I have a brother and sister dog, Bow Bow and Tiger. I do not have cats."
3704,Yeah I'm not really a cat person.
3704,Whew. I am relieved you are not! I am not and now I say so ha ha.
3704,Lol do you like movies at all?
3704,Sure. I like thrillers that are not gross and bloody. How about you?
3704,i love scarry movies alot  my favourite movie though is goodfellas
3705,Are you going to any parties on Halloween night?>
3705,nah dont know yet
3705,"Ah okay, do you have any other plans for that night?"
3705,"besides stay home, most likely not, what about you"
3705,"I'm thinking of going trick or treating, starting to feel too old for it now though"
3705,so you have a sweet tooth
3705,"Yeah but really my favourite thing is strawberries and chocolate, what kind've sweets do you like?"
3705,"lolipops, anything sour"
3705,"Wow okay, we really are opposites then"
3705,yh dont get me wrong i like sweets too
3705,"Yeah fair enough, since you're staying in on Halloween are you going to give sweets to the kids or turn all the lights off and pretend you're not home"
3705,because of where i live i doubt any child will be coming to my door
3706,"26, wow.  Do you have and assistant?  My one and only sister does that."
3706,"Yes, but only part time, and it's keeping their attention that's the real trick."
3706,I bet there are a lot of problems with a class that size.  I've taught at a university and keeping the attention is an issue there too.
3706,"Yeah, I bet. The school I teach at is very large with a lot of chaos."
3706,Where abouts is that?  CA?  I was born in San Francisco...
3706,I was born and raised in Kansas City.
3706,"OK, I know it well... I'm a Chiefs fan.  So your school in in KC MO? "
3706,"No, it's a about an hour away. I am a Chiefs fan too!"
3706,I have been for years. Royals too.   My parents ended up moving to KS.  
3706,My wife is from KS.
3706,I'm glad my parents moved.  I would be a very different person if I were raised in CA.
3706,"Yeah, that's nothing like the midwest I'm sure."
3707,Well it was a stunt from my bed. I'm actually confined to my bed. 
3707,How did you break your leg from your bed?

3707,I like to go explore nature and national parks.
3707,That sounds fun. Do you go alone or with a friend or pets?
3707,"Both, it depends on the occasion."
3707,Cool. I love when my pets come and visit in my room while I'm stuck in bed.
3707,"Yes, animals are our best friends and they bring us much happiness."
3707,What kind of pets do you have?
3707,I have two chihuahuas mixes and one old grumpy cat.
3707,I love grumpy cat on youtube! I have two Great Danes
3707,"Yeah, Grumpy cat is great and Great Danes are cool as well."

3708,That is difficult.  My son didn't experience until age 10.
3708,do you have any other children
3708,just my son . what do you do in your spare time ?
3708,i like the play sports with my twin sister jessica
3708,"Oh wow, sports is a great way to exercise, I love to dance, its always been my passion"

3708,me too!!! i hope that you have a wonderful weekend. 
3708,You as well. Have a great day.
3709,I'm a vegetarian so I haven't eaten pork in many years now.
3709,IS there anything on your diet that tastes like pork?
3709,"No unfortunately, sometimes I have tofu with a BBQ marinade that tastes a little like it, but other than that, nothing really!"
3709,I have heard of vegan bacon. Never tried it. You should try it and let me know what you think!
3709,"I didn't know there was any, I will have to find some, I'd be really interested in seeing what it tastes like. "
3709,I wonder if there are any recipes to make it at home?
3709,"I once saw a YouTube video where they made vegetarian bacon out of cheese and smoked paprika, but I tried it and it was nothing like bacon! "
3709,I wouldve never guessed those were the ingredients! 
3709,It was very unusual!  So how many hours do you work on the farm each day?
3709,"It all depends on what the daily chores are. Some days it can be relaxed, other days I can go straight through the next day."
3709,I guess the variety of each day being different makes it a great job?  
3709,"It keeps things interesting, its not very monotonous!"
3710,They did. They said they got really sick the night before. 
3710,Aww thats to bad what were you going to do?
3710,"I think we were going to go to the arcade to play games, because I still like to do that. "
3710,nice! i like the arcade games as well.
3710,What other things do you enjoy doing with your free time?
3710,I love swimming how about you?
3710,I really enjoy cooking in my free time. 
3710,Really? What sort of cooking do you like to do? I love to cook.
3710,I really like making fresh pasta. It's so rewarding. Do you have a favorite recipe you like to make?
3710,i like pasta a lot as well. I love a good curry though.
3710,Oh yum. I'm still on the hunt for a good curry recipe. 
3710,Yeah you can find loads online these days. 
3711,I hate sprouts.
3711,Oh yes sprouts are pretty nasty! Do you like to exercise?
3711,Yeah I like to exercise at least 2 times a week if I can.
3711,I get really down if I don't exercise a lot so I really like bicycling. Plus it saves me money getting around.
3711,Yeah it helps you get fit and save money. I love to ski. 
3711,I will bike in my busy town but I am too scared to ski. I feel like I will get hurt. Have you ever been hurt skiing?
3711,"A few minor injuries nothing major though. Although i ski down high hills , i have a fear of heights."
3711,You must like the adrenaline rush because that sounds really gutsy.
3711,Yeah it is good makes you feel alive.
3711,Ok. You've convinced me. I am going to try skiing if I get the chance.
3711,Yeah give it a go you never know you might love it.
3711,To be honest I also thought skiing was too expensive. Can you rent the equipment?
3712,"it was such a mess, but I did not break the bowl!"
3712,That sound great. Breaking the bowl would have been costly.
3712,have you broken anything?
3712,"Well, figuratively, I break legs!"
3712,ouch! What is it that you do?
3712,To break a leg is a metaphoric speech.. It means to do things exceptionally!
3712,that is incredible! I apologize for not catching that sooner.
3712,No problem.. Do you have special skills?
3712,I like to draw and I think I am okay at it. What about you?
3712,I love drawings too. ut I appreciate works of art done by others more.
3712,"i definitely appreciate a good artist. Art is so subjective, I am so glad that you love it, too!"
3712,I agree. Do you do it for the money or the fun of it?
3713,it can be difficult to balance a job and raising a child
3713,Definitely! I'm finding it hard enough to manage my 3.
3713,i dont have any myself but my mother found it challenging without a job
3713,"I'm probably heading for a fourth child next year. I wouldn't mind having a career, but my kids are still young and there's really a lot involved."
3713,"specially when the kids are young, they really need their parents there for support"
3713,"Yes! I really think so! I have friends that put their kids into daycare from a young age, but I worry the kids aren't bonding with their parents!"
3713,"and the daycare fees can get too expensive, the parents can also get too nervuse being seperated from their new child aswell"
3713,How many kids do you think that you would like to have? If you have a family.
3713,"i would like to have 2 kids, a boy and a girl, and maybe even more if it goes well"
3713,"Nice, I have two girls and a little boy. 3 kids is proving to be a challenge though. Funnily enough, people say 4 is easier..."
3713,"how spaced out are your kids, i cant imagine having 3 newborns at the same time"
3713,"Ah, no twins or anything like that. Mine are currently 3, 5 and almost 7"
3714,"yeah we are one of those, it's actually going great for everyone"
3714,"I'm glad everyone enjoys working there. If you could work one low wage position, what would it be?"
3714,"In my workplace, I would typically chose any. Everyone has a great time working"
3714,That's so good to hear. Are you currently hiring? 
3714,"Definitely, there are a few free slots. My son is also looking to join when he's old enough"
3714,Good - He's a very hard working so I'm sure he will be good for the business side of things.
3714,"True, i try to get him to be as independent as possible, he just finished college"
3714,That is great. What college did he attend? 
3714,He went to one in Cambridge
3714,That is fantastic. Tell him to keep working hard !
3714,"I'm sure to, me and my wife are so pleased that he no longer depends on us so much"
3714,Does he have his own apartment? I live on my own right now. 
3715,Oh wow. That's great. I'm so terrified of heights. 
3715,We have plenty of trees to climb near the farm.
3715,Do you live on a farm?
3715,"Yes I do, and it's great place to live if you enjoy small town life."
3715,Does it get gold there? I prefer to live where the weather gets cold. 
3715,It does in the winter with frequent snowfall.
3715,That must be so pretty. Do you make snow angels or snowmen? 
3715,Sometimes I do but I really do love the hikes in the snow.
3715,What else do you like to do with your free time?
3715,"I pretty much spend my free time outdoors whether it's camping, backpacking, or just exploring nature."
3715,That sounds really nice. I really like to cook and try out new recipes in my free time. 
3715,What is your favorite meal to cook?
3716,thats great! how much did you win?
3716,"I won about 82,000 but I ended up splitting it with someone else."
3716,bought the ticket together?
3716,"kind of. I joked with the cashier if I won I would share, so I had to hold my word.  Do you have any hobbies?"
3716,Im really into race cars and I like to work out 
3716,"that's cool! I really enjoy racing  but I do not work out, hahah"
3716,"lol, yeah its not for everyone"
3716,"fortunately , i got into great shape and that helped . do you win races alot?"
3716,"Well I dont race them myself, Im more into the sport. But I have driven one once, it was exhilarating!"
3716,that is so exciting for you! I hope that you get the chance to race more!
3716,So do I! What are your hobbies?
3716,I like to try  new things. There are different skill levels and types of training one can take also.
3717,"My favorite colors are all in the blue range. Aqua, Navy, etc."
3717,That's interestings. Colors can have an influence on people.
3717,I agree. I like to wear blue colors as they make me more calm. Wearing red makes me more agressive.
3717,That makes sense. One of the fifth grade students that I teach told me he wears red on days that he is extra tired.
3717,"That is funny. If you ever noticed animals are not usually bright colors. Maybe birds, but never fish in the water."
3717,True! I suppose they were created to be neutral. So that they do not perceive each others as threats.
3717,"I noticed gold fish are usually spotted, but some are orange. I like sushi and most fish is light colored, and they add some salmon to brighten."
3717,"Fish definitely range in colors. I like sushi also, but I only have it about once per year. What do you do for fun?"
3717,"I like to fish for salmon, and it comes in handy since I like to eat fish."
3717,"That sounds fun! I wish I had the ability to do that, maybe I do. I just haven't tried. I enjoy watching sports on tv for fun."
3717,Some sporting good stores will give free fishing lessons with purchase of fishing gear.
3717,I have several sporting stores near me. I will have to check that out. Thank you for the tip!
3718,I was a slave for 10 years until I escaped.
3718,Once a slave?! I find that unbelievable in modern era.
3718,Yes I eventually escaped and became a carpenter. 
3718,I am sure you have stories to tell and I am very much interested.
3718,Yes I have lots of stories to tell it was so hard being a slave we worked most of the day and ate and drank very little.
3718,Where did this happen? Did you report to the authorities?
3718,It was in Russia and unfortunately the authorities do very little to help  
3718,What a country that is! So sad.
3718,Yeah some parts are ok but other are horrible.
3718,"Slavery is such a big issue, modern day slavery is even prominent."
3718,Yes it is you would of thought we wouldn't see things like that in this day and age but it is still a huge problem.
3718,We have to work collectively to put an end to this criminality!
3719,"I love roses the most, what about you?"
3719,I really love lilies. They are so beautiful.
3719,Yes they are. Do you work?
3719,I do. I am the receptionist for a primary care physician. How about you?
3719,i m a receptionist at a doctors office and also studying radiology at college.
3719,That's great! Radiology is a great field to get into right now. How long is your program?
3719,I have another 2 years left in my course to do.
3719,Hopefully the time goes by quickly. I want to start a program next year the the local community college.
3719,Yeah what are you looking to do?
3719,I am really interested in becoming a speech pathologist.
3719,Yeah that sounds a very interesting field.
3719,There seems to be quite a bit of opportunities for people with that degree.
3720,"That's great. I love Nevada, I grew up there."
3720,i've been to nevada many times . cool state . what do you enjoy ?
3720,I love to ski at Heavenly and go gamble in Reno
3720,awesome . i love the outdoors . gambling is fun if you have the money for it lol .
3720,Unfortunately I live in New Mexico now so I don't get to ski as much as I used to.
3720,"oh really, I have never been to new mexico before, Are you far from Nevada"
3720,"Yes, it is nearly an 18 hour drive to Reno from where I live. "
3720,That's a long drive. Do you visit Nevada often?
3720,I usually go once a year to visit family
3720,That's not bad. I only see people in my family once ever few years.
3720,Where does your family live? 
3720,My family is originally from Illinois
3721,Yes they did. So now I really want to dig them all up and plant something brand new.
3721,Oh my! Is it to late to plant more?
3721,I do not know to be honest. I need to research what can be planted this time of year.
3721,I believe some greens and herbs do well planted in the fall. 
3721,"Ok, thanks, I'll look into that. Herbs would be really cool."
3721,"I love gardening, it's one of my favorite things to do. Do you ever grow fruits and vegetables or mostly just flowers?"
3721,Mostly flowers. I don't need many fruits and vegetables and I hate having to give them away.
3721,That's understandable. Do you have other hobbies besides gardening?
3721,I like to listen to live music. Not really big concerts but like dive bars and such. How about you?
3722,I went with my kids - I have 5 - 3 boys and 2 girls - they loved it. 
3722,"Yes, that would be quite fun! My children will not go to haunted house they would be way to scared."
3722,how old are your kids?  I love scary but they are braver.  I'd rather sit and watch sports!
3722,4 and 10 my daughters are and my boy is 7
3723,"Yeah, IVe read on the subject, but I guess youre more informed about it than me lol!"
3723,"Haha. Well, who can judge art, right?"
3723,"Yes, art is very subjective."
3723,"I agree wholly, quite an impeccable spectrum. I read online on 4chan that da Vinci was likely an alien from the future."
3723,"Oh man, 4chanis full of weird theories. Was it at least a bit credible?"
3723,"i believe it was real . . . but who knows, really. Hahah  What are your hobbies? I ride bikes, too"
3723,Just watch cartoons and read. I like to go down to the beach every now and then.
3723,sounds like you have a nice life . i've not even ever seen a beach !
3723,Well not all beaches are nice lol! Its not much of a tourist attractions. There a no hotels around.
3723,that sounds nice though with no one around. I bet it is enjoyable!
3723,"Oh yes, and the restaurants are not overpriced!"
3723,There aren't many restaurants where I live. Only fast food.
3724,"Haha, I doubt those cakes tasted much better than the paper I sell!"
3724,I disagree. They were delicious! 
3724,"I'm just kidding with you, I am sure they were delicious. Do you have a favorite kind of cake? "
3724,My favorite is yellow cake with chocolate frosting. What How you?
3724,"Ooh, that's a good one. I like red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting. Or carrot cake. Or German chocolate cake. I think I like them all!"
3724,Carrot cake is wonderful! Do you enjoy cooking? 
3724,"I do, actually. One of my favorite hobbies is learning to cook foods from around the world. "
3724,Oh I think that is so neat. Have you discovered a favorite cuisine?
3724,"I love Indian food. There is so much depth in the flavors, and I enjoy the long process of slow cooking. What about you?"
3724,"I love Indian too and same, I so enjoy using a dutch oven to cook things slowly. But I really like making fresh pasta. I find it so rewarding."
3724,Is it difficult to make fresh pasta? I have always wanted to learn how. 
3724,It's not difficult. But it's very time consuming. There is a lot of repetitive motions. Have you always enjoyed cooking?
3725,"Yeah it is, it is funny how colours can bring out different things in us."
3725,"Wow you're right, it's fascinating to consider the study of hues and how they affect human behavior and other factors, also known as color psychology."
3725,Yeah it is amazing. Blue is my favorite colour.
3725,"me too. I love blue, red and black"
3725,Yeah cool. what do you do for work?
3725,Im a secretary at a non profit. How about you?
3725,Im a sales assistant for a wholesale company. 
3725,oh cool. What do you do exactly

3725,Is it salary or based on comission?
3725,Patrially yes I have a basic and can earn on top of that bonuses.
3725,Cool. What do you like to do for fun?
3726,I know it's here somewhere...
3726,Well I'm going to be busy playing video games so I can't really help you look for it
3726,what game are you playing?
3726,fortnite
3726,I used to play cfsii a lotg once upon a time.
3726,I love video games.
3726,how many do you play?
3726,"i don't even know , a lot"
3726,"I finally have a machine that is fast enough, and now I don't play. Heh."
3726,how is having epilepsy ? that would scare me .
3726,"It scares me, too."
3726,Are there certain video games you prefer to play to avoid symptoms of epilepsy?
3727,"I live in Oklahoma, like Southeast. I go to high school in a small town in the mountains."
3727,What's there to do in Oklahoma? Do you enjoy living there?
3727,"Beautiful country to take trips to many State Parks and Museums. We have several aquariums, one in Jenks with sharks."
3727,That's very good! Do you have good Mexican food restaurants? I love Mexican food.
3727,Oh... there are lots of Mexican restaurants as lots of mexicans (legal and illegal) live in Oklahoma. They cook good food. 
3727,Do you like Mexican style foods? I love tacos more than anything. 
3727," I like their sopapillias, sweet bread with cinnamon. I like sweets. I do like about any mexican food except not too hot."
3727,"I agree, too much spice ruins a dish. "
3727,My mother cooks mexican food very well. The High School has tacos and breakfast burritos.
3727,You're so lucky your high school had tacos; my high school cafeteria only served eggs and toast. 
3727,My mother cooks these delicious mexican cinnamon cookies or caramel flan.
3727,"I love cinnamon cookies, as well. What is your favourite dessert that your mom cooks?"
3727,"I am hungry, going to get me a breakfast burrito from McDonalds. Bye."
3728,"not yet, ive just started modeling with clay. I do mountain climbing way more than modeling."
3728,"that is very interesting! I am afraid to rock climb, myself."
3728,it takes some getting used to. as long as you follow all instructions its very safe!
3728,I need to work on fear first and then I will try it. What food do you like?
3728,"I really like italian and Hispanic food, preferably from Colombia. And you?"
3728,"Cool. I love italian. Real italian. Olive Garden does not count, hehe. I love hispanic food, however!"
3728,"Oh no, not olive garden! My wife is italian and she has lots of family recipes that are 100% authentic."
3728,that is awesome! I am very proud of her for keeping traditions!
3728,"So am I, they are some very tasty traditions lol! Which hispanic foods do you like?"
3728,"I am embarrassed to say, more so Tex Mex than actual authentic spanish food. I cannot handle spice very much these days, so well. "
3728,"Well that is why I mentioned Colombia, the food there is very low on spices but super delicious!"
3728,You are right thanks for reminding me!
3729,"I grew up around most of my big, extended family but now we are all over the place. I just recently came here to Vienna."
3729,"Wow! I've never been to Vienna, what's it like there?"
3729,It's gorgeous and the food here is absolutely delicious.
3729,"I'm a bit of a carnivore myself, what's the meat like there? Cheap? Delicious?"
3729,"I rarely eat meat, but I did have an amazing steak at a local steak house recently."
3729,What kind of food is good in Vienna?
3729,I have a sweet tooth so I can't say enough positive things about the sachertorte.
3729,"I'm sorry, I've never heard of that before. What is sachertorte?"
3729,It's a type of chocolate layered cake. I recommend a piece with coffee. Do you enjoy desserts?
3729,I do like desserts. Ice cream in particular. Ice cream and chocolate sponge cake is one of my favorites!
3729,I also enjoy a delicious ice cream or gelato. It can be very refreshing.
3729,What made you move to Vienna?
3730,"Oh wow, that's great.  Do you get to talk to people a lot at work?"
3730,"Yeah I do a bit when i'm, not to busy. Do you work?"
3730,I work as an actress.  I like being the center of attention.  haha
3730,Sounds like you have some real talent there. I bet you'll be famous one day and I will remember the day I chatted to you lol 
3730,"lol, I would love that!  Where did you grow up?  I was kind of all over, my parents abandoned me as a baby."
3730,"How did you end with your parents abandoning you? Thats so horrible, I grew up in Hereford England."
3730,"What do you mean how did I end? England sounds great, I've always wanted to visit there.  They have some great theaters."
3730,Yeah it ok here. I mean how come your parents abandoned you what happened? Did anyone tell you?
3730,"Well, I grew up in different orphanages, so it was pretty obvious they abandoned me.  Maybe they didn't like me stealing their spotlight! lol"
3730,Orphanages are okay in the UNited States. You usually get taken in by a family for a little while. It can be lonely.
3730,"Yeah, I didn't have any other family, but I'm doing okay.  I like when I'm noticed, so I guess it gives me a story to tell lol"
3730,you deserve to be noticed for what you have been through.
3731,She makes the best ham and cheese sandwiches.
3731,"Does she fry them? I love a fried ham and cheese sandwich. Tell her to make two, I am really hungry."
3731,She does and I love eating them when watching television in the evenings.
3731,What is your favorite show to watch? I have been watching old seasons of The Office lately.
3731,That is a good show but I really like Bob's Burgers.
3731,"I have only seen that a couple times, but I really liked it. Can you stream it online anywhere?"
3731,I think that Hulu is the only place that has it right now.
3731,"Cool, I'll check it out. Can I borrow your Hulu password? :)"
3731,Do you know who else wants to borrow my Hulu password?
3731,My mom? Lol
3731,"Hulu also has all of the Regular Show, which features this joke about a thousand times."
3731,NIce! Hulu has gotten a lot better in the past few years I think. It used to have a lot of boring shows. 
3732,I love doing it i'm really flexible from doing it
3732,"i bet. i wish i was more flexible, but at this age i just don't think it's going to happen anymore."
3732,No it does get harder as you get older.
3732,definitely. my daughter liked doing gymnastics when she was a little younger but then she stopped.
3732,Yeah why did she stop?
3732,she decided she wanted to do some other sports once she got to high school. she started doing tennis and seemed to love that more.
3732,Yeah is she still doing it?
3732,"she is. i don't know if she'll continue it when she goes off to college, though. i love her so much!"
3732,Yeah I know how you feel I love my kids too.
3732,families are so great. and it's fun to support our kids. how many kids do you have?
3732,"I have 3, 2 girls and a boy."
3732,"well, that must keep you busy! i always wanted a boy but just ended up with 2 girls myself. "
3733,Palace is a much more attractive sounding word than mansion. I think i'll take it!
3733,That's the spirit. Well congrats on your new mansion. Would you say this is your dream home?
3733,"Thank You. Absolutely! The thing i'm looking forward to most is entertaining and hosting things for family and friends with all of this space, put it to good use. "
3733,Sounds like fun. Time with family and friends are pricless. Do you have any children or a wife to enjoy this mansion with
3733,"Yes, I am married and we have a dog and two cats. No children yet. How about yourself?"
3733,"I have one son, not currently working married but working on it. One day however i will be able to have me a mansion just like you"
3733, I see. How old is your son? I'm happy to hear of your aspirations to have a mansion.
3733,"my son is 6 a but growing fast every day. Quick question, how long did it take you build your dream mansion home"
3733,"It's crazy how fast they grow isn't it? I swear, the older you get the faster the time goes. It took us 3 years to build. "
3733,Would you say your mansion has everything you dreamed of in a perfect home
3733,I would say it has everything I dreamed of and then some. More than I ever thought I could realistically have. 
3733,"Wow very inspiring, what will you advice others to do to reach the goal of building their own dream mansion"
3733,Follow your passion. Focus on helping people. Work 10X as hard as everyone else. 
3734,"Interesting, do you know the Italian word for a person that works at a coffee shop?"
3734,"bene . sorry , i love to speak italian"
3734,"that is neat, are you from Italy?"
3734,yes . originally born here . where are you from ?
3734,"I am origianlly from Finland, but have lived most of my life in the United States."
3734,"Oh, that sounds fun.  Where in the US do you live now?"
3734,"I live in Atlanta Georgia, I work as a secretary."
3734,"Oh, nice!  I just moved in with my boyfriend in NYC."
3734,"Have the leaves started changing color up there? They are just starting to change, I love colors, especially the shades of orange."
3734,"Yes, there are a lot of orange ones right now! There aren't a ton of foliage options in the city, but we take trips up north to look."
3734,"I would love to see that, do you just travel north to see the leaves? Or do you have friends that live there?"
3734,"Sometimes we stay with friends, other times we just go for the day.  I like to visit other starbucks on the way"
3735,"Yes, it is very relaxing! What are you going to do today?"
3735,"I must work some on a semi-truck, that is my job. But only a few hours then can relax the remainder of the day with my sweetheart, wife."
3735,Oh that sounds like a nice day for you. Especially nice to not have to work the entire day away. 
3735,"I use to be a truck driver, but retired from that job couple of years ago. What do you do for a job?"
3735,I work as a bank teller. It can be pretty boring but nice to talk to different people through the day. Is your wife also retired? 
3735," My wife works part-time as a nurse. I like married life, and I have more time to relax. Truck driving for a living is hard."
3735,"Oh that's good then that she is part-time. More time for you all. Yes, I would imagine truck driving would be hard as you are gone often."
3735,What do you do at your cabin? Do you fish? I like fishing and have time to do some fishing.
3735,"Yes, I fish often. I can't clean them though for cooking. "
3735,Do you get paid well as a bank teller? I miss the excellent money I made as a truck driver.
3735,"No, I wouldn't say it is excellent. There is more money in the management part. The extra time off would be nice though."
3735,"There is actually a big shortage in truck drivers in the USA. News on TV said around 50,000. If you want to change careers."
3736,I've never really experienced anything like it before. I felt so embarrassed so I couldn't even show up to sing.
3736,"Sounds pretty stressful. I think I know what you mean. Really, I spend most of my time at home playing video games, life is easier that way."
3736,"I like to stay home and read, but sometimes I feel like I am missing out on part of life because I'm so shy."
3736,"Yeah, I feel the same way. I love soccer, but I'm a bit too shy to join a team. I watch games on TV and play soccer video games."
3736,"If I can find enough courage, I want to see if I can explore cognitive behavioral therapy to help me move past my anxiety."
3736,Interesting. I wonder if therapy would help my situation?
3736,Everything I've read online indicates that it may help you work up the courage to interact with others.
3736,"Hmmm, maybe I'll have to look into that. Thank you! Communicating online for me is easy. It's face to face that can't do very well."
3736,"That is very relatable. Though, even online I find myself second guessing how I come across to others. "
3736,Very true. But it's much also much easier to hide when you're online. You don't have to face the shame of coming off badly and then being stuck there.
3736,"Oh, absolutely. It's easier to just walk away from the conversation without having to worry about seeing that person again!"
3736,I guess that's why I like playing online soccer games so much. I don't really have to meet the person but I can still interact with them.
3737,I'm quite nerdy so would love to be a great scientist. What about you?
3737,I would like to be a dancer for a music act like Taylor Swift or something.
3737,Yeah that would be cool do you do dance?
3737,I do dance. It is my favorite exercise. I would love to do it full time but would have to be paid.
3737,Yeah that would be great I love to exercise but i'm not much of a dancer though lol
3737,Do you enjoy music?
3737,Yes I love music my favourite is old school dance music. Hoiw about you?
3737,I like all music. I like pop when I am in the mood to dance and country when I want to sing.
3737,Yeah my partner loves country music and she used to dance to it.
3737,Country music seems to be getting better and adding more beats. Have you listened to Kane Brown's song?
3737,"No I haven't listened to it, is it good?"
3737,It is so good. It is a collab with Marshmallow. Have you heard of Marshmallow?
3738,I visit my brother by the ocean twice a year and we run on the beach.
3738,beaches are great places to run.  
3738,"Yeah, I like readin on the beach when I visit as well, mostly poetry and maybe some fantasy novels from time to time."
3738,"that sounds nice.  i'd need to bring one of those big umbrellas to block the sun or i'd fry, though."
3738,His wife actually has a side business renting those umbrellas. She works as librarian and I'll help her sorting books when were not on the beach.
3738,"Wow, she sounds like a busy woman! Does she get a lot of business or is it pretty empty usually?"
3738,Well its seasonal so she's pretty busy during the summer then it slows down as winter approaches.
3738,Does she work directly in the sun? Or like a small hut?  I'd just melt if I had to be in the sun more than half an hour.
3738,She has a small hut she works from and keeps a cooler full of bottled water as well.
3738,Do they live on the west coast or east coast?  I heard water gets pretty pricey out west.  
3738,"East coast, yeah I heard things out west in general can get pricey."
3738,"Nice, I like the east coast."
3739,I volunteer a lot and spend more time at home with my family. 
3739,What type of volunteer work do you do?
3739,I cook for a homeless shelter.
3739,Wow that is so nice. I bet you have some stories tell about your volunteer work?
3739,Yeah. I have seen a lot of things. They love my food though
3739,What type of food do you cook for them?
3739,My favorite food is pasta so I share my love of it with them
3739,"Yes I love Fettuccine Alfredo, what about you?"
3739,I love it too and it's an easy one to prepare
3739,Yes it is. What else do you do with your free time?
3739,I try to write but I seem to have a block lately
3739,Yes writers block if you are a writer is not good to have. 
3740,Are all people that caught poaching aware that they have trespassed on someone else's land?
3740,"I think that some don't really understand fully, like here in California there are people who say they did not realize they were poaching"
3740,"I am an avid hunter, and I am concerned sometimes that I may accidentally hunt on someone else's land, the boundaries are not always clearly marked."
3741,Its is a very strong car and price must be little bit high as i suspect.
3741,"It's between $28,300 and $56,800.  But it is worth it for a Chevy. What type of vehicles do you like?"
3741,"I use to love Diesel cars. Especially German diesels, like Mercedes-Benz diesel, they are very very reliable engines. "
3741,Oh okay. I hear they are cheap on parts too.
3741,Nos sure about the parts! But it has excellent fuel economy.
3741,Yes it has. They generate more more  from less fuel due to their higher compression rating.
3741,You are absolutely right! Btw What type of vehicles do you like?
3741,"I really like Chevy vehicles. They have diesels too, like the Chevy Colorado LT"
3741,I heard they use most Advanced Technology.
3741,"Yes, their advanced systems of control are very unique! Technology is taking over."
3741,The design is not my type! 
3741,Everyone has their likes and dislikes. It really is not an easy to maintain car either.
3742,Oh really? My oldest brother also loved to surf when we were kids.
3742,Yea he takes it out to the lake near my house. I want to go on it in a river.
3742,I bet that would be exciting! Any particular river?
3742,No. Maybe even the ocean. I love the fish.
3742,"Oh yes, the ocean! That is one thing I miss about home! I lived in Miami before I moved to the Midwest for college."
3742,It influenced me to build aquariums. Never been to Miami. I've been to Hollywood though.
3742,"Do you build aquariums for fun, or do you sell them?"
3742,i usually make the aquariums for local businesses .
3742,That is a very interesting profession; didn't think there would be a market for something like that. Do you also make custom ones for individual clients?
3742,Yes. I just made one for my brother in law who runs a major studio in Hollywood.
3742,So you are currently based on the West Coast. What is it like living there?
3742,Very warm & usually sunny. Where do you live
3743,How's that working for you?
3743,Well I'm a true believer so its not really a matter of it working out as what I know is waiting for me.
3743,I'm always afraid I'l get judged if I go to church
3743,I had the same worries then someone invited me and I went and found it to be non judgmental.
3743,You go to a church in your neighborhood?
3743,It's about 5 minutes away though I have thought about going to one just around the corner.
3743,That's cool.  What religion are you?
3743,"Christian, I just say Christian. It's less complicated that way."
3743,"Yeah, all sorts of denominations, that makes sense"
3743,"I love movies, have you seen anything good lately?"
3743,"I don't hit the theaters often, but I recently watched John Wick 3 and thought it was good.  You?"
3743,"I saw that when it hit theaters, I'm short at 5' 3"" so I had a hard time seeing the screen at times."
3744,That is neat. Do you do photography professionally?
3744,I do. I would love to have my photos in a music video
3744,I bet you could. I think sometimes you just have to know the right people.
3744,I wish I knew someone that knew Adam Levin
3744,Blake Shelton! lol...Yeah I wish I myself knew Adam Levin!
3744,Blake would work. Lol. 
3744,I wonder where he grew up. Or Adam? Lets find out and track them down.
3744,We might get in trouble for stalking
3744,"I know right, JK. So you take pics of places or people or what's your favorite?"
3744,People definitely. Candid photos of course
3744,Do you like catching funny moments? Those are my favorite.
3744,Sometimes. Those are the best photos
3745,"Yeah, like a charm!"
3745,That's amazing. They made things with quality back then! Cars are the same way. LOL.
3745,What was your first car?
3745,It was a black 1986 Camaro. Nothing terribly fancy but I loved that thing. 
3745,"That's pretty sweet. Mine was a '78 VW Camper Van. Lime green with a plaid interior. I loved it, but I didn't know how to work on the engine. "
3745,What a classic! I don't know how to work on engines either. Especially these days with all the computers. I just lease my cars now. 
3745,"I know what you mean. I learned how to work on cars eventually, but today's computers require an engineering degree to fix!"
3745,No kidding! And my degree isn't even remotely related to engineering. Sometimes I wish I could go back and learn more things.
3745,"You can! I try to take a class in something every year, just to keep new information circulating in my head. "
3745,That's a great idea to expand your knowledge like that. Maybe I will look into taking a class on something. Where do you take yours?
3745,"Different places. Coding class at the college, fly fishing lessons from an outfitter, cooking classes.."
3745,Ah; I see. That's really neat. I think I am going to make it a goal to learn something new. This sounds fun.
3746,"Yes, of course."
3746,Have you read any good books lately?
3746,"Not lately, I've been too busy."
3746,Busy with work? What kind of work do you do?
3746,"Yes, work is very busy.  I am a nurse and I am currently in school."
3746,"Oh wow, yes, then you are super busy! Do you like to cook?"
3746,"Sometimes, when I am in the mood."
3746,What are your favorite kinds of foods?
3746,"Pizza is my number one favorite.  Spagetti, hamburgers and my mother's Thanksgiving dinner are a close second."
3746,Nice! Some of my favorites as well. I love pizza!
3746,It's yummy and you don't even need a plate!
3746,So true! How about Mexican food? Are you a fan?
3747,I should go out to the lake today. 
3747,What do you like to do at the lake?
3747,I like to sit and read a good book. It's very peaceful when the kids are in school.
3747,Do you live near the lake? My family has a house at a nearby lake.
3747,"Yes, the lake is right down the road. Do you visit that house often?"
3747,"Yes, we go there a lot to ride in the boat, cookout, and just relax."
3747,Sounds nice. Sometimes I miss the city nightlife.
3747,"Not me, I am not a city person. I would prefer the peacefulness of a mountain trail."
3747,I've never done any serious hiking before. Do you like to hike?
3747,"Every chance I get, it's my most favorite activity."
3747,What's the longest hike you've ever done?
3747,"My longest in days is seven, in miles is 102."
3748,I'm super excited! This i the first time i've ever had a job where i've been given something like this!
3748,What do you plan to see or do in Paris while you are there?
3748,"I mostly want to go sight seeing, relax, and eat as much good food as I can find. "
3748,Are you going alone or is someone else going with you?
3749,Depends on what you mean by when you say like?
3749,I've heard good things about the Army and also how tough it is.
3749,Correct! The army requires a different breed of your other self. cause lifting yourself up isn't easy lol 
3749,"I considered the military when i was much younger , but it was not for me"
3749,So what do you do now dude?
3749,"nothing retired now but I like to excercise to try and keep active, you got to at my age."
3749, Am guessing your age is around early 50's or late 60's?
3749,"ah i am too old to remember haha , I'm 65 now but still going strong."
3749,Good good( Claps ) you keep on rockin old dude.
3749,Haha I appreciate you! How old are you?
3749,"28 about to be 29 soon, i cant wait for my army buddies to say that i am becoming an old man lol."
3749,lol what are you going to do after you leave the army?
3749,Probably work for USPS as a package handler. Anyway later dude
3750,But it is a way of expressing their self. They wanna show the people that they are beautiful
3750,That's true for some.  But some start their children so young!
3750,They doing it because they wanna start build confidence when young so it would be easy to join when they are adult
3750,"That's a good point!  I don't even have kids, I usually prefer dogs!"
3750,"I love dogs but i love kids too and i am not against about beauty pageant as long as with moderation, they don't wear whatever adult wearing during pageant."
3751,I had to get in my bathtub with my sofa cushions over me. I was so worried about everyone and their pets and all.
3751,My goodness! How scary! Was anyone hurt?
3751,It touched down at a warehouse and a few folks were hurt. Have you ever seen a tornado?
3751,Yes I have actually. It was scary.
3751,How did you stay safe?
3751,I just hid in an interior closet til it was over. My stomach was upset for days 
3751,Yeah like adrenaline stays in your system for a while after that. So what do you do to relax? 
3751,Stay at home and read or watch tv
3751,I wish I could be at home more. That sounds cozy.
3751,I know its crazy but most people relax with an alcoholic beverage but my favorite thing is sprite
3751,"I understand. I relax with coffee, caffeinated. Go figure, right?"
3751,I already have problems with being bloated so no caffeine for me.
3752,oh what did you study in college?
3752,Video games design. I want to either be a game tester or make my own games.
3752,that sounds awesome do you have a job now that is related to what you studied?
3752,"Well sort of, I'm a streamer on Twitch. I just hit 200,000 subscribers."
3752,that's amazing sounds way better than being apart of the 9-5 rat race
3752,It's so much fun. I'm getting paid to play video games I love and chat with people.
3752,that sounds pretty cool almost makes me want to go back to school 
3752,You should do it. It's actually helping me pay for college.
3752,yeah i don't think i've heard of twitch but i will definitely check it out 
3752,Even if you don't I would go back to school.
3752,i know it was just hard because i didn't really know what i wanted to do so i felt lost but i'm thinking about it
3752,Find what you love to do and see what you can study related to that. You'll soon find your passion like I did.
3753,that is so cool! I do not have one favorite. What type of food do you like?
3753,It usually depends on my mood but you can't go wrong with Mexican food. I also have a major sweet tooth.
3753,that is neat. my favorite are cupcakes
3753,I love cupcakes. We have one of those gourmet cupcake shops nearby. Their cupcakes are delicious.
3753,do you have any hobbies?
3753,I love to read. I also like playing board games. How about you?
3753,i love to play with dogs. they are my favorite animal and i spend alot of time with them. What games do you play?
3753,Dogs are the best. Nothing can make me smile faster. My current favorite game is Ticket to Ride. It's so much fun!
3753,thats great! i do not know that game. Did you live by an ocean?
3753,"Unfortunately, no. I'm about 7 hours away from the nearest beach. I love closer to mountains. How about you?"
3753,I live in a flat desolate place. I would LOVE to live by mountains! i am about 10 hours from an ocean. 
3753,Do you have to worry about tornadoes there? I am fascinated by weather.
3753,yes we have many 
3753,One of my close friends lives in Kansas. She sends me storm photos when she can.
3754,"Thanks for your support, I hope the bill is not too expensive. As a student I don't have much income."
3754,Will insurance cover it?
3754,"Only part of it, I still have to pay some out of pocket. Also my insurance does not cover the full cost of certain medications."
3754,I hope all goes well for you. Any plans this weekend?
3754,Actually I am planning on going fishing at a local lake. How about you?
3754,I have to catch up on some work. Do you catch and release or keep them?
3754,"Normally catch and release, if I catch something big and easy to clean I may take it home and cook it."
3754,Fresh fish is awesome. How do you prepare it? Fry or steam?
3754,"Sometimes I will fry it, I also like to grill it on wooden planks if the fillets are large enough."
3754,I've never had fish grilled on planks before. It sounds very tasty.
3754,"It certainly is, you should try it sometime. There are plenty of recipes online for it. What sort of work do you do?"
3754,I'm a concert promoter. It's a fun gig. The pay is nice.
3755,"Oh honey, I know exactly what you mean! My last one made me question my preferences, if you know what I mean, lol"
3755,So true. I've picked the wrong guy before.
3755,Are you seeing anyone now?
3755,"No, I'm single right now."
3755,Me too. After my last breakup I started traveling and stayed on the road for two years. I kind of like being alone now. 
3755,That is probably for the best and look at all you get to see that makes you happy.
3755,"So true! I learned that some places can only be appreciated alone, and some experiences just don't have room for two."
3755,I totally agree.  I really enjoy going to the casino's alone but I meet interesting people along the way.
3755,"I used to gamble quite a bit, but lately I have been donating most of my discretionary money to charity. "
3755,"Yes, donating is a good thing.  I probably should do more charity work."
3755,It is rewarding. I also maintain a stockpile and donate all the excess to charity. 
3755,That is important work. I've wasted more money than I care to admit.
3756,"I havent had a good afternoon off, what do you recommend i do"
3756,Maybe play some video games?
3756,i not really gamer but i do have a few errands to run. What about a good movie?
3756,There is a movie about video games called Ready Player One. Fair compromise.
3756,That was a great suggestion but im not really into gaming movies. Maybe ill grab lunch
3756,You can't go wrong with lunch. On my lunch break I brainstorm startup ideas for my own video games. What are you interested in?
3756,I think im going to go for pizza for lunch. What do you think I should try for lunch
3756, Just go for pizza. I'm going to take a late lunch myself as I am working on the design team for a video game.
3756,"Well since i have the afternoon off, i think ill grab a early movie and head to lunch after that"
3756,Sounds good. I hope you have a great afternoon and lunch.
3756,"Thank you, what do you plan to eat for lunch"
3756,"I plan to have an egg sandwich with brown mustard, lettuce, and onion on toasted bread."
3756,"Sounds healthy, well enjoy your afternoon friend. Headed out to enjoy my fun afternoon"
3757,Sounds interesting. Funny I have read Asimov and Heinlein but not Herbert.
3757,"I haven't read that one, but I do love a good science fiction book."
3757,Do you also like SF movies? 
3757,I do.   Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social issues.
3757,"Yes, the only genre in which it's acceptable to have an overt moral. Would you travel to space if you could?"
3757,I'd love to travel to space! I'm quite an introvert and like being alone. I even hate talking on the phone.
3757,"I am an introvert, too. Funny how talking on the phone seems like such a big deal!"
3757,I know. Let me text or email!!
3757,"Exactly. Or preferably, just leave me alone! :D"
3757,I hear that! My mom is always calling me to see if I can help her with my Grandma though...
3757,"Well, it's different with family. Is your grandma sick?"
3757,She just can't take care of herself anymore so my Mom does. It is a lot of work though.
3758,"Thanks for the words of encouragement, I'm hoping I can find a workplace real soon."
3758,"It takes time to get used to a new place and know where to get work, you'll be fine"
3758,"That's true, shouldn't be too hard to get a job. I am a janitor by trade."
3758,That's like the toughest job out there.
3758,I feel it is underpaid as well.
3758,"many dont want to do certain jobs and won't pay properly for those that will, it can be hard. there's always work available though"
3758,"Enough about work for now, what are your plans for the weekend? I want to do something outdoors."
3758,i've no plans . today is a rest day for me . try and get ready for next week
3758,What is it that you do for work?
3758,"I'm mostly in construction right now, plant fitter by trade, can be tough in winter but i like it"
3758,"I'm a little jealous. I would love a job where I get to work outdoors, unfortunately most janitorial work is inside."
3758,"that is tough , now appreciate my outside job a little more"
3759,"Thank you, it took a lot of work to get here. I've had a really hard time and I want to achieve my dreams"
3759,"Putting in hard work is how you achieve your dreams. Unfortunately, I still live at home. I'll achieve my dreams one day."
3759,To achieve your dreams you have to put yourself out there! What do you want to do?
3759,"That is inspirational. Well, I am bisexual so I want to get involved in those kind of social issues. Hopefully something that pays."
3759,"If you are willing, I'd love to practice my photography on you! I would be able to put your activism out there while promoting my dream of photography!"
3759,I think we would make a great team. We would both be able to achieve our dreams. Maybe once I move out of my parents home.
3759,Maybe you could talk to your parents and discuss moving out. They probably would support it because they love you.
3759,"I think they would support me, they are very loving. When I told them I'm bisexual it was very matter of fact and casual. They didn't mind."
3759,That's wonderful. My late husband was bisexual but it was much harder for him when he came out. I'm glad your family is supportive.
3759,I am sad to hear that it was so hard for him. How long have you been a photographer?
3759,"Around three years, but I really want to be professional. That's my lifelong dream."
3759,I think that with practice you will get their. I didn't realize photography is much more than taking a picture. It's complicated really.
3760,I like pizza but I eat all kinds and varieties because I do not like eating one thing too much.
3760,I love pizza. I just recently started eating as a vegetarian so I do miss the pepperoni.
3760,"Definitely. Might I suggest using a zesty or smokey sauce, even barbeque sauce."
3760,"That sounds really delicious, I'll have to try it sometime."
3760,Sure and you might not miss the pepperoni as much. I like onion and mushroom with barbeque sauce. 
3760,"I try to put onions on just about everything, garlic as well."
3760,I think those are both really good for you. Cheap too lol. I'm trying to save for my own place
3760,Are your parents pushing you out or are they OK with you living at home until you find a place?
3760,They are ok with it as long as I am going to school and I am right now. I'm jealous of my friends on their own.
3760,Well that's good. I was jealous as well until I had my own place. It will certainly change your life for the better.
3760,I do think I will miss my mom but she will be fine she has tons of friends.
3760,Do you plan on moving far away. My parents live about 10 miles from me and my mom says it feels like 100.
3761,Wow.  How do you know that?
3761,"I am an insatiable reader, my head is full of useless facts, lol"
3761,"That's really cool.  I just love to sing, and wouldn't eve think of that, so thank you"
3761,"I wish I could sing better. When I do karaoke, I always enjoy it way more than the audience!"
3761,Maybe after a few cocktails?   LOL
3761,ONLY after a few cocktails! 
3761,hahahaha!  I resemble that comment!
3761,"What is your go-to drink for karaoke? Mine is tequila and ginger ale. The ginger keeps the throat wet, and the tequila gives the courage. "
3761,"That sounds deleicious.  Tequila is the great motivator, huh?  I just turned 21 and got super drunk drinking it "
3761,"Be careful with cheap tequila though, the hangover is awful!"
3761,I think I might still be hungover from cheap tequila on my birthday as a matter of fact  :)
3761,Oh no! How long ago was your birthday? 
3761,two weeks ago  haha
3762,Lol kids are little monsters sometimes aren't they?
3762,"They can be, I guess!  Do you have any kids?"
3762,Young ones between the age 5 and 3.
3762,"That's a fun age!  I only have one.  It would be hard for us to have more, with no help and my family living across the country."
3762,Gods blessing my friend. It helps to push through when things become difficult 
3762,"So true.  I guess you know what you're in for with that many kids, though!"
3762,Yep lol fun times with the little ones trying to prank the other out of boredem 
3762,I bet they can come up with all kinds of games and things to do!  Their family will have enough people to make their own sports teams.
3762,Hopefully martial arts will be important for their growth when my they become of age.
3762,"Yes, I've heard that's great for kids.  Do you play any sports?"
3762,Mostly tennis and sometimes boxing class'es with some friends of mine lol. and you?
3762,"My friends started an adult softball league I've been playing in.  We occasionally play basketball, too."
3763,It's next Saturday. The whole class will attend.
3763,"I bet she will really enjoy that, if she likes surprises. Did you order a cake?"
3763,Well she isn't my real wife. I'm in preschool so I don't have money to buy anything.
3763,Maybe you could draw her a picture of a birthday cake with candles.
3763,Oh good idea. I don't know how old she is. How can I ask her without giving away the surprise?
3763,You could play a game and you decide who gets to go first on age. 
3763,You're really smart. I like your ideas. I should go read my book.
3763,Thank you. I have a little girl of my own so that's how I know so much about them.
3763,Do you think a pink hairpin is a good present?
3763,I bet she would love that. My little girl would.
3763,I'm glad. It's raining today.
3763,Sometimes a rainy day is nice and it can even be fun.
3764,"Oh, that must has been hard. I like good music."
3764,IT wasn't the greatest music but all our friends were there
3764,That is good. Will working 3 jobs I have loads of friends and we go out all the time.
3764,I want my job to be a party
3764,That would be fun but not very practical.  Maybe we should make a company that is a party.
3764,That's a good idea
3764,We could be Party's are Us?
3764,I like the idea
3764,Do you walk for fun?  I walk a bunch.
3764,I ride my scooter
3764,That must be fun.  I need to get a scooter to get to all my jobs.  Gas is expensive for my car.
3764,Yeah gas is expensive
3765,I met my cousin! Yes It was individual
3765,Interesting. According to my friends I'm a bit neurotic when it comes to my hypochondriasis but I don't really think so.
3765,Hypochondriasis is a persistent fear of having a serious medical illness. Is that right?
3765,Yes. Does your cousin complain to you often about having illnesses that he/she doesn't actually have?
3765,Yes! Very much! It is one type of illness.
3765,"Oh, just one type? Interesting. I seem to have a different illness every week. It's really annoying. Plus I am OCD that makes it tough to deal with."
3765,Oh! very sad! What is the most annoying for you?
3765,I think the OCD because it interferes with dealing with my other illnesses and makes it hard to get well.
3765,Oh! I hope you will get well soon.
3765,Thank you. I am going to try. I hope you have some fun weekend plans.
3765,Not Really! Getting bored in home.
3765,Same here. I try not to go out much because I don't want to get sick. So I watch a lot of TV. Maybe you can find a movie.
3766,"i don't really like hockey at all. i cook for my boyfriend when he watches it, though."
3766,Yeah Thats cool. You are being part for the moment. LOL
3766,i don't think i know that expression.  what does it mean?
3766,"Oh, sorry . Its just a smile expression."
3766,"not a problem.  so, i take it that you like hockey?  have you ever played?"
3766,Yeah I love hockey. I have played Ice hockey on the street because I don't know how to skate
3767,That sounds interesting but for my first cruise i would like into any port to explore the culture of the land
3767,"I agree, however I find it pleasant to simply travel with no destination in mind. Where would your ideal first port be?"
3767,My partner is orginally from jamacia so i would like ideally port into Montego Bay for my first port to explore  the land and culture with her
3768,"I can tolerate them, I guess, the little rascals."
3768,Right now I'm so focused on my paintings that I just don't have time.
3768,"Artist, eh?"
3768,"Yep, mostly with watercolors. I paint a lot of ocean and water scenes. I love blue!"
3768,Do you live near the ocean?
3768,About 3 hours away but I have a small river near me.
3768,"Ah, I love rivers, fly fishing and all that."
3768,My father fly fishes. I usually use just some live bait and have a beer while fishing.
3768,"Ah, yes...beer!"
3768,Fishing is one of the few things you can fail at and still have a great time doing it!
3768,Isn't that the truth.
3768,What's the biggest fish you ever caught?
3768,21 inch brown trout.
3769,I was 5 years old and in Kindergarten. It was sweet LOL!
3769,Me too! it happened right in front of the class.
3769,"That's hilarious! Mine was out at recess, so not as embarrassing as yours."
3769,"Well being in kindergarten it didn't matter, I didn't know what I was doing. lol."
3769,"It's funny that I remember that kiss fondly, but I just don't believe in love anymore."
3769,Well that's sad that you don't believe in love anymore. Obviously you just haven't found the right person.
3769,That 5 year old was the best of the lot! Now I just go drinking and dancing with friends. How about you?
3769,"I enjoy spending my free time outdoors, I love to hike and backpack."
3769,"That sounds fun too. But I don't drink in the daytime, it's too dehydrating."
3769,"Hiking and drinking don't mix too well, but after the hike sitting around the campfire is another story."
3769,Ha! Now I'm picturing you with a beer while roasting marshmallows on the camp fire.
3769,"That's me, sitting under the stars enjoying life."
3769,Sounds fun! I hope we can chat again later.
3770,She was! I got an uber though so wasn't the end of the world
3770,Some friend! But at least Uber runs in your area. Not so much in mine--I'd need to call a cab.
3770,"YE i never realised how regoinal uber was, I thought about driving for them once but needed a newer car. what do you do for work?"
3770,"I am a barista, and I do a few side gigs, but mainly I go to school, which is priority right now. How about you?"
3770,"I've got four girls to look after so that keeps me busy but I also have some students I teach music to, helps with the bills"
3770,"Cool! I love music and I am not too picky about what kid, though not too find of country or jazz. Do you teach piano?"
3770,"I wish I'd learnt piano! too big to carry around though, the guitar was easier for that when I was learning"
3770,I love guitar music. Do you ever perform in public?
3770,"we do small gigs sometimes, maybe make some money for a local cause or school but i get really nervous"
3770,I understand the nerves! I am kind of an introvert so that would not be for me. But I'll bet it's fun.
3770,It is rewarding but I think I prefer the one on one teaching. how is it in the coffee shop?
3770,The coffee shop is great. The tips are good and I love making all the different coffee drinks.
3771,How did you learn to sew?
3771,I learned from my grandma
3771,That's lovely. It will hopefully always remind you of that special time with her when you sew. 
3771,It was precious time
3771,"My grandma quilted by hand. Even though I can't sew, having two of the quilts she made has meant so much to me."
3771,My mom learned from my grandma
3771,"That's an incredible legacy. My mom can sew a little, but I think she was self taught."
3771,That's nice I enjoy sewing
3771,I like to listen to music and read. It's very relaxing.
3771,I love the beatles
3771,They are great! I like to listen to their anthology sometimes. Or their station on Pandora.
3771,I still lidten to them everyday
3772,"It was really windy, cold, and dark out.  Have you ever had a time where you were scared?"
3772,"Yes, a few years back I went exploring a cave and got stuck while trying to squeeze through a small opening. I thought I would never get out!"
3772,That would freak me out since I am a bit claustrophobic.  How did you get out?
3772,"After struggling for a bit, it started raining outside and water started trickling in. Thankfully it made the rocks and dirt slick enough that I was able to slip out."
3772,Well that might be the one case you enjoy seeing the rain come.  No rain here today but next week it is suppose to snow!!
3772,"It looks like rain here today- I hope not too much, I have plans to visit a roftop patio for drinks later!"
3772,That sounds like fun hopefully it will be nice by then.  It is sunny here and I will be on the golf course in less than 2 hours
3772,"As a person working part time in the campus library, I could never afford playing golf. Maybe one day. Are you any good?"
3772,I used to be really good but now I just enjoy playing it.  How do you like working in the campus library?
3772,"It's pretty fun. The pay isn't great, but it keeps me busy. Decent work for now."
3772,Are you a student at the school as well?
3772,"Yes, I have work-study which I obtained through my FAFSA application. The government pretends it's financial aid, but I think that if I'm working, it's not aid."
3773,"Oh wow, I didn't know that!  I just started trying different kinds of sushi recently."
3773,That's good to share the joy of sushi with your partner. There are a lot of cool sushi restaurants near me.
3773,Oh that's cool.  There aren't many near where we live.  We usually drive an hour to this sushi restaurant.
3773,Bummer. But maybe you guys could make it yourselves. Do you have a nice kitchen?
3773,"Our kitchen is still a work in progress.  I am a carpenter, so I have been working on it myself, but it's hard to find the time!"
3773,I bet that is tough. I wish things were more old fashioned sometimes and neighbors helped others with projects you know?
3773,"Yes, that would be nice.  I'm such a perfectionist it may be hard to give over the control, but it would be great to have it done!"
3773,I have learned that to be honest. If people want to help you just get that stuff done!
3773,Definitely something to think about.  What do you do?
3773,I am a caregiver. I help mostly elderly people. What they like most is my dog Hank.
3773,"Oh, that's wonderful.  What kind of dog is Hank?"
3773,He is a lab. Do you have pets.
3774,I was born in London and my dad didn't help at all. I think I could help out more.
3774,Does your wife work? I mean I work in a doctors office and I find little time to do the things I like to do.
3774,"No, she's retired too.  She loves the housework so I just stay out of her way."
3774,You should just pour her a glass of wine one day and get her a good book and tell her to relax
3774,That sounds good for both of us.
3774,Yes. I love to read myself. Tell her to just take a break.
3774,Could be harder than it sounds. She's a work-a-holic.
3774,Don't take no for an answer. Lol
3774,Okay.  I'll take you advise.  A day of pampering is coming up.  Then maybe she'll feel like sharing her chores with me.
3774,Or just wish her away on some romantic vacation. 
3774,Hmmm. That sounds good too.  We haven't been over seas in a while.  We could go home to London for a visit.
3774,Sounds like a plan
3775,Do you like reading?
3775,"I enjoy reading occasionally, my favorite genre is romance"
3775,"That's so cool. I like romance too, but I spend more reading on motivational stories and autobiographies."
3775,"that sounds super interesting, why are motivational stories your favorite"
3775,"Because it gives inspiration to my life, and I learnt that every good things take time. "
3775,"that is really cool, maybe i will pick up a motivational book soon, we all need a little extra pep."
3775,I am glad to know that. I have great opportunities to read all genres because I work at a library. 
3775,"wow! Working at a library sounds like an important job, you are keeping millions of worlds in one building"
3775,"Of course, yeah. I love reading and I am blessed hat I work in a place where I don't feel like working.  "
3775,there is that saying do what you love and you will never work a day
3775,Yeah. We can make our own movies while reading books. I wanna direct a movie in future.
3775,"It would be amazing to be able to direct your own movie, i hope you reach that goal some day"
3775,Yeah. I hope so. Thank you
3776,"I hope you enjoy culinary school. Just so you know, I actually emigrated to America when I was five years of age."
3776,"Wow, that's exciting.  Where did you emigrate from?"
3776,"I emigrated from Havana, Cuba. I came with both my parents and my brother who now plays in a metal band and travels the world."
3776,That's cool that your brother is able to travel the world.  I have a hard time travelling since I'm pretty scared of open spaces.
3776,"Interesting. I wonder, is this a result of you having anxiety from having too much space around you? "
3776,I think it might be.  It's something that I'm working on in therapy though so hopefully it gets better for me.
3776,"I hope you can overcome your fear someday. My brother has similar issues, but he says traveling has helped him cope with his anxiety around people."
3776,That's great to hear.  Hopefully after a bit more therapy I might be ready to give travel a try.
3776,"I hope all goes well. When my family first moved to America, traveling and getting to know the state of Florida helped to cope with big changes."
3776,Florida sounds beautiful from what I've heard.  What's your favorite thing to do in the state?
3776,I enjoy going to the beach and different music festivals. My brother and his metal band will come down to perform in November. 
3776,That sounds great!  Is your brother touring for most of the year then?
3777,That's cool
3777,do you wear eyeglasses or contact lenses
3777,I don't were either my eyesight is perfect
3777,i hate having to wear my glasses. Contacts make my day much easier
3777,They probably do. you can do more things 
3777,I am constantly misplacing my glasses. Sunglasses too
3777,I always lose my sun glasses
3777,That is why I never buy an expensive pair of sunglasses
3777,Same i pay no more than $10 a pair
3777,me too. I wish my contacts and glasses were that inexpensive
3777,Yeah I've heard they can be expensive
3777,Insurance pays a little but not much
3778,It really is. I have to wear glasses to read and dive. 
3778," I get alergic to a few things so my eyes are a bit too sensitive for contacts all the time, i like them for walking and being outdoors"
3778,My ex wife wore contacts a lot. We just recently got divorced. It was for the better.
3778,"ouch, thats a tough time"
3778,Yea it was not a healthy relationship. She was having 3 affairs.
3778,"must have been a tough time, do youhave other family?"
3778,Yea my parents and grandparents live close by. 
3778,"thats good, I don't see my family much, just the dog!"
3778,Aww that's terrible. 
3778,"its ok, partly my choice and partly theirs, I'm looking for wokr at the moment so more focused on that, bils to pay!"
3778,I understand how that goes. I just about payed off all of my debt.
3778,ye the debts don't get smaller very quick do they? 10 years for 1k I heard
3779,"absolutely, I am thinking about getting a person to clean the house"
3779,That sounds amazing. I would love to do that too but my house is so messy I'd want to pre-clean before they even came over.
3779,"I guess so, my house is not too bad shape, so I am ready for some help"
3779,I should probably look into that. Then I could focus more on spending time with the kids.
3779,"Me too, then I will have more time to help my kids with homeworks"
3779,Work has been so challenging for me lately. I'm glad my partner is able to help the kids with homework and dinner.
3779,"My partner and I both do cooking also, I am also working from home part-time"
3779,I've been working about 60 hours a week these days. It's making taking care of things at home so difficult.
3779,"You definitely need to get outside help, otherwise you'll go into burnout!"
3779,I'm starting to think you may be right. Maybe you can send me the name of the housecleaner if you like them.
3779,"I guess we do not live in the same city or country even! I know, good housekeepers are hard to find"
3779,"Oh, that's true. I'm just wondering if your cleaner is part of a national chain. Then a recommendation would be good."
3780,"Yes, I'm glad he did that. I spent the afternoon baking them a cake."
3780,"How sweet of you! I don't get much ""me time"" either. I actually volunteer with animals to get some without people time. LOL."
3780,That is a great idea. I like dogs but my husband is allergic to them. How many hours do you volunteer?
3780,Just a few every other week. I walk dogs and spend time with cats at the animal shelter. It's kind of therapeutic.
3780,How difficult is it to become a volunteer? Is it a long process?
3780,No; it was super easy. They are always looking for help. You just fill out a short information form and they take just about anyone.
3780,I think I'll drop by the animal shelter next week to sign up. Have you ever adopted any of them?
3780,"I've been tempted so many times, but we already have a dog and a cat at home and my husband doesn't want any more."
3780,I had a cat when I was little. She like my brothers better than me.
3780,"My cat likes my husband better, too. Cats are weird like that. LOL."
3780,Do you have any children? My daugher starts middle school next month.
3780,"I have a daughter, too. She will start at elementary school soon but I'm worried about the schools here in Pittsburgh."
3781,Once I open my Juice Bar here in Mexico you will have to come try it!  
3781,Sounds like a great idea! 
3781,I have heard it is cheaper to build there and the waves on the coast are great
3781,I would love to live on the coast
3781,Me too.  It seems like to would be a more relaxing lifestyle
3782,"nice, who's your favorite hero that you watch? "
3782,"it depends the superhero , some of them are just overplayed"
3782,i agree.  i like the newer shows with a ton of action like agents of shield.  i don't like the dc shows too much.
3782,Do you watch Game of Thrones at all? I'm a fan of the show. I'm bummed there won't be more season's
3782,oh yeah.  and how about that ending.  so terrible.  who was your favorite character? 
3782,Jon Snow but I also loved Daenarys but the story arcs are what keep me captivated.
3782,"yeah, they were both great.  i totally didn't see that they would end up together or that they'd be related!"
3783,I had my mother gone a lot when I was a child as well.
3783,yea of course . that is good to think positive
3783,My mom had to work so it was the way it was.
3783,My Mom had to work too. I enjoyed eating Ravioli and Hormel Chili until she got home!
3783,"Lol, it was great for me because she always left the freezer stocked with frozen pizzas for me."
3783,"Oh yeah, that sounds yum! Now Mom is retired and she has to put up with me watching The Walking Dead every Sunday night."
3783,"Oh, I watch that show also, but sadly my mom has passed."
3783,"I'm sorry your Mom has passed. She's watching over you, though, I'm sure."
3783,"Thank you, I believe she is waiting for me to show up where she is at."
3783,"That's a great way to look at it. I believe that, too. Hey, I'm really thin in spite of the Ravioli and frozen pizzas. How about you?"
3783,I'm thin but I eat really healthy these days. I'm into fitness and a healthy lifestyle.
3783,"I know some people that eat healthy, but still struggle with their weight. So, that's great you don't!"
3784," I like salmon and crab, never had fish steaks. Don't eat pork anymore lol"
3784,"I'm allergic to seafood, fish is the only thing safe to eat for me. So it's pretty much steak and pork for me."
3784,My daughter is too. I have to be up at 4am every day but I was up half the night watching scary movies lol
3784,"What movie? I can't watch scary movies anymore since having kids, they are too realistic now haha"
3784,Yeah they've started getting better. I was watching Hereditary which is AWESOME! Highly recommend.
3784,"I'll have to see that then, thanks for the recommend. "
3784,Oh no problem. Have you started Thanksgiving dinner shopping yet? I get a jump on it pretty early.
3784,"No, not yet but I'm getting ready to start. I like having everything early also. "
3784,"Well I hope you enjoy your holidays. It was nice talking with you, have a great day!"
3784,You too! Thanks!
3784,Oh and don't forget to check out the movie. Toni Collette deserves an Oscar
3784,"Sure will, Thanks. I can't wait till winter to curl up with a cup of hot chocolate and watch movies."
3785,What type of construction work?
3785,i do general contract work
3785,Really. I'm getting married in a few months and could use someone to build an arch for us to stand under.  Can you help?
3785,"it depends on the location, and my availablity, but we can try to make something work"
3785,That would be great. I know you live close to me and you have kids.  Maybe we could trade my babysitting skills for your construction skills.
3785,Lol. sounds like a deal to me
3785,It's going to be an awesome wedding. We already sent you an invite.
3785,That's awesome! I wish you all the best on your upcoming nuptials!
3785,Thank you so much!  It will be out of doors of course so we both have to watch out for the freckles! Lol
3785,LOL! I hear that :)
3785,I hope the sun shines on us and not the rain.
3785,I hope so to! Fingers crossed for sure!
3786,are there a lot where you live? they are usually so far away from me.
3786,Yes there's a lot of shows around here
3786,that's great. i'm saving up right now to go to a big one in tennessee.
3786,I want horses someday
3786,they are so much work. i like to ride them but taking care of them is like a job in itself.
3786,What type of horse do yu want
3786,i've always wanted a black horse like black beauty.
3786,I want a quarter horse
3786,they are great horses. my friend has one and it is so smart.
3786,Does she race horse?
3786,she does barrel racing.
3786,I want to learn
3787,Wow that is a lot of fish. Wheres you favorite place to fish?
3787,It's definitely the quickest way to turn a profit from it. Otherwise I like to fish from my boat with a rod and reel.
3787,Cool. I love fishing as a well. I have been all over the world fishing.
3787,"Do you prefer fishing in the ocean, river, or lake?"
3787,I like lakes the best.
3787,I find that to be the most peaceful way to fish.
3787,Yea me 2. I love to pack an lunch and my brownies and just relax.
3787,"As I've gotten older, I prefer to just fish alone or with my dog."
3787,Nice I wish I had a dog. I just don't have time to take care of it. I'm always away from home.
3787,That's the only downside. I travel less now unless I can take him with me. I can't just up and go these days.
3787,That is true. Do you have any family that the dog could stay with?
3787,"No, we don't have any family in the area."
3788,"I redid my kitchen and bathroom, and repainted my bedroom. "
3788,Did you did the work on your own or hire contractors?
3788,"I work in public relations so I have contacts, I was able to find someone easily. Are you a vegan?"
3788,"No, I'm a meat eater. LOL."
3788,"I went vegan about three years ago, I still love meat though lol so I eat substitutes"
3788,How is vegan different than vegetarian?
3788,"With veganism you don't eat any animal products, including butter, milk, eggs etc."
3788,It seems like it could take a lot of discipline to stay on track. Do you find it hard?
3788,At first I did but it got easier. What's your favorite food? Mine is spaghetti I just use vegan meat crumbles.
3788,I love all types of pasta. What are vegan meat crumbles made of?
3788,It's like some sort of vegetable product they use. You can't tell the difference lol
3788,"Hmm, sounds interesting. I might try them. Can you easily find them at grocery stores?"
3788,Yes in the healthy section. Well it was nice chatting with you have a great day!
3789,I guess that's true.  I'd probably have to do a bit more research on the different sounds.  Read up on it.
3789,"Oh definitely, noise levels are a big deal. There are also quite a few different designs, like some are better for long distance and some are better for commuting."
3789,I didn't know there was so much to know on the types of motorcycles there are.  How do you know so much?
3789,"Honestly I don't know much about them, except my friend told me they're key to having good engine balance, which is an engine that doesn't produce much vibration"
3789,Would you recommend getting a motorcycle instead of a car?
3789,"If you know how to ride them, But a car may be a safer version. I do if you have good balance and can ride a motorcycle"
3789,"I guess that would be something to look into.  I'd have to overcome my fear, first, and of course, the sound."
3789,yes you definitely dont want to be afraid  and the noise is loud.
3789,I wonder if people who drive motorcycles wear earplugs or not?
3789,I really dont know. I wonder too. That would be a good idea.
3789,"Thinking about it, I'd probably be to afraid to ride one without sound anyway.  Oh well, it was a good idea while it lasted."
3789,Yes that would probably not be a good idea. You need to hear what is going on around you. Yes it was good idea while it lasted.
3790,"He was up on the ledge where I leave my outside cat's food bowl, and chowing down!"
3790,"Awwww, he was just hungry. <3 I do hear that possums eat a lot of ticks, so probably good to have around."
3790,"Ew, gross! LOL! I'm in college and I never learned that in school. You're so smart!"
3790,What is your major? You must be smart too if you are in college.
3790,"Social work. I love learning new things, so I'm filing the tick / possum away in my vault. HOw about you?"
3790,"I have three jobs, LOL. I am a barista, a salesperson at a boutique, and a part-time receptionist in a physical therapy office. Social work is cool. "
3790,"Wow, you're a really hard worker! I enjoy working out, but the jobs you're doing are a workout on their own!"
3790,"Well, ya gotta eat. What kid of workout do you like? Cardio? Weights?"
3790,"I do both, unless I can find someone to play tennis or volleyball with. It's much more fun to play a sport than just work out for me."
3790,"Yes, sports are competitive and social. Are you a competitive person?"
3790,"Yes, I admit it. I'm competitive! I like to win, but I'm a good loser as well. I believe in winning fair and square."
3790,"That's good. I am competitive, too, and I love board games!"
3791,What is your favorite color?
3791,"I love turquoise, it's so calming. I bought a turquoise Chevy Tahoe not too long ago"
3791,Oh good choice! I am going to buy a car soon! may be in xmas!
3791,Do it! Give yourself a merry Christmas lol. What's your favorite food? Mine is spaghetti
3791,"I like Pizza! Hawai pizza you know with pineapple, but some people hate it haha"
3791,Oh I lOVE pineapple on pizza! People who don't just have immature taste buds lol
3791,"yes, I am agree with you!"
3791,You got any plans for Halloween?
3791,"well just visit my grand parents, and give candy for children, what about you?"
3791,I might take my kids to a trunk or treat event. Ever been to one of those?
3791,"No, never! but that sound really funny!"
3791,They want to dress up as the Tethers from the movie Us lol
3792,Really. What is that defining characteristic?
3792,The defining characteristic is that the product is one of the major characteristics of a mammal. 
3792,So all mammals have hair.  It is different colors and some colors are brighter than others.
3792,"Oh, well I guess I was wrong! :("
3792,I really want to dye my hair but I live at home with my parents.
3792,"You should die it, if your heart desires to. Your parents should be okay with it. Do you think your parents will be okay with your decision?"
3792,They might be okay with it but I work too.  I need to buy a car so I have to work.
3792,"You can prioritize your spending, and focus on what your goals are. Start saving now!"
3792,So I guess the hair color will have to wait.
3792,"Yes, if its not within your budget, or you will need to look at other cost - cutting measures. "
3792,The cost of a salon these days is ridiculous.  I want something bright and colorful. But it will have to wait. 
3792,"You seem like you have your priorities straight, and have a goal in mind. "
3793,I am 5feet but I have full beard which is so thick. I love my beard. lol 
3793,That is awesome. I wish I had a full beard. I have four siblings and only one of them has a nice full beard. 
3793,Wow that's  great i have 8 brothers and we are very friendly
3793,Wow that's a lot of siblings. I am actually the oldest of my siblings and have had the most responsibility. 
3793,That's really nice .because it's help you in your future.. 
3793,"I definitely agree. I feel like since I have four other siblings, the level of competition is really high. It must have been the same for you."
3793,yeah same here also but it's really funny.I am the youngest of my siblings so we had lots fun 
3793,"That's great. I wish I had as much fun. As the oldest, I had to work around the house and set an example for my other four siblings."
3793,Even my bother also doing the same thing . Some time I help my brother for his work
3793,That's always good to help. I tend to always help my four siblings especially when it comes to choosing the right career path.
3793,Yeah if someone is there like you it will help them for choosing right path.when they get into a right path you will feel relaxed 
3793,"Correct. As the oldest, I did not want my other four siblings feeling like they were in my shadow. Did you ever feel like you were in the shadow?"
3794,"when i was younger, i would travel all over to hike, but now i just hike near home. i live in alabama."
3794,Arizona also has great place to hike. Just don't hike in the heat
3794,"i hear you. it gets hot here, too. i would love to go to arizona some day. when is the best time for weather?"
3794,"Fall and spring. Believe it or not, it does get fairly cold in the desert during the winter"
3794,i believe it. does arizona have any ski resorts?
3794,"Flagstaff has skiing. Very nice hiking also. Elevation is around 8,000 feet"
3794,"oh, wow. that is awesome. i might look into trying to visit there some day. i would like to visit all 50 states at some point in my life."
3794,me too. Alaska and Hawaii will be a challenge. I like to drive when I am visiting states
3794,i like to drive too. do you camp or stay in hotels or???
3794,"Both. But, I think hotels are easier"
3794,"we have a little camper we take along usually, but i agree that hotels are way easier. and i don't have to clean up there. lol."
3794,"Yes, cleaning up and unloading the camper when you get home are not fun."
3795,I did. We were very close in age and we spent almost every weekend together. Did you grow up with a big family?
3795,"Semi-big, I have lots of cousins. They helped me get my business off the ground."
3795,That's great! What type of business do you have?
3795,I sell homemade candles and soaps. Trying to expand my market. Are you a fan of any sports?
3795,I love college football. How about you?
3795,"Me too, Hook 'em Horns! I love basketball too"
3795,I love that football is such a big thing in Texas. I am from a big basketball state but I don't like it as much as football.
3795,Do you have a favorite NBA team?
3795,I don't. Growing up I liked the Charlotte Hornets though. What team do you follow?
3795,San Antonio Spurs because it's a requirement down here lol
3795,That makes total sense. I'm nearest to to the Cleveland Cavs.
3795,Oh okay I'm gonna say they're my second favorite. Gotta love LeBron
3796,i am going to a party
3796,Sounds like a good time! Have fun at the party!
3796,i hope i will. do you have plans next week?
3796,"No plans yet, I'm just happy to sleep in"
3796,"yeah, that's my favorite."
3796,I appreciate Saturdays for that for sure
3796,what do you do for fun?
3796,"I go to church, fellowship, listen to sermons...it blesses my heart. The Lord is not spoke of enough."
3796,"i agree, He isn't spoken of enough."
3796,"He is spoken of it seems less and less, unfortunately."
3796,"I agree, it is so sad."
3796,And the morals are more left up to the law and what hollywood puts out on movies and shows...that shouldn't be our guide for sure.
3797,Well that's something I didn't know. That beverage is my favourite drink while I paint.
3797,I drink it all the time
3797,Oh is that so? What a coincidence.
3797,It's my favorite and one of the most consumed beverages in the world
3797,"Ah well, it is a great spring drink. Already ready for winter to pass so I can get to my favourite season!"
3797,I love winter and the snow
3797,"Winter is a close second in my opinion, only for the cozy times with a hot chocolate in your hands."
3797,I like hot chocolate with marshmallows 
3797,Ooo that's definitely a winner! But the spring flowers always attracts me more.
3797,True but I prefer it cold over hot
3797,That's why spring is the best! It's the perfect medium.
3797,I still prefer winter 
3798,that is so nice of you! what hobbies do you like?
3798,I love running and try to improve my speed as the days go by. How about you?
3798,that is incredible! good for you! I like to work out but I am just starting.
3798,"Good job, it's always good to hit the gym and to stay in shape.  I just started again as well."
3798,"thank you so much! i appreciate that and understand how starting can go! good luck to you, as well.  I do enjoy being healthy"
3798,Do you eat healthy? I'm bad about never eating my vegetables.
3798,"well, I love fishing so I do eat alot of fish. it's hard to remember to eat veggies! do you like fish?"
3798,"I love fish, especially fried! That's the southern in me. I enjoy fishing as well."
3798,yes! We share a like minded-ness! 
3798,What things we have in common! Maybe we can be online workout buddies.
3798,that would be funny! what is your favorite color?
3798,I love teal and red but wear a lot of black. That's weird of me!
3799,What is your favorite animal? 
3799,I'm kind of drawn to birds. I think it's the freedom they enjoy that makes them interesting
3799,"They do have a lot of freedom. Did you know that an armadillos name in spanish means ""little armored one""?"
3799,No I didn't know that! Do you enjoy little known facts?
3799,I do. Like they are also called hillbilly speed bumps. 
3799,"Here's one, I write poetry. The world's shortest poem is a four-legged version of the letter M"
3799,I love poetry but I just cant write it. 
3799,It's so soothing. I help homeless people and draw a lot of inspiration from their experiences.
3799,Like I tried to do it in one of my college classes but it was hard. I love fun facts about animals and crime reports. 
3799,We're kind of on the same path. My poetry is drawn from real things too. Animals and crime? Why those subjects?
3799,Well I love crime and I feel some animals have a lot of freedoms that we as human beings do not have. 
3799,"True words. It's like we want to be free but also need security, don't you think?"
3799,That is very true. We are just in this need for security even though we want to make our own laws and do our own thing. 
3800,"I love jogging, gotta love that runner's high though lol. I feel like I'm pretty strong but I could do better"
3800,What do you eat to be so strong?
3800,I drink protein shakes and plenty of vegetables. Do you like going to the movies?
3800,"yes i do,  ever since I saw an owen wilson movie about it I have been into it"
3800,Oh I love him. I just saw Hereditary which was amazing.
3800,"Is it a horror movie, right? I don't like so much that kind of movies!"
3800,"Lol yes it is. But I like sci-fi as well, and action"
3800,It's cool. It's not for everyone. I'm a nerd at heard so I love science fiction.
3800,Oh great then you must love Marvel movies. Endgame was insane!
3800,"I've never seen all of it, but I've heard nothing but good things about Avengers: Infinity War."
3800,"Oh me and my kids have watched it so many times it's ridiculous. Black Panther, Captain America, we love them all"
3800,"I recently watched Black Panther and I loved it! I'm not normally into Marvel movies, but it was so good. Chadwick Boseman was fantastic as T'Challa"
3801,"Tell me again, what industry are you in."
3801,"I work in radiology, it's a really rewarding field of work to be in."
3801,"Ah yes, in medicine.  That must take a lot of time.  I have a lot.  I am single."
3801,"haha. it's alot of work but it's rewarding. Yes, I'm single too, the hours can be a bit anti-social"
3801,"Well, I am a male, so I am looking for my lily of the valley."
3801,"Yes. I love the name Lily. It reminds me of my favorite actress Lily Winters, from the Young and the Restless. I know that sounds cheesy"
3801,"No, not at all.  I don't really watch shows in that ilk.  I am more action adventure."
3801,"i can dig it . I liove adventure too. SO do some of the people I've helped in my job, the patients. Some of them enjoy adventure too much!"
3801,"That reminds me, I had a doctor for surgery recently went to Africa the last I heard.  He just died.  Nice guy."
3801,"Wow that is terrible, I hope he got to live a long life before that happened. I bet he helped a lot of people throughout his life."
3801,Yes he did.  Wonderful person.  And he was only 75.  Way too young.
3801,Yes it really is too bad he died at such a young age.
3802,My dream is to go down and take pictures of the great barrier reef
3802,That would be fun. To see the coral reef up close.
3802,Have you ever been there?  I love to travel
3802,I've never traveled much. My life is pretty simple but it does sound like fun.
3802,"It does.  I hope to become a famous photographer, so that will pay to see all of the world"
3802,My idea of a camera is a point and shoot type.  Again...very simple. That sounds amazing to me.
3802,Sometimes that catches the beautiful candid moments.  What do you like to do?
3802,I like the simple life.  Fishing off the peer is fun for me. Watching nature go by.
3802,I can imagine that.  You go fishing and I photograph it.  I like the early morning sun reflecting on the water.
3802,That sounds like a plan. Early morning is the best time. That's when all of nature wakes up.
3802,I agree.  I get some of my best photographs of deer in the field at that time when it is just dawn.
3802,"Yes, I've seen them. They ignore me when I'm fishing. "
3803,I am an elementary school teacher.
3803,that sounds challenging. what ages do you teach?
3803,I am a 5th grade math teacher. What do you do foe a living?
3803,i am a personal chef.
3803,Wow! That sounds like fun. Do you have consistent clients that you work for?
3803,just one family and then sometimes i do catering. i just love cooking so much.
3803,Do you work different hours throughout the week or is your schedule pretty consistent?
3803,for the family they are very consistent. i do breakfast and dinner. if they're having a special party it will be different that day.
3803,Do you cook by yourself or do you have help?
3803,"by myself. it's not a big family; just 5 of them. when i do parties i have 1 or 2 helpers, though."
3803,how long have you been a personal chef?
3803,about 4 years. i worked in restaurants before that.
3804,no ive just been working hard for whatever i want 
3804,"Oh ok. I'm the same, I hate losing so I always give it my all. "
3804,me too im an orphan so i learnt to rely on myself 
3804,Oh I'm sorry to hear that. My father died when I was two. so I know how that kind of absence drives you.
3804,sorry to hear that i guess its a little bit of rainbow they leave behind
3804,Right exactly I agree. Do you ever get to watch movies? Any favorites?
3804,i love avatar and minions 
3804,Avatar is fantastic. You gotta check out Alita: Battle Angel. It's incredible.
3804,ok thanks i will give that a try just watched mortal engines which was fab
3804,Oh I gotta check that out. Do you have a favorite food?
3804,i love italian food you?
3804,"Mexican food...enchiladas, tacos, all that"
3805,do you do any volunteer work?
3805,"No, not really. I don't have much spare time, so my good deeds are for my elderly family members."
3805,"oh they are blessed to have you, that is precious."
3805,Thank you. Do you play any sports? I play soccer.
3805,"no, no sports. I do watch some with my husband and son sometimes though. They like football and hockey."
3805,I bet you all enjoy watching games together. Last month I joined a new soccer team and I'm getting used to the new dynamic at practices.
3805,oh that sounds fun. Our son did soccer is junior high school one year.
3805,"Oh, I bet you enjoyed watching his soccer games! Hey, what kind of volunteer work do you do?"
3805,"well, I do help the church when I can with fundraisers. They just built a little bit bigger building."
3805,That's great. The community aspect of church is fun.
3805,It is clean and good fun. Have a good weekend!!!
3805,"thank you , i will , you have a wonderful day too !"
3806,I think the vegan industry is growing at a rapid pace.  
3806,"Yes, it is. I am a vegetarian at this time. I don't know how long I can go without meat!"
3807,My cat ran away once and became feral. Such a shame. Once they get the taste of the outdoors that's normally them gone.
3807,I've heard that before. My cat Lella is a ham. She has her own YouTube show.
3807,"Oh wow, that does sound interesting. My dog wouldn't sit still long enough to take a picture. She does't like her halloween costume either this year."
3807,She plays with her toys and people love it. Seems silly but so much fun.
3807,Pets bring such job into our lives don't you agree?
3807,I do agree.  Leela has a tutu for Halloween. What is your dog dressing up as?
3808,I'm a vet tech so movies about raging animals are some of the scariest to me lol
3808,"I live in Kansas and feel I should be a fan of The Wizard Of Oz, ha ha"
3808,Lol that's a great classic. What's your favorite food?
3808,"Oh my goodness! Allsorts! I like to make experimental dishes, probably Indian food, yourself?"
3808,I've only had Indian twice but I love it. I'm gonna say Mexican food for myself
3808,Nothing better than cooking up a new dish and settling down in front of a bit of reality tv for me. Love Mexican too!
3808,"I know THAT's right. I haven't seen a lot of reality tv lately, I love Netlix series though"
3808,Agree! Netflix make such good shows. Have you been to Mexico?
3808,Never have but I'd love to go soon. You?
3808,"Lucky to have been twice. Loved Mexico, have you traveled much?"
3808,I've never been anywhere outside of the states but I wanna visit Rome in the future
3808,"Me too. The Vatican, Colosseum etc. Love European history, do you?"
3809,Interesting! so would you say that its worth it?
3809,"Absolutely.  Of course there are drawbacks to it that are outside my control, but I wouldn't change it."
3809,According to my mother she says that sometimes wants to hit someone with a broom. when the kids get annoying XD
3809,"True.  Kids can be pretty infuriating. Especially at very young ages. hahaha.  Although if that's her reaction, she might think of retirement. haha"
3809,"Lol same, but she says that they always know how to pull at her heart strings. How cute "
3809,That is so true!  So cute!  I even bring them in apples from my own garden instead of them bringing me one. haha
3809,Oh nice :] Do you ever wish you could follow them though teenage years like my Mother sometimes wishes?
3809,"Oh yeah.  When I interned, I felt the need to keep track of the kids even after classes were over."
3809,I guess eventually letting them go gets easier. 
3809,Yes! It sure does! How long has your mom been teaching for?
3809,23 years and she says its all worth it
3809,That's amazing! :)  What an inspiration to someone like me.  
3810,It just seems so awkward since they went back to school. You have a music store?
3810,I do. I work in a factory part time also and do stand up comedy when I can
3810,That sounds amazing. I do not know where I would want to retire. 
3810,What kind of hobbies do you have
3810,That is a good question. I don't really think I have any hobbies. 
3810,There has to be something you like to do
3810,I love sleeping when I actually can. 
3810,I'm the opposite. I have chronic insomnia
3810,I am so sorry to hear that. How do you deal with it?
3810,I just deal with it mostly. It gets worse with certain environmental factors.
3810,If you don't mind me asking. What kind of environmental factors?
3810,If It is cold I don't sleep well. Depends on the things I eat also.
3810,Is that why you want to retire in Florida?
3811,"Theyre always asking me about how much money I make. I only make 30k a year, but they insist for me to lend them money. "
3811,"Well, I understand how you feel. Maybe you can explain your financial situation to them?"
3811,"Thank you. Honestly, I have tried, however they're not very understanding. They think I sit around and watch tv all day. "
3811,How long ago did you lend them this money?
3811,It has been over a month ago. You would think they would be stable by now. My 30k budget is very strict since I live in a one bedroom apartment.
3811,"Oh no :( Well, I would definitely tell them that I am unable to help out this time. I hope that they are not taking advantage of your kindness."
3811,I hope not. I know they're good people deep down. It's why I watch tv so much. It helps me cope with society. 
3811,"I know things may seem overwhelming at times, but it will get better. Go out and treat yourself to a nice inexpensive dinner and movie :)"
3811,I appreciate your kind words. Maybe I will go ahead and do that tonight. I definitely deserve a pat on the back every once in awhile.
3811,you will be rewarded for your kindness. Sometimes you have to be a little selfish and also to tell yourself that you deserve to be happy :)
3811,"Thank you. I will start giving myself more self-love. 30k isn't much, but I will put it to better use this time."
3811,Not a problem I know times are tough but just keep your chin up and you will get through it. Don't forget to put money aside for a rainy day!
3812,Oh that's cool. New hobbies are fun. I started playing the piano not too long ago.
3812,I love playing instrument but i don't have patience. but I  have pond in my garden
3812,It's not for everyone that is for sure. The pond must be a relaxing spot to spend time.
3812,Yeah it is and even i have one pet koi named spot. So whenever I am getting Chance love to walk around there 
3812,That's cool. Do you spend time there mostly on your days off work?
3812,I spend more time on weekends.
3812,Weekends are usually the best time to do things. I spend my weekends paddle boarding.
3812,Yeah I never tried  paddle boarding. How is it?
3812,It's relaxing to me. Balance is very important.
3812,I will try one day when i get chance to do for sure
3812,It is worth trying. It'll take time to understand how to do it properly. Just like gardening I'm sure.
3813,I don't wanna come off as too desperate. I teach at a large school so it's easy to meet but hard to maintain
3813,I think it's easiest when you do it as a way to flirt in order to see how interested they are.
3813,Right exactly. I graduated college back in 2016 so I'm pretty green. Did you go to college?
3814,i am heartbroken but im still in college so just trying too focus on that to get me through
3814,"well, it's good you have something else to focus on. i hate hearing about things like this but i know people get through it."
3814,im such a social butterfly normally but it makes you distrust people 
3814,"i can understand that. he was probably the person you most trusted, too. i hope you can realize that most people are good, though."
3814,thankyou me too hows your day going ?
3814,it's going well. i've been saving up to buy a new camera so i'm doing some comparison shopping online.
3814,ooh that's exciting i have one for college as i take photography 
3814,what kind do you have? there are so many choices i'm having a hard time deciding.
3814,a cannon eos 5d the picture quality is fab 
3814,"oh, very nice! a friend of mine recommended that one as well, but it's more than i have. maybe i should save up a while longer."
3814,it is worth it but i normally always go middle of the range
3814,i see. is it a difficult camera to learn to use? i am such a beginning photographer.
3815,It takes a lot of time and patience. I need to practice eating healthier though. 
3815,"Keep training yourself everyday, and stop eating foods that affect you poorly "
3815,"Definitely, I have to have a soda with me at all times. Caffeine addict lol. You drink coffee?"
3815,"I drink coffee, but I try to limit it to one serving .I was getting to where I liked Ice coffee in the afternoons but was getting headaches"
3815,Yeah Starbucks is a hazard for me. What's your favorite food?
3815,Oh definitely Italian food. How about you?
3815,Mexican food for me. I live in Texas lol
3815,"I'm in ""North North Texas"" aka Kansas!"
3815,"I love that lol! We're happy about this cold weather coming in, summer was brutal"
3815,"I heard Amaraillo got snow the other day... Crazy! No snow here, summer could have been worse. We had a lot of rain."
3815,Now that's nuts. Whenever we get just a layer of snow on the ground we try to make mini snowmen lol
3815,"I can do without the snow. Idiots here don't know how to drive in it and a flake falls from the sky, they're closing everyhting"
3816,"culinary school, huh? what's your favorite type of food to cook?"
3816,I like hamburgers. And so do my two dogs. So I make them a lot. 
3816,"That's fair. I love a good hamburger, especially with a nice cold doctor pepper on the side."
3816,Sounds good. I usually drink iced tea with mine.
3816,"Alrighty. So, what do you do for a living?"
3816,I do drug and alcohol screening for companies
3816,That's pretty dope (get my pun?). I'm a comic book illustrator.
3816,Sounds great. So I guess you work from home. 
3816,"Most days, yeah. We have an office I go into for meetings and stuff though."
3816,I would love to work from home. I have to walk up and down three flights of stairs. 
3816,"oof, that's rough. the office is on the first floor, so I don't have to do stairs even when I DO go in."
3816,I need to get another apartment on a lower floor. 
3817,france
3817,oh wow.. first time going to france?
3817,"yes , looking forward to it. Have you been?"
3817,"No, I've never been there, but I hear it is a really lovely place. Would love to go and see it's culture!"
3818,I don't know that much about her. Wasn't she on Mickey Mouse Club?
3818,"Yes, she plays 80's music and I grew up in the 80's. She worked on there alongside many other famous names."
3818,I'll have to look her up on my computer. My cats like to lay on the keyboard.
3818,"Yes, cats have a habit of doing that. I think they like the heat from the monitor."
3818,When you have as many as I do they become a problem.  I have to work from home just to take care of them.
3818,"It's rewarding though i guess, how many do you have?"
3818,I have 10. Two of the mothers had kittens and the rest is history.
3818,"Wow, that's a lot of cats. DO you have insurance for them? I can imagine vets bills would be high for that many."
3818,Yes on the insurance. It's rough.  Do you think Brittany would like a kitten or two? lol
3818,I could certainly see her with a few cats. Haha
3818,Maybe she could make a music video with them and make us all rich!
3818,That would be awesome wouldn't it?
3819, I know I said I've never lived anywhere but th states but I'm actually in the third grade and just recently move here from France last year lol
3819,"LOL! It's hard to remember the past when you're in 3rd grade. I don't speak French, but I teach Japanese in a high school. Do you speak French?"
3819,"I do, fluently. I'm learning Spanish at the moment"
3819,Awesome! Spanish is considered the second-most spoken native language. You're very smart to learn as many languages as you can. 
3819,I love the idea of being a polyglot. Feels like you could have more access to the world and other cultures.
3819,"I agree. You can travel, or teach, or translate. Languages are very useful. Do you enjoy the creative arts? I teach drawing classes."
3819,I do I love painting and I'm a write as well. What is the age group of your students?
3819,"15 to 18 years old, mostly. It's cool that you love to paint and write. You'll be expressing yourself in 3 diff languages in no time!"
3819,I really hope so. Do you have a favorite movie?
3819,"I have several! I loved Shaun of the Dead, and Tropic Thunder, just off the top of my head. What do you like?"
3819,"Lol I love those too. I'm a horror fan so The Shining, Us, Hereditary, movies like that"
3819,"The Shining is always awesome to watch. I loved it too. Do you watch The Walking Dead, too?"
3820,That makes sense! I have an office job so I have to sit a lot every day. What do you do for work?
3820,I work as an accountant at a large corporation so I sit in one of those chairs all day long as well.
3820,That's interesting! Do you have any hobbies?
3820,"I like to hike but unfortunately, I have chronic back problems so I only go on easy hikes once in a while."
3820,I'm sorry about that. I like to hike too but I'm so busy with work I haven't been in almost a year.
3820,"Yes, it can be tough to get out there with work. I hope you're able to go for a hike again soon! Do you have any hobbies?"
3820,Thank you! I like to embroider and play the saxophone. Do you play any instruments?
3821,I might try my hand at hunting bears LoL
3821,Bears? I like your style. A little too much for me!
3821,I think that it will be worth the patience and reward. i just hope i don't get eaten  
3821,I'm sure it would be worth it. Definitely something to show-off and be proud of!
3821,Thanks bud:] how long have you hunted for ?
3821,"9 years, It just feels lonely here at home now. I'm probably depressed."
3821,Yeah the great outdoors can be a perfect tool for depression.
3821,Sure is! It helps most of the time. I love the outdoors.
3821,Outdoors just lets you forget everything and be one with nature . It makes realize how small we all are
3821,"Definitely! It really changes your perspective on life sometimes, and helps you to relax....until you see a bear....lol"
3821,Then you run like hell when that happens XD 
3821,Hahaha....do you think you could out-run a bear?  They are pretty big!
3822,We like lives that are worse than us I think. I watch a few reality shows and it seems most of the premises of them is gossiping. 
3822,"Agreed. Guilty- I'm a pretty big gossiper myself, so I can't really blame any of the people on those shows for what they do."
3822,I don't really have anyone to gossip to. Work restricts me and best friend hates it. 
3822,"That stinks. Personally, I'm not restricted by much in this life."
3822,*shrugs* it is what it is. Probably for the best. I'd probably not work and talk all day! What kind of work do you do?
3822,"I'm a student right now, Gotta achieve my goals somehow, you know?"
3822,Yes. Good luck with that. I work in Human Resources.
3822,"Nice. A big company, or no?"
3822,you could say so ... laughs ... government!
3822,lol. that's not exactly what I'm gonna be doing in 20 years xD
3822,be careful what you promise yourself. Never planned on this life either ... lol
3822,Good advice. I'm just not too worried about what the future holds.
3822,keep your eyes and options open. Be open to change and taking small risks. You'll do fine! =)
3823,"Yes, I work as a vet so you think it would be a bit easier. Hard seeing other animals each day when you've just lost your own."
3823,was your cat sick or old?
3823,"Both really, it was the kindest thing to do I guess."
3823,Losing a pet can be very challenging. I lost my dog to cancer a few months ago.
3823,It's incredibly difficult to go through. Many people do not realise how we grow attached to our pets.
3823,"Yes, they love unconditionally and quickly become part of the family."
3823,"Very quickly, and then they're sadly gone just as quick. Like angels on loan. Sorry to hear about your dog."
3823,"Thank you. It is sometimes harder on the children. Also on the other pets, my other dog still misses him."
3823,"Yes, it's hard on everybody who loved them. And children don't really understand."
3823,"I agree. But, I still would not want to live in a house without pets."
3823,They truly make a house a home. 
3823,"Yes, they complete the family."
3824,My family has been working with trains for generations.
3824,"That's pretty cool. I was an Army brat, but my brother also collected trains."
3824,Trains are fading away.  I see our future more like Star Trek.  Do you watch it?
3824,"Yep, I'm a Star Trek fan. I like the new one on CBS All Access with Sonequa Green Martin."
3824,Me too!  I can't wait for the new season to come out.
3824,"Me too! I hope we do have space travel like in Star Trek. And since I'm a nurse, I want their super advanced medical tools."
3824,Lol. I agree!  Maybe they will find other inhabited planets that still use trains!
3824,"Absolutely! That would be amazing. Or a planet where they still use horses for travel. Wait, that's West World LOL."
3824,lol...too funny.  I'd like a food replicator to make my meals.
3824,Oh definitely! I wish I'd thought of that first. Do you ever watch The Orville?
3824,Yes. One of my favorites. I didn't think I'd like it at first but now I'm hooked.
3824,The same for me. But I ended up liking it. They have some very creative aliens aboard ship.
3825,I plan on starting to look for a job. I did really stack up student loans these past few years.
3825,"Oh no! Hopefully you land a suitable job. To take some of the stress away, I draw frequently to take my mind off. "
3825,Really? What sort of things do you like drawing?
3825,"I like to draw landscapes, but now I'm drawing sketches of the human body and face. I find it very fascinating. "
3825,Neat! Do you just draw with pencils or do you use something else like charcoal?
3825,I have a sketching box with special types of pencils and charcoal utensils. I also watch movies which serve as the inspiration to most of my drawings.
3825,What sort of movies do you like? I like science fiction. My current favorite show is Face Off on syfy. Have you seen it?
3825,I am actually not familiar with Face Off. I do enjoy science fiction very much. I have seen Battlestar Galactica as well as Star Trek. 
3825,I enjoyed those shows. Have you done any drawings inspired from those shows?
3825,Yes I have actually! I have drawn Tiberius as well as Picard. I even included perma-color pencils to give them color so they look more realistic.
3825,"I would love to see those! You should check out Face Off fir inspiration, I feel the drawings would look fantastic!"
3825,I definitely will. Thanks for the recommendation. My favorite type of movies to sketch from include those of Super Heroes like Batman or Spiderman.
3826,"I know, but with everything going on in society, it is safety in numbers :)"
3826,Do you have a Netflix subscription? Then you can watch movies on your couch without worrying what some nut might do in a theater.
3826,"No, I do not. I've had it before. May try it out again when I can afford to do so. "
3826, I've gone to baseball games alone. It's actually kind of fun being with a like-minded crowd cheering on your team.
3826,"Cool, I am glad that you have a hobby to travel alone to. Baseball is cool, the games are very long though!"
3826,They are long but fun. I went to Stanford and always to the the Stanford-Cal games. I love beating them!
3826,"Yeah, I catch a few games on tv every once in a while. I bet those games were always competitive! Maybe I'll attend a live one someday."
3827,my husband is scared of heights so im taking a friend from my reading group 
3827,Lol! My wife also same like him
3827,do you like to read ?
3827,Yeah I like reading. My dream is to start my own programming company 
3827,"that would be amazing for you, who's you favourite author  mine is stephen king "
3827,Mine is James patterson
3827,he is brilliant too . do you have any other hobbies ?
3827,Usually I play sports .My favorite sport is  basketball. Do you like sport? 
3827,yes i like running and yoga
3827,Both are good health even I do yoga daily
3827,it keeps you mentally well too important with the busy lives we lead nower days
3827,Exactly now days its very important to balance work life and healthy life
3828,I see. That's in innneresting fact. You have a lot of knowleg. Were you a good student in skool?
3828,"I was, or at least that's what my family told me. They support me even at my worst."
3828,"Good for u! I think I was bad in skool. I could never learn how to speell very well. As you can see, I have lots of trouble."
3828,"Don't worry! It just takes lots of practice, they say English is the hardest language to learn! "
3828,Thank you for the encoragment. Maybe Ill study speelling on the weekends. Most weeknights I'm busy volunteering. 
3828,Volunteering is great for the community! I see you have a good heart.
3828,Have you ever vollunteered? I like to help out at the local animal shelter. 
3828,"That's great! I tend to volunteer at the place where my mother works, you see she's a ballerina. I help with the stage setup!"
3828,Wow! What an interesting profession your mom has. 
3828,"Indeed, she's always had a passion for dance since she was a kid I was told."
3828,What do you want your profession to be?
3828,"I'm not yet sure, but I know my family will support whatever my choice will be!"
3829,"Yes, I definitely empathize with the characters, and imagine the crimes happening to me, but I enjoy them so much also!"
3829,Yeah I agree. The crimes are mostly murder with serial killer dominating the genre (about 40%).
3829,"When I have nothing else to do, I read books, but its the same thing."
3829,I like books too. I've read 40 so far this year. 
3829,Wow! I wish I had that much time on my hands. Reading is relaxing.
3829,I have a lot of free time. I was born into a wealthy family. 
3829,"Opposite here, have had to work hard nearly everyday since I was 16, but I used to be in the Marines also"
3829,Can't choose our parents. Mine is a well known celebrity but she has had a lot of problems. 
3829,"I would imagine that is still pretty cool, compared to how I was raised.  My Mom has passed."
3829,"Sorry to hear that. For me, I'm just tired of appearing on the news talking about my mother. "
3829,I would imagine. Different shoes to walk in I suppose.
3829,True. Even wealthy people have problems. But not as bad as others. 
3830,"hmm, an interesting combination. I may try that myself later when my friend comes to visit from out of town."
3830,"but for regular meals, I like drink Coke when I have pizza"
3830,"Ah, now you're talking. Pizza is my favourite! But the question is... pineapple or no pineapple?"
3830,Team Pineapple (& Canadian Bacon) pizza all the way!
3830,"I can only assume the people against it have never tried it before. Tomato is a fruit too, yet they don't object to the sauce. "
3830,Exactly. But tomato is much more acidic and less sweet. I like the juxtaposition of sweet with the savory.
3830,"Me too, that's what truly makes a pizza."
3830,A lot of people love Asian food -- which combines sweet & savory .... but hardly no one complains of it!
3830,"Nope, they just want to pick on the pizza instead. "
3830,poor pineapple.... lol .... and anchovies get no love either.
3830,People do get a bit salty about anchovies. I'm kind of on the fence with those.
3830,"I don't like them whole, but melted into the pizza sauce gives it good flavor."
3831,Good morning!
3831,"Good morning! I know embarrassment is tough, but I'd like to assure you that you can overcome this. I used to be nurse you know."
3831,"When I am in front of a large audience and accidently key in a note incorrectly, it can be very frustrating."
3831,I know the feeling. I would recommend that you shift your thoughts in a way that doesn't stop you or is afraid of failure. Believe in yourself.
3831,I guess part of the frustration is because of dealing with the current passing of my father.
3831,"That is incredibly tough. I'm truly very sorry. When life is painful, I make maps since I am currently a cartographer. "
3832,i used to be a cook in india then escaped and became a carpenter
3832,I see. Do you like Indonesian cuisine? It has a very intense flavor as well.
3832,yes i do i met my wife in Indonesia on holiday 10 years later we then got married
3832,That's interesting. Have you traveled anywhere lately?
3832,yes i went to france a few weeks ago you ?
3832,I went to Argentina over the summer. It was great. 
3832,oh wow whats it like there ?
3832,"Super nice, the locals were always willing to help us navigate around, and had great recommendations for things to try while we were there."
3832,sounds really nice i will have to look into their for our next holiday 
3832,i definitely recommend it . what do you like to do for fun ?
3832,i like to walk my dogs and rollerblade what do you do for fun ?
3832,I like to run. Mostly I go at night because it's very peaceful. 
3833,I just froze. I'm not very big and didn't want a confrontation. What would you do?
3833,I don't like confrontation either. I think I'd have peeked out my window to see what was going on outside and then call 911 if needed.
3833,"It was just a car misfiring in the end. I wish I was tall enough to reach the cookie jar, I'd have been braver, ha ha. "
3833,"Oh, you're sly! Call the cookie addiction hotline quick! I'm an accountant and would've counted those cookies and known if any were missing~"
3833,"Ha ha, an accountant? Wow, great job! I would love a porsche, maybe become an accountant?"
3833,"Haha! No, I have a Corvette convertible and let my long, black, curly hair blow in the wind! It's awesome :)"
3833,You are one cool accountant my friend. What do you do when not number crunching?
3833,I body surf in the nearby ocean and play volleyball. How about you?
3833,Wow! Nothing as cool and active. Love walking and reading. You must love living by the ocean?
3833,"Hey! Yes, I do actually especially when it's nice out. I also love reading. I'm addicted to FanFiction!"
3833,Love it! FanFiction is so cool! Do you like to travel?
3833,"Yeah, I love to travel! Although, I usually go for short stays. Do you like to travel?"
3834,"oh interesting, but I do not like Dog so much, I am more a Cat person"
3834,What do you like about cats? 
3834, I like soft hair
3834,"Okay, lol. I think I'll stick with dogs. I just love them so much! Speaking of what we love, what's your favorite color?"
3834,"Dogs are nice too, but I don't like dog smell, My favorite color is Black what about you?"
3834,"Black! That's goth as heck, cool! I love purple best. "
3834,hehehe and Do you like trains? 
3834,"Oh boy, yes! I love trains. Especially old Soviet and Chinese trains. "
3834,"nice! my dad has one, it is a old one, I love to play with that train"
3834,"Cool. I've never had a toy train, but I like to take real trains. I once took a train from Moscow to Vladivostock ."
3834,really? and how was your experience?
3834,It was very enjoyable. The food on board was delicious and I met some nice people in my cabin. 
3835,Those are great! I like ribeye steaks on the grill. What kind of side dishes do you like with steak?
3835,Sun dried tomatoes and homemade chips. I grew up on a farm and we've become a bot of an authority on steaks in this house.
3835,What was it like growing up on a farm? I've always lived in cities.
3835,"Very quiet, our closest neighbour was 10 miles away! Lonely growing up as a child, bu t I had the animals to keep me company."
3835,"Sounds peaceful, though. What kind of animals did your parents keep?"
3835,Pretty much all meat bred animals. You try not to get too attached to them.
3835,I can imagine. Do they still have the farm?
3835,Unfortunately not. They got too old to handle the daily runnings when I moved.
3835,"Well, I guess farmers are having a tough time of it now. Maybe they got out in time."
3835,"They did, I'm sure they miss it though."
3835,Do you still live in a rural area?
3835,"I do, I still enjoy the countryside after all these years!"
3836,"Carrots and parsnips must be related.  They look alike, except for their color."
3836,"Yes, they are very similar. They also pair very well in many dishes!"
3836,Do you like to cook?
3836,yes i love it!
3836,I liked to roast carrots.  I think roasting brings out the sweetness.
3836,"i agree they taste awesome when roasted, but I also love them sauteed with other vegetables! Yum :)"
3836,"You're right!  I sautee them with Vidalia onions, asparagus, and red, yellow, and orange peppers."
3836,Definitely a great combo. Maybe we can trade recipes sometimes?
3836,"Sure.  I'm always looking for good vegetarian recipes.  I'm trying to be as healthy as possible, cutting way down on red meat."
3836,Good idea. Best to have a variety of healthier options. What is your diet like now? I love seafood!
3836,"I love seafood, too!  That's why I can never be a vegetarian!  I toss shrimp in my veggie medley and sprinkle with sesame seeds."
3836,"Ehh, don't really care for shrimp, clams, or shellfood. Love salmon, haddock, and a variety of Kosher fish though :)"
3837,"My Grandma loves him, my dentist loves him, my niece loves him....he's a star for all ages!"
3837,"Yes, he was very talented and loved by many."
3837,How old was he when he died?
3837,I believe he was in his early eighties.
3837,"I would have loved to see him live,his son was pretty amazing too."
3837,I never had the opportunity but I have heard his concerts were amazing.
3837,I'm sure! The entire rat-pack would have been amazing to see. I've seen impersonators only.
3837,I did see an impersonator in Vegas one time before and it was okay.
3837,"I would imagine that's where the best ones would be, but no one comes close to the original, I'm sure."
3837,You're right. Nothing is close to the original Frank.
3837,For sure
3837,I have seen his documentary on HBO before and it was really entertaining.
3838,I am sorry to hear that. I actually have a law degree. 
3838,"Wow, fancy. Do you want to be a lawyer then? Cause I don't. In fact, I don't want any job. "
3838,"I am a practicing attorney, yes."
3838,A noble profession. I bet you have helped many people but are quite busy. Do you have time to do things like cook?
3838,Sometimes. Why don't you want to work? My work allows me to help people and additionally to have nice things like a vacation home in the mountains.
3838,I am one of those paleo anarchist guys who believes in a society without money or whatever. 
3838,But you are already enjoying the benefits of a society that goes against everything you state you believe in.
3838,"You're right. For example, I eat take out for every meal. Cognitive dissonance, am I right?"
3838,Well you seem reasonably intelligent. Why don't you get a job that helps to repair what you find broken with society?
3838,"I sense some condescension and sarcasm coming from you. Let me live, G"
3838,"Well, hey, G, if you continue to eat takeout for every meal and buck society, you are going to die young."
3838,"Dang, that hits deep. Actually I don't want a job because I'm retired. I eat take out because I get Meals on Wheels delivered cause I'm old and disabled :("
3839,"Nope, I've dedicated my life to medical school. Once I've finished with that maybe."
3839,What kind of medicine do you want to specialize in?
3839,I'd like to work in the pharmaceutical sector.
3839,That sounds great. I'd like to go to college but I've never been in a city. Seems overwhelming.
3839,Do you live in the country?
3839,I do. I love the rural life. It's so peaceful.
3839,I wouldn't know what that's like. Always lived in the city.
3839,I live in a small coastal community in the northeast. The ocean is really nice.
3839,I do love the ocean when I get chance to visit. Can you hear the waves at night?
3839,I can! It's really soothing and it's so nice to fall asleep to it. Maybe I'll venture out of my comfort zone some day.
3839,Definitely worth it. Maybe i'll take time to appreciate nature more too.
3839,How many more years of college do you have left?
3840,and what is your favorite writer? mine is Nicholas Sparks
3840,yes hes great my favourite writer is stephen king. what do you do for work ?
3840,I am Eletronic Engineer I have my own company
3840,oh wow that sounds interesting i work at a day care centre what do your parents do ?
3840,"My dad is engineer too, he work for oil company and my mom is cosmetologist and your?"
3840,my dad is a dentist and my mum is a teacher why did you choose to be an electric engineer?
3840," for my dad, he was a electric technician and always was repairing stuff at home"
3840,oh cool my uncles an engineer im not actually sure what type though
3840,and do you like cook? I love it
3840,yes i enjoy cooking do you have a favourite food ?
3840,my favorite one is pizza and shrimp
3840,not tried that combo sounds nice i will have to try it 
3841,"yes, but she eventually understood because I was swamped with school ya know?"
3841,Well since you apologized you should be fine. What school do you go to?
3841,I am going to school to become a vet.  Do you think my mom will be okay
3841,Your mom will be fine. A vet that is cool profession. I take it you love pets?
3841,"Yes, very much.  Do you like animals? Do you have any pets of your own?"
3841,No I can't have any pets as my wife has many allergies to pets.
3841,Are you saddened by that? Do you ever wish that you could have pets?
3841,No I am ok with it. So how many more years of school before you become a vet?
3841,"Thanks for asking, this will be my last year.  Do you work for a living?"
3841,Yes I am Director of IT for a major media and entertainment business. 
3841,"Nice, those are some major accomplishments.  How is your relationship with your mother?"
3841,my mom is great . thank you for asking
3842,Do you like women? Cause I am one. 
3842,"Sure, who doesn't like women?"
3842,"I don't know, some people I guess. I live with my spouse, who, luckily, also likes women. "
3842,Ahhh I see... Is your spouse a woman?
3842,"I'm not sure. Anyway back to those wildfires. Our house did get gutted, but luckily my spouse and our dog got out safely. Do you have a dog?"
3842,WIldfires? We weren't talking about that. I don't like dogs. I'm into other hobbies... I like to hang out with my imaginary friends. 
3842,"Yeah, we were! I mean, at least I thought so... :/ Imaginary friends are the best kinds! They won't disappoint you. "
3842,"Dude, we were totally talking about your spouse or whatever. And yeah...I have like a ton of imaginary friends."
3842,"Yeah but before the spouse, we were discussing wildfires. Uh, anyway, who's your best imaginary friend? Is it Josh?"
3842,Oh yeah... right the wildfires. I'm totally chatting with my friends too. I've really been spending a lot of time with them considering what happened. 
3842,Is everything ok? What happened?
3842,"I mean, the house is totally gone. We got nada out of there before it was up in flames."
3843,"Just a bit yeah. But theyr'e pretty expensive, yeah?"
3843,They can be a bit on the pricey side depending on the breeder.
3843,I don't know. I honestly just might get a cat from the pound
3843,"That's a good choice too, Sometimes it can be more ecomomical to adopt rather than purchase ."
3843,Yup. Why pay thousands to a breeder when I can pay a few bucks at the pound
3843,That's a good idea. Or you can adopt one. I adopted two from PetsMart and it wasn't that expensive :)
3843,True. My local petstore has animals for adoption and they already come fixed and vaccinated for a couple hundred
3843,"That's what's up! Because if you bought it from a breeder they cost between $3,000-7,000 easily."
3843,"Ugh, yeah. And often they come from kitten mills and are badly bred"
3844,What are you studying in college?
3844,childrens psychology do you work or study ?
3845,"No, not yet. I haven't seen her since."
3845,She'll probably be angry...
3845,"Oh, I'm quite certain of that. She seems to have forgotten that today is my birthday. If I make it to midnight, I have a valid argument."
3845,"Send her some flowers, or a bottle of wine."
3845,I still think I should see how this plays out first. What do you think?
3845,I don't know...maybe gift wrap an onion or something...
3845,How perfectly wicked! I love that idea.
3845,"It'll make her laugh, I'll bet."
3845,or cry if she tries to peel it.
3845,"Yeah, that'll work, too..."
3845,"then it's settled, thank you for the advice, I really appreciate it."
3845,"No problem, hope it all works out."
3846,"Speaking of cats hunting mice, I actually enjoy going fishing from time to time. It is a pleasant hobby of mine to take time by the water. "
3846,"Fishing can be fun, I usually take time to go when I am on a vacation.  What kind of bait do you usually use?"
3846,Nice. I use worms or even minnows. I usually fish at the Keys since I live very close. Where do you go to fish?
3846,I go salt water fishing on the coast of Texas.  I live right by it and it is very convenient and beautiful. 
3846,Sounds lovely. I talk to my mom everyday on the phone to let her know how I'm doing. I began fishing with her at a young age. 
3846,That is very kind of you.  I am sure she is very happy you take the time to keep in touch with her.  
3846,Indeed. My mom and I share a deep bond through fishing. I always let her know if I catch anything. My best catch was a black grouper.
3846,"When my father lived, he enjoyed taking me fishing as a child as a get away from all of life's problems. Red Fish was our catch."
3846,Very nice. I bet it was a nice bonding experience as well. I appreciate those early days fishing more and more as time goes by. 
3846,The memories will always be there. I remember my father teaching me how to tie a special knot on my reel.
3846,That's beautiful. I remember calling my mom recently and recalling when she taught me how to be patient when waiting for my first catch.
3846,"My father didn't have much patient when fishing,  he always let his temper get the best of him.  Such a short tempered human being."
3847,They are protected by the dunes which are some of the largest that I have ever seen.
3847,Have you ever visited Cape Hatteras?
3847,"I currently live there in the winter, it's a wonderful place to reside."
3847,It sounds like a beautiful place. Does it get very cold in the winter?
3847,Sometimes it does get cold but pretty mild overall. The winds make it seem colder.
3847,"I enjoy shorts, flip flops, and sweatshirt weather."
3847,"That's Hatteras's in a nutshell, and wonderful seafood."
3847,I love fresh seafood. I try to get to the gulf a few times a year. Similar weather and also great seefood.
3847,The fresh shrimp and tuna in Hatteras is the best anywhere in my opinion.
3847,I enjoy fresh shrimp also. Have you ever tried red snapper?
3847,"I have, very good fish to consume."
3847,I love whole red snapper.
3847,"Excellent choice, it's hard to beat fresh snapper."
3848,those were my favorite type of movie back in the day
3848,What is your favorite romance movie?
3848,"I have a lot of favorites, but I will go with pretty in pink"
3848,"Ah, do you like other brat pack movies?"
3848,Yes! How about you?
3848,yea i really enjoy the breakfast club. i think that would be my favorite
3848,That is a great one.  I love the message of that movie.
3848,"Yea, and I feel like it has aged well"
3848,For sure!  I think it does as well.
3848,what other romance movies do you like?
3848,When Harry met Sally.  
3848,oh that's probably my favorite. It's so good!
3848,"I might have to re watch that today.  Its raining, and there is noting else to do. "
3849,I think im going to work on making more direct eye contact with people as we speak
3849,that sounds like a good plan. What else do you  do in your free time?  I plaly video games.
3849,I am not big on video games but my son definitely is. But i like to have movie night with the family
3849,What types of movies does your family like?
3849,Family Oreinted films. Quick question do you feel direct eye contact shows a level of respect to an indvidual
3849,I guess it depends. I'm not bug on eue contact myself. 
3849,Would you teach your children to look someone straight in the eye?
3849,Probably.  People tend to think you;re being honest with them.
3849,Do you feel it is disrpectful if someone does not make eye contact with you as an adult?
3849,Depends on the context and relationship I think.  Bur as a general rule I think it's a good eye to maintain eye contact.
3849,"I agree, eye contact is important"
3849,"So, how many kids do you have?"
3850,"yes, im still in high school"
3850,Do you think you are ready to be a parent?
3850,"I don't, but I will try my best.  I have a lot of support, and I'm excited."
3850,I'm sure you'll be a great parent. Do you expect to be working more before the baby?
3850,"I play ice hockey, and I'm pretty good, I'm hoping to focus on that and find work as well. I know babies are expensive."
3850,I am not one who likes to work long hours. Better get those in before the baby comes. They do need a lot of attention..
3850,"I figure my youthfulness will help me, I better take advantage of my energy now!"
3850,That is the truth. Babies are such a blessing. You will have to grow up rally fast.
3850,"yes, but I will be a cool parent! how many kids do you have?"
3850,"I have two that both have birthdays next month. One will be 23, and the other 5. I also was pregnant my senior year."
3850,So you really understand! That is quite a age difference also!
3850,I basically had to start all over again. Do you have the support of your family?
3851,It used to be in the drawer with the back scratcher but it's not there anymore.
3851,Could you call your boyfriend to see if he has it?  That might save you lots of time spent looking.
3851,Maybe I will do that. He night know where my only pair of shoes are as well.
3851,Look under the bed.  That's where my shoes always are!
3851,"True, I could have kicked them under there on accident."
3851,Do you have a pet?  Sometimes my dog steals my shoes and hides them in his bed!
3851,Yes I have two sneaky dogs. That sounds like something they would do for sure.
3851,"I think it's more likely your dogs nabbed your shoes than your boyfriend stole them, don't you?"
3851,Oh look! I found them! They were put away which is why I couldn't find them.
3851,"My mother always used to say, ""A place for everything, and everything in its place.""  So true!"
3851,Yes! It's a good thing too since I only have one pair of shoes.
3851,Any luck in finding the mailbox key?  Perhaps your luck will hold.
3852,"I'm not a picky eater, but I love cuba libre."
3852,What is cuba libre? That sounds like fancy food. Mostly I eat from the taco truck that pulls up to the job site every day.
3852,"Wow, where do you work?  By the way, it's my favourite drink!"
3852,Oh right... the drink... it's... I can't remember. Again - fancy. I work in construction actually. Right now we are building a new wing on a hospital.
3852,"Nice, I play music for a living.  I'm very lucky to have this opportunity, actually had a gig last night."
3852,"Whoa man, that's cool... what kind of music do you play?"
3852,"Yeah, I play rock inspired techno at pubs downtown."
3852,"right on. Lot of equipment,, eh?"
3852,"Yes, I have gained a lot of muscle lugging it to and from.  How do you keep in shape while eating so many tacos?"
3852,"That's the name of the game in construction. I'm always moving something, listing something.... "
3852,"You do a lot of heavy lifting, big man?"
3852,A fair amount I suppose.
3853,What type of products do you design?
3853,marketing and you? what do you do?
3853,I'm in high school.  I play drums in the band
3853,Drums are really great for making a nice rhythm to listen to.
3853,"Yea, I used to play snare, but now I play quads.  Do you do any marketing stuff I would recognize"
3853,"nah , but just you wait . someday you might see a movie i directed hehe"
3853,Cool.  I have a friend that does murals and they are pretty awesome.  What's the biggest project you've done?
3853,Mostly interiors. I try to focus my work with Art Deco style
3853,Awesome - Art deco is like from the 40's and 50's right?
3853,Yes. A good example of it would be the Chrysler Building in New York.
3853,"Lots of straight lines, right? no curves.  Kind of Frank Lloyd Wright stuff."
3853,exactly ! just like that!
3854,This beach I used to go to in Florida was all crushed seashells that they dumped to curb erosion
3854,"That's incredible! Well, beaches with manmade structures like changing rooms and showers are still nice to visit"
3854,"Definitely. I love nature, but creature comforts make it easier to appreciate the scenery"
3854,Yes and having lifeguards obviously make them safer. 
3854,"Oh, yeah. The ocean can be pretty dangerous"
3854,"I agree, There are a lot of people that are tourists , that don't know about riptides and such."
3854,"Plus jellyfish and drop offs, especially in murky water"
3854,"There are dangers, but I still enjoy going often. I really like riding my bike there. "
3854,I love longboarding out there. Especially with friends
3854,Sounds like fun. I have never tried that myself. 
3854,It's a lot more relaxing thank biking in my opinion
3854,"Maybe, but I really love riding my bike. "
3855,What is your favourite food and do you have a favourite recipe?
3855,Since I live in Texas I'm big on BBQ. I make a mean smoked brisket. Do you like to cook?
3855,"Yes, especially with onions. I also like filming too, I'd love my own cooking show one day."
3855,That would be awesome. Are you studying film in college?
3855,"I started to, but my parents got sick so I dropped out."
3855,I'm so sorry to hear that. Maybe you can pick it up again at some point.
3855,"Perhaps, I'd love to be the next Spielberg. I guess filming my cats doing weird stuff will work for now though."
3855,How many cats do you have? I have a tuxedo cat who loves brawling with my dog.
3855,"16 cats. We have a dog too, but he minds his business."
3855,"With 16 cats that's a smart dog. Mine can barely handle one cat, who outsmarts him daily."
3855,"Cats are very smart, but dogs are loyal. My cats are very fickle. They could have their own tv drama. I could film it!"
3855,Maybe you could film them cooking! That would be a cooking show to remember.
3856,I don't know a lot about the different dog breeds. But I did have a Dachshund as a child.
3856,well that is adorable ! we have a yorkie terrier mix !
3856,What is your dog's name?
3856,My dog's name is Rain or Ra for short :)
3856,I have 2 cats -- named Orange and Lemur
3856,Those are cute names! Do they travel with you?
3856,"No, they both hate getting into the car -- they think it's vet time. Does Rain like the car?"
3856,"Loves too, I have to try to sneak and to get away sometimes. I don't mind it. Makes a nice travel companion!"
3856,"I actually don't mind they don't want to travel. They are around me all the time, not like normal cats LOL"
3856,LOL! I hear that :) Love getting out for the exercise as well!
3856,We're actually having decent weather here to get outside and exercise. I'm enjoying it!
3856,me too ! trying to enjoy it while it lasts.
3857,"Well, I don't, either, so I'll have to wing it."
3857,It sounds like something that could be fun.  I enjoy dancing so learning a more formal style would be enjoyable.
3857,I think I was born with two left feet as far as dance goes.
3857,"I can understand that.  You said that you know a little ballroom dance, is there any kind of dancing you prefer?"
3857,Jitterbug is about all I know.
3857,I love dancing the jitterbug!  I had a friend teach me that in high school.  That was a long time ago.
3857,"My wife and I once won a dance contest, but I think all the judges were drunk."
3857,That's really great.  I haven't been in a dance contest before and probably not anytime soon.  We don't have as much time to go out these days.
3857,"Well, time flies when you're having fun. "
3857,"You've got that right!  We recently had a great vacation and, though we took a week, it seemed like it was over the day after it started."
3857,"Seems like all vacatikons end too soon, eh?"
3857,"They really do, it goes by so quickly."
3858,No. I didn't want to drive 45 minutes. I did my best to clean off with some water. 
3858,At least it was water and not coffee or juice
3858,"Yes, I didn't want it to ruin my time at the fair. I enjoy the food and rides. Do you like to go to the fair?"
3858,i like go to tour in hillstation.
3858, Good food and rides?
3858,yeah abosoultely..anything else.
3858,Always have to get a corny dog and a funnel cake.
3858,no no sometime i buy it.
3858,What is your favorite food at the fair?
3858,favourite food is pizza to eat at beach..
3858,I love the beach. And it doesn't matter if you spill your drink on yourself. You can just get in the water:)
3858,yeah i just add some water during drink.
3859,Don't you find dolls a little creepy?
3859,No! Why would they be creepy? They are beautiful.
3859,Probably have watched annabelle a few times too many!  Are your dolls expensive?
3859,"The dolls themselves, no. I like to dress them in Victorian clothes, so that can get pricey."
3859,"Wow, how do afford all that?"
3859,"Well, I really love antiques. I buy and sell them as a side hustle to fund my hobby with dolls."
3859,That's amazing.  I've always wanted to do freelance work. You find a lot of success hustling?
3859,It's a little like gambling. Sometimes I score big and sometimes I lose. I wouldn't recommend it as a day job!
3859,It's gotta be better than what my mom does!
3859,OMG what does she do?
3859,She's been a stay at home mom since before she conceived!  She relies 100% on my dad aha
3859,"Oh, I see. Your mom is an angel!"
3860,I especially like to throw in a bath bomb and just relax.
3860,"Exactly, a great bath with a bath bomb can be great, but not with a family. Kids can ruin a good bath"
3860,"Yes, much better when home alone, and no chance of being interrupted. "
3860,"Totally agree, so would you say you prefer a bath over a shower"
3860,"Yes, if I have the time.  How about you?"
3860,"Yes I prefer a bath over a shower but with my busy family life, i rarely get the chance to soak and relax in a bath anymore"
3860,I can understand that.  Lucky to grab a five minute uninterrupted shower. 
3860,"Sounds like my life, if i really want to relax in a bath im usually on vacation"
3860,Agree.  Or if I'm sick.  Have you ever done one of those float salt spas?
3860,No i have not but i definitely would look into it. Have you tried an float salt spas
3860,"Yes, once.  It was interesting.  Very serene and relaxing."
3860,I will have to try it out!
3861,That's okay. I can entertain you with stories about my dog.
3861,"Sure. What kind of food does your dog eat? Just so you know, I am very fascinated by food and what we as humans consume. "
3861,"Since I'm sure you won't tell his vet, his favorite food is Little Debbie Oatmeal Cream Pie"
3861,"Interesting. I must say, I've never heard of it before. Does he do any tricks? "
3861,He's still a puppy. Sitting for more than 5 seconds at a time is a challenge.
3861,"I understand. I will say now that we've been talking for some time, I am getting very hungry.  Food is always in my thoughts. "
3861,You sound like me. What's your favorite thing to eat?
3861,I love eating asian fusion food. I especially like eating curry ramen noodle soup. I ate some last night and it was extremely delicious. 
3861,"I love anything with curry in it. My mother passed away, but she used to make the best lamb curry."
3861,I'm truly sorry to hear that. I bet the lamb curry was superb. What is your favorite food dish if you had to choose?
3861,"I'm not hard to please. If you give me good macaroni and cheese, I'm happy."
3861,That is awesome. I am the same way as well. I enjoy Mediterranean foods like Greek Gyros or even Arab Naan bread with hummus. 
3862,I agree totally!  Do you have a favorite flower?
3862,"Yea, I like daisy's.  always bright and cheerful.  "
3862,Sweet! Do you have a favorite superhero?  I like to the Flash!
3862,"Hmmm,  I probably like Spiderman the most.  What do you like about the flash?"
3862,He's super fast and super smart.  I could only wish to have those qualities
3862,"Yea, and he was very witty.  Do you have other hobbies?  I play the drums"
3862,I like long walks in the summer.  Love reading and singing.
3862,I do love to read as well
3862,Awesome!  Do you have a favorite author or genre?
3862,"I just got done reading the James Comey book and starting to ready the Day Barkan Book, Eyes to the Wind."
3862,Oh wow that sounds really interesting!  I am more of a lover of fiction.  
3862,I do like fiction as well.  The Sparrow my Mary Doria Russell is highly recommended
3863,"I don't know, I guess it was my fault I trust in people"
3863,I'm sorry to hear about that.  I prefer boats to cars myself.
3863,"oh boats are really funny! but I don't know swim, so I prefer stay on ground!"
3863,"speaking of staying on the ground, I work at a hospital.  what about you?"
3863,"I am freelancer, I am electronic engineer"
3864,"The apples will be out on the trees too, I love apples."
3864,Apples are ok I guess....but I would feel weird just eating them off of random trees. My son loves them.
3864,"They're the best, the green ones are best"
3864,I prefer apple pie. Pair that with ice cream and Mario Kart and you've got yourself a partay.
3864,Oh yes with ice cream! thats amazing!
3864,My son tried to take an apple to school for his teacher. I told him people don't do that anymore lol. 
3864,Aren't you supposed to give them to doctors?
3864,"No, an apple a day is supposed to keep them away. Much like garlic to vampires I suppose..."
3864,"Oh yes, thats right. Stakes too, vampires don't like them much either so ive read!"
3864,I think stakes are meant for killing them more than keeping them away. But that's just in the video games I play lol
3864,Which games do you play?
3864,"Well, truth be told, the vampire ones are not my go-tos. I like Legend of Zelda, Paper Mario, Smash Bros, etc."
3865,So interesting. I love all music in general.
3865,"I enjoy music, too.  Do you play an instrument?"
3865,"I play the violin not, but played the flute in school. Also in the marching band."
3865,Being in the marching band is a lot of work--many hours of practice.  Good for you!
3865,OH ya. Those hot uniforms in south Texas are no joke.
3865,Our schools have started doing band practice in early morning and early evening.
3865,It is a lot of work for sure. I am a super fan of Lindsey Sterling. She is amazing on the Violin.
3865,She is really remarkable.  Did you see her on Dancing with the Stars last year?  Amazing!
3865,I missed that one. I haven't watched that show in a while. But she never disappoints.
3865,"To be honest, I had never heard of Lindsey Sterling before Dancing.  But I'm a fan now."
3865,"I can't remember how I found out about her, I think on Pandora. Never even thought I would be so into it."
3865,Have you been to one of her concerts?  I would think that would be spectacular.
3866,I always try to leave early enough to arrive 5-10 minutes before an appointment.
3866,"I can't relate haha, perhaps I would leave earlier if I was behind the wheel of a sweet porsche!"
3866,Getting a porsche is a goodgoal to have for yourself.
3866,"Yeah, it's my one true wish!  Do you have any major life goals, yourself?"
3866,I would like to retire early and rich.
3866,Good luck! - In this economy?  All I want is a porsche.
3866,A porsche is not cheap. Do you have a specific one in mind?
3866,"No, I'd be happy with just the badge to be honest!"
3866,A badge is a lot cheaper than the car. I like the porsche SUV.
3866,"true , they can be almost just as expensive haha.  How goes your music classes?"
3866,They are going well. I look forward to each class. I truely enjoy it.
3866,Very impressive!  Good luck with your music career!
3867,I have had to put her on a monthly limit!
3867,why limit her. kids feel ugly. maybe she is and this helps her feel good about herself. 
3867,"I get that, but it's expensive and I wish she would cultivate a hobby like mine - drawing."
3867,maybe your hobby is meaningless.  give her a break and let her have makeup. what if you were denied paint or markers for your hobby?
3867,This is intense conversation pre-coffee.... I just think the money is better spent on a hobby that she could enjoy. 
3867,so you get to define what she enjoys?  maybe makeup is her hobby. have a hit of caffeine and calm down. 
3867,There's no need to be rude about it. And my hobby isn't meaningless. I really excel at drawing.
3867,"bully for you. but meaningless for her. not rude, just candid that you are trying to define her interests and hobbies. rather selfishly."
3867,my daughter is 12.
3867,so what. she's still not you. she has her own interests and identity. stop trying to make her you. 
3867,You obviously don't have a daughter. You don't let 12 year olds run around in a ton of makeup.
3867,my daughter ran with makeup at 12. now she's an employed college grad & we are close because I let her be her.
3868,I have heard that. I would love to get a Border Collie but am unable to have a dog right now.
3868,One day you'll be able to. Just keep your head up!
3869,all the best and don't nervous on it.
3869,I'm nervous only because it's been a long time since I applied for a new job. I've been at the same company 13 years.
3869,ohh ok you can't expect anything you just try it and be bold.
3869,"I'm gonna try my best. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Do you work?"
3869,yeah i am working now at self employed.
3869,hopefully something you enjoy doing?
3869,now i am enjoy and fully involved my work.
3869,good attitude ! hard work pays off . What do you like to do for fun?
3869,thank you my dear new friend..more joking with friends..
3869,spending time with friends is always enjoyable. I don't get to see my best friend nearly enough.
3869,ok i understand your situation don't feel it.
3869,i'm used to it . my friends are ok with it as well .
3870,"I don't really follow Hockey, but I do go to games once in a while"
3870,i'm not much of a hockey fan . i went to one game .
3870,How about baseball - any interest?
3870,No. I am not very interested in most sports.
3870,where did you go to school?
3870,i was lucky to get into an entry level job and work my way up. but i didn't go to school.
3870,What kind of work do you do?  I do consulting work
3870,i work in international marketing. i provide copy to international businesses.
3870,"That sounds interesting. I know you can't talk about business, but anything you think I might recognize?"
3870,i doubt it. most of the companies i deal with do not have any bases in the united states yet. but they want to.
3870,Most of my consulting work is focused on HR process improvement and leadership training
3870,does any of your consulting work ever deal with international companies?
3870,done
3871,No.  I was too terrified!
3871,"I would be too.  I'm happy you didnt get into an accident or even worse, killed!"
3871,"It seems like something scary happens nearly every day.  Last week, a driver ran a red light and crashed into my friend's fender."
3872,"Well, I just meant I am not a girl. I am a boy. What do you like then?"
3872,scouts are good. but i like safety patrol.
3872,Safety patrol? Like a crossing guard?
3872,no. go around school and make sure everyone's chill
3872,"school?? Man, I can't take school. Dropped out. I'm into my music."
3872,what kind of music? i hate baby shark...
3872,Baby shark blows. I like Tool.
3872,yeah. at least in school you can hang out with friends easy
3872,"What grade are you in, little dude?"
3872,4th. we got a cool robots club going. 
3872,Nice! You into robots?
3872,yeah. i want to do first lego league stuff. 
3873,That is so gross.  Just think about all the things they end up touching.
3873,Plus think about all the germs and diseases that are spread around. I totally agree with you!
3873,"I dread going to the stores and restaurants during cold and flu season, for that very reason."
3873,Me too!  It never hurts to take a few extra minutes to wash your hands at least for 30 seconds.
3873,I wish everyone would do that.  We would get sick less often and miss less work. 
3873,"Speaking of work, that's why I am very careful when a co worker brings in food. "
3873,Are you afraid they didn't wash their hands while preparing it?
3873,One time a lady used the bathroom and left without washing her hands and the next day brought in brownies.
3873,Ewww.  I would not be eating those brownies!  Did you tell people?
3873,"Everybody I could, but she was in another department.  Pretty gross huh?"
3873,"Really gross.  Sometimes I wish people brought food into my work, but not after hearing stories like that!"
3873,"Oh yeah, please"
3874,I will be on Vacation so I am going to beach!
3874,Sounds good. I like going to the beach.
3874,what do yo prefer beach or mountain?
3874,I like both. I love Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado but the beach is great also.
3874,and Do you have any hobby? I like to write poetry
3874,"I love reading, both fiction and non-fiction."
3874,nice! and movie ? did you see the joker?
3874,"No, I haven't seen the Joker but have heard a lot about it. I lot of people have seen it. I's very popular."
3874,"Yes, I have heard a lot too, people say is a good movie! what kind of movie do you like?"
3874,"I like action movies a lot, especially war movies like Saving Pvt. Ryan."
3874,that was a good movie too
3874,Have you done Karaoke singing? It's a lot of fun.
3875,I'd think that the movie industry and video games are where the real money's at.
3875,"Yeah, but those are kind of hit and miss. There are always companies wanting to advertise, but movies and games kind of come and go."
3875,"Yeah, they are kind of episodic, they are discrete programs that eventually end."
3875,What about you? What do you do?
3875,I'm from Algeria and am at University studying Comp Sci.
3875,That sounds intelligent...and makes me feel inadequate lol. I like reading. That's about all I can offer lol.
3875,"Yeah, but I'm not good at socializing, so it's a trade-off.  You'll probably have a better life than me in the end."
3875,Meh. Socializing is a skill that can easily be learned. Just go where people are and observe if you have to. You will be fine!
3875,"Yeah, but it's not natural to me, so it feels like I'm faking it."
3875,"If you practice enough, it will become natural"
3875,"I hope so!  I like to spent time alone hiking in the mountains, maybe I should join a hiking group."
3875,There you go! There's less time for socializing when everyone's huffing and puffing too haha. Which mountains do you hike?
3875,I like to go out to Rocky mountain National Park.
3876,"Thankfully, I didn't obtain in serious injuries. Mostly shocked and became frustrated later :("
3876,That's good no serious injuries were sustained. I took a hike in Zion National Park and twisted my ankle. That was not pretty. 
3876,"Yikes, I bet that did not feel good. Thankfully, you're okay now. At least I hope :)"
3876,"I am okay, thank you for asking. I have visited 12 national parks in the U.S. and that has never happened. Quite the surprise."
3876,That's awesome! So which park would you say is your favorite at this time?
3876,"I would say at this time, The Grand Canyon has been the best experience. The feeling of being next to a natural marvel is really overwhelming. "
3876,"Oh that sounds interesting. Out of all of the ones that you have visited, which one would you like traveling to again?"
3876,"I would say I would travel to Zion National Park again. I love hiking, and the trail of Angel's Landing Point is truly a challenging and rewarding one."
3876,"Well, honestly I don't know much about National parks, but I would like to visit the Grand Canyon, since it is one of the most popular ones."
3876,You definitely should. The Gran Teton Mountains comes as a close second. It looks like Mordor from Lord of the Rings.  
3876,"Oh, so you are a Lord of the Rings fan? Cool. It was okay. A bit over-rated though."
3876,I can see it as being overly acclaimed. I would also recommend you hike Bryce Canyon as that park is more scenic than Zion and less rigorous.
3877,I left a candle burning while I was at work. I feel awful and cannot believe I did that.
3877,My goodness! How scary! Was anyone hurt?
3877,Thankfully no one was home.
3877,I'm glad no one was hurt! I would have been devastated to lose all of my personal paintings.
3877,Are you an artist?
3877,I am! I love to paint and I love singing as well. Do you like art?
3878,I like to travel and explore the wilderness.
3878,"same here, there's nothing like the great outdoors"
3878,"Yes indeed, show me a mountain and I'm happy."
3878,"We used to live near Yellowstone National Park, in Wyoming. Beautiful country up crisp clean air"
3878,It's very beautiful there and up in Montana.
3878,"I enjoy fly fishing in a cool mountain stream, and then cooking my catch beside the fire that night. It does not hurt to have a beer also"
3878,"Fresh campfire cooked trout is the best, and yes with cold beverage or two."
3878,Do you also hunt? I miss being able to go elk hunting
3878,I do not hunt but I do see a lot of wildlife on the trail.
3878,"It's also nice to nature watch. there are so many more species to see if you just stop, look, and listen"
3878,"There's nothing better than a peaceful backpacking trip in the mountains, so much to see and experience."
3878,I have always dreamt of hiking the appalacian trail.  
3878,I have hiked a few sections and want to do more when I have the time. 
3878,"that's cool, have you read bill Bryson's book A Walk In the Woods? A very good read. I also believe is a movie now."
3878,"I have seen the movie with Robert Redford, good film. Nice chatting, see ya."
3879,"Yeah, me too...I'd rather fly."
3879,living for the days of robot cars. got to be safer than people driving.
3879,"But when the AI takes over, we're all doomed."
3879,nah. ai won't be as selfish as people are. we can program it out.  
3879,"Remember SkyNet? Yeah, that'll do it."
3879,"lol. if humanity doesn't gene edit or program out its selfishness, we will cause our own extinction. "
3879,I don't think that will be possible. We're doomed.
3879,no. there's a possibility because some humans choose to be self less. if we can get them in charge of programming ai we stand a chance. 
3879,But who watches the programers? Other programers?
3879,"has to be a core of people who choose altruism over self interest.  difficult, but not impossible. "
3879,"Well, I don't think we can wait and see, right?"
3879,who knows. but at least we have music and the backstreet boys while the battle rages!
3880,I've really been trying to improve my Butterfly Stroke - not an easy one.
3880,That is one of the hardest to master.  But can be done with hard work. 
3880,Yeah... I've just got too chop in the water. 
3880,It takes practice for sure.  Really the more experience you have the better you get.
3880,"Kind of like sewing. I really enjoy that as well, but it takes a lot of practice."
3880,I don't like to sew.
3880,Why not... it's such a useful skill!
3880,I don't feel like I have much use for it.
3880,I like to alter my clothes.
3880,I don't have any problems with clothes bought right off the rack.
3880,I see... I like to personalize them.
3880,I am not that creative.
3881,There is a new romance movie set in Europe that looks cute. I might see that.
3881,I don't keep up with many of the new movies coming out. I am more interested in music than movies.
3881,I'm interested in a lot of things from Europe. I've never been but I want to go there some day.
3881,I've been to Europe a couple of times. Is there a particular country you want to visit?
3881,France would be nice to visit. Do you know of any European bands?
3881,not too many modern days ones. Do you have any suggestions?
3881,Keane is a Brit-pop band that just came out with a new album that is good. Maybe I should visit the UK?
3881,I'd heard of them before. I didn't realize the band was back together again!
3881,Yes they just got back together. I was very excited.
3881,"I haven't been to the UK, but have visited Ireland. It was pretty and nice weather even in late October."
3881,I can only imagine how beautiful it is. My Mom's dream destination is Ireland.
3881,"If you do get there, don't miss going into Northern Ireland.  And the Cliffs of Moher are outstanding."
3882,"nope, I just ate it - I like to live dangerously.  "
3882,"I've read that food is OK for a few days past the expiration date, so I think you'll be OK."
3882,"Oh, so not living as dangerously as I thought - mediocre risk taker I guess.  I planning a europe trip.  any recommendations"
3882,"I loved Ireland.  Beautiful countryside, quaint villages, lots to see and do."
3882,"I've done england, but never ireland - loved the english country side.  A friend suggested a river boat cruise "
3882,"I have a friend who just got back from a river boat cruise.  It was her favorite cruise ever, and she goes on a lot. "
3882,cool  where else in europe have you been?
3882,"Only Ireland, so far, but have also been to lots of Caribbean islands, Hawaii, Alaska, Canada.  Next on my list is Scotland."
3882,sounds fun!   how long were you in ireland - how much time do you think I should plan?
3882,"I've spent about six weeks there in total.  I'd say to spend two weeks, if possible.  I love the bed & breakfasts."
3882,6 weeks!  wow - how did you manage to be able to spend so much time?
3882,"It was two weeks over three different summers, helping a friend with a research study."
3883,That's awesome. Is it a lot of work?
3883,Sometimes worse than others. You should see when it snows. Crazy.
3883,Really? Not much snow where I live in Kentucky.
3883,"Oh, Michigan is much worse."
3883,"That's what my boyfriend was saying the other day, actually. Super weird coincidence."
3883,"First thing to run out is bottled water, then dehydrated stuff."
3883,Dehydrated stuff? I thought everyone bought bread and milk. Which is confusing. Why not wine and steak?
3883,"Yeah, why not? I mean, oatmeal? Really?"
3883,"Right? If I am going to be snowed in with my sweet fiance, I want to be living it up!"
3883,"Yeah, give me a good strip, and a keg of wine."
3883,Now you are talking my language!
3883,"Can't leave out vodka, right?"
3884,"I ended up sitting alone for the first week, but then started to make some friends in english class."
3884,That's good to hear. I know it can be hard going to a new school.
3884,"Yeah, my family was in the military so we moved around a lot."
3884,My dad was in the military also. We moved a lot. I went to 7 different schools.
3884,"Wow, that is crazy.  It is always hard starting out fresh.  How did it go for you?"
3884,It went pretty well. I knew we would move a lot and I just tried to make the best of it.
3884,"That is all you can do.  I teach school now, and try to help those kids i see in similar situations."
3884,That's great! Do you like teaching?
3884,"I love it.  Seeing the kids grasp a concept, and the looks on their faces when something makes sense is amazing."
3884,I did some teaching also. College adult students. I enjoyed it.
3884,"Oh wow, what subject did you teach?  I teach elementary, so a little bit of everything."
3884,I taught computer courses. 
3885,Yeah. He was at home. Apparently he was being bullied and stayed home instead of going to school.
3885,I'm sorry to hear that. It is sad that people will use force or threats to bully other students.
3885,I remember being bullied as a kid. I ended up taking self defense classes.
3885,There was a bully who picked on my brother as he came home from school it was bad he would cry
3885,That is really sad. Hopefully the bully stopped eventually.
3885,police eventually arrested him before anything major
3885,That's good. Talking about school reminded me that I need to talk to a college adviser. I've been thinking about going back to school.
3886,I think that would be perfect! We could dress as characters from Harry Potter too!
3886,fun. i love makeup so we have to do some makeup on voldemort character!
3886,That would be epic! Could you imagine being dressed as Voldemort and doing martial arts! It would attract some interesting people
3886,omg. who else could we makeup - hermione could use some updating too.
3886,"Yes she could, maybe a sassy Hermione doing karate"
3886,or lucy for harry. we could make that scar awesome and more ninja like. dress harry in black...
3886,and give him ninja stars!
3886,love it. this would probably be my most popular youtube video ever!
3886,I think it would most definitely go to trending!
3886,what videos do you like to watch on youtube?
3886,"I mostly like to watch nerdy stuff, like gaming and game news channels. How about you?"
3886,"makeovers, makeup, and I watch Ru Paul's Drag Race for makeup examples. those girls are amazing. "
3887,"They had a lot of problems in the area of mechanical reliability, but they're retro cool!"
3887,"yeah, Vinyls are slowly making a comeback i think to... "
3887,Yeah they're cool too!  I can't afford any new hobbies as my watch addiction is consuming all my excess income now.
3887,Ahahah i dont know anything about watches! some are up there in price though!
3887,Yeah!  I collect Soviet-era watches from 1918-1989.
3887,Oof! Thats pretty nifty! The oldest thing i have is a 1914 Penny! Thats one cool hobbie!
3887,The Commies made a really broad ranges of watches for a command economy.
3887,Yeah.. Never would have expected them to be into making watches!
3887,"They were constantly struggling to produce precision products, I'm currently into pilot/cosmonaut watches."
3887,Ah! I collect coins... I don't have many... oh and containers! Like old vintage metal ones lol
3887,"Yeah! Plastic is really useful, but it has no soul.  Metal containers are much cooler!"
3887,"And they are pretty cool! A few have rust but, they look marvelous! I have alot of coca-cola ones "
3887,That'd be a good hobby!
3888,Wow I bet you have very exciting days at work?
3888,Most are very exciting
3888,Do you have more good or bad days in the emergency room?
3888,"good days, they go by fast. I try to leave work at work and distract myself with outside life"
3888,I understand. I try to do the same. I am an IT Director. Not as exciting as your job though.
3888,"That's awesome, great field. "
3888,Yes I work for a major Entertainment company. 
3888,Oooh exciting. Sounds like fun
3888,"Yes some days are fun, but some can be boring. But I still love my job. Do you love your job?"
3888,"Yes I do, but my real passion is the piano. "
3888,Cool you play the piano too. What type of music do you play?
3888,Mostly classical. I am buying one for my new house. It will be my oasis
3889,"Oh that sounds really cool, what's your favorite song to have them perform?"
3889,That has to be Handel's MESSIAH at Christmastime--so powerful.
3889,"I LOVE Christmas, maybe it's because I loved getting gifts from my siblings, or maybe it was seeing their faces. But that's pretty cool"
3889,Can you believe there are only eight weeks until Christmas?  
3889,I know right! I can't wait until I get to see the snow on the ground. But we have to get through Thanksgiving and Halloween first!
3889,"You're right, but all of our stores are full of Christmas trees right now!"
3889,"Yeah, you know stores, they'll stock everything up with Christmas decorations by early October. Speaking of which, are you doing anything for Halloween?"
3889,"I'm going to a costume party at a friend's house.  He has one every year, and it's lots of fun."
3889,"Ooh, that does sound like fun. I won't be going to a party, but I'll have family for Thanksgiving!"
3889,Wonderful!  Will you be doing all the cooking?  I love Thanksgiving food!
3889,"I'll definitely be helping out with the cooking, but I'll have help from my 3 siblings."
3889,It sounds like fun.  Turkey and all the trimmings?
3890,It was a travel book about Ireland. My mother was born there and I would quite like to visit someday.
3890,I love Ireland and would love to go one day.
3890,"I have been to Australia, but I have never been north."
3890,"Australia seems like an incredible place to visit, but they seem to have a lot of scary bugs. Did you have any issues while there?"
3890,"Not really. But I was only in Sydney and in the Blue Mountains. If I had seen one of those giant spider, I would have died."
3890,"Oh, me too! Spiders are the worst."
3890,I completely agree. But fear of local wildlife is not enough to keep me from traveling. I want to see as much as I can!
3890,Did you try a lot of local foods while you were there? I am more of a fast food type.
3890,I had Tim Tams and Turkish Delight. But I don't know what else is strictly Australian cuisine-wise. Or if Turkish delight is English...
3890,I am not sure. You always hear stories about people eating emu and stuff.
3890,That may be true...I had no such experience. But I did go to a super authentic Mandarin restaurant in Sydney.
3890,I love Mandarin food. It's about all I eat outside of fast food.
3891,no what ghosts?
3891,I dunno... shelters seem a little creepy to me. 
3891,Why are they creepy? The animals are so cute and cuddly
3891,Yeah but what about all the animals who are euthanized? Creeps. It's like the holidays... creepy.
3891,"I can see your point on the shelters. Other then halloween, how are holidays creepy?"
3891,Just a lot of sad energy? Ya know?
3891,No. Not really. I love spending holidays with my two children.
3891,Oh... you've got two kids eh? Me? None... but my car is kinda like my kid.
3891,Cars are cool. Classic cars are very cool.
3891,I've got a convertible.
3891,i'd be too afraid of random thunderstorms.
3891,It's not biggie. You pull over and push a button. Done.
3892,Fishing - that sounds fun.  I like spending time outdoors
3892,"Yep as long as the weather is nice, it's fun. It's too hot right now though"
3892,too hot?  Where I live it's cold.  still have to wear a hat due to the sun and my bald head.
3892,"oh i'm so sorry , and i'm here worried about being bald ."
3892,haha - no worries.  Ever run into anyone famous?
3892,"no , i just think one day i'll be famous and rich ahah what yabout yourself?"
3892,rich and famous - go for it.  Probably never be either - but still happy
3892,no harm in trying. always aim high and you never know what you will achieve!
3892,good attitude - what makes you so happy?
3892,knowing that if i achieve my goals then me and my family will be a lot better of than we are currently. so looking to the future
3892,sounds like smart thinking.  family is very important to you.  What do you like about your family
3892,they have always been there for me nd thats something thats priesless. 
3893,I'm so sorry for your loss. What is your cat's name?
3893,My cats name is luna.  How about yours?
3893,"Pretty name! I had 3 cats, but just lost one to cancer. The 2 I have left are named Orange and Lemur"
3893,Sorry to hear about your cat.  Experiencing loss is hard whether it is a human or fur baby. 
3893,thank you. But I try to focus on the good times and hope he's not suffering now. 
3893,That is a good attitude to have.  I try to remind myself that all of the time. But it is still hard sometimes. 
3893,oh it's exceedingly hard to keep in mind. How old is your sweet Luna?
3893,She is three and a half. Hopefully I will still have along time with her. 
3893,I'm sure you will! My 2 are between 10-13. I've had cats live as long as 22 human years.
3893,"I hope so,  I don't want to have to experience another loss for quite some time. "
3893,Very true. It feels like a piece of your heart has been physically carved out of your body.
3893,That describes it exactly. So sad.
3893,I turned to my cats when I lost my parents unexpectedly 3 months apart from each other. 
3893,"I can sympathize. losing one parent is hard enough, but both is unbearable."
3893,"You know it's inevitable, but the not knowing when & how is what hurts the worst."
3893,"Exactly, especially when it is so unexpected "
3894,"I'm not a huge fan of it, I hate how much it get stuck in my teeth"
3894,Yeah Broccoli is not the best. I much more prefer something a little more starchy 
3894,I'm a police office so you can sure that there's enough starchy donuts for everyone!
3895,Indeed. Speaking of rate of return: I'm a hopeless romantic. I feel that I give too much and receive too little in the game of love.
3895,"I'd say always keep your heart protected, but still be open to new experiences. Romance only has as much power as you give it!"
3895,You may be right. It's something I might need to stay away from a while for my own good. I'm distracting myself by collecting antiques.
3895,"I used to collect too when I was a kid, I still have some but they are probably worth nothing other than nostalgia."
3895,Sometimes that nostalgia is what reminds me that I can still feel again. Maybe that's why I like them so much. 
3895,"It's valid to find self-worth in your own accomplishments, even if it's just collecting antiques. You're the master of you."
3895,"Interesting existential viewpoint. Romanticism, Nihilism, all just thoughts redirected at identifying the self. Who are we really comes down to what we do. "
3895,"We as humans were given the power to think and examine our own feelings, and thus the power to understand and overcome ourselves! I think that's amazing."
3895,"Agreed. I think its too easy to dwell on the negative and victimize our own situation. Many paths, but at least we have the luxury of choosing."
3895,We are truly animals unlike any other. Lives filled with choice instead of a fixed fate. Always motivated for change.
3895,Good luck with this life my friend. I'll continue to find a little more love in the particles of these lovely antiques. 
3895,And good luck to you! May your happiness be ever expanding :)
3896,How embarrassing for me to work in a florists and not know what a Narcissus is!
3896,Apparently the narcissus word comes from the Green word for intoxicated (narcotic). But the flowers don't actually have that effect on people.
3896,The green word? I would hope that they don't make people drunk!
3896,No they don't make people drunk. But some flowers like dandelions can be used in wines.
3896,"Yeah, I have some old wine-making books that say you can use dandelions. "
3896,I like to grow a variety of flowers in my garden to use in my kitchen. Some like the narcissus are just for looks though.
3896,"All the flowers I grow are for looks, guess that's just part of my job!"
3896,I suppose that is true! Do you sell other things too?
3896,"Mainly flowers but we also sell accessories, things like vases and miniature watering cans for the house plants. We're thinking about getting into floral scented candles. "
3896,That sounds awesome! I will have to stop by and take a look at your shop.
3896,That sounds great!
3896,Do you get much business in your shop?
3897,Wow! That is huge! I wish I was taller so I could clean taller places.
3897,How tall are you then?
3897,Only 5 feet and 6 inches...not short for a lady but not as tall as you!
3897,"That's the same height as my girlfriend! I think it's pretty average! I feel way too tall sometimes, hahah. It makes cleaning difficult after a while with the bending."
3897,Well you can always team up with your girlfriend! She takes low you take high haha. Sounds like a movie.
3897,"I wish that would actually work, I'm left to the cleaning most of the time"
3897,That's to bad. Does she work longer hours than you?
3897,All the time. She doesn't get home until late but I do small stuff while she's gone since my schedule works a lot differently.
3897,That can be stressful. I am home all the time so my husband does not have to be worried about that!
3897,That's good to hear you guys communicate that well and have a mutual agreement. What does your husband do?
3897,Civil Engineer. He often gets home late so I end up having a lot of free time!
3897,Sounds like a very invested job to get in to. Does he like it?
3898,I enjoy watching football and hiking. What about you?
3898,oh thats nice i enjoy reading novels and xploring new areas. 
3898,Those are both interesting. What is your favorite food? I really like spaghetti and meatballs. 
3899,Are you sure?
3899,"not really. i prefer movies, like star wars. what about you?"
3899,I prefer family oriented films but i have a different view of rally racing
3899,"yeah, everybody likes different things.  I work at mcdonald's and some people like strange combinations"
3899,"Interesting comparsion, well do you like off roading?"
3899,only been once. it was a fun day. seems a little dangerous though to do it a lot. 
3899,i believe rally racing is similar but involves motorsports but i will have to do more research
3899,"do you remember the movie ""the great car race"" from growing up? i think it was about something similar."
3899,"Sorry I am not famaliar with film "" The Great Car Race"" I will have to look it up. Was it a good movie?"
3899,"yeah. although I have to confess I enjoyed watching chitty chitty bang bang as a kid. now as adults we're talking about drones and flying cars, lol. "
3899,"Good old memories, well i guess i challenge us to figure out what rally racing really is and go out and explore"
3899,maybe something like this https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059243/
3900,They always complain when I play my piano.
3900,You play? Brah-vo.. I like to paint.
3900,I have only played for a few years. What kind of pictures do you paint?
3900,Use the mute peddle. It will make it super soft. 
3900,"I don't play late at night or early in the morning, they can just deal with it."
3900,"I see.... I typically do water on paper, and I paint nature."
3900,That is cool. I wish I could paint or draw.
3900,Just start! It's all about what speaks to you.
3900,"I have read that the more you practice, the more you can improve. You may never be a great artist, but you can see improvement."
3900,Absolutely. Or take a class! It's a great way to decorate on a budget.
3900,I think I would probably focus on abstract art :)
3900,There is merit to that too!
3901,have you ever talked to them about their comics?
3901,No I have not. But yes I do go to Comic Con. Do you have fun when you go?
3901,"sometimes I do, but it can get a bit hectic if a popular creator is there."
3901,Yes the big crowds can be a hassle. Do you go to other types of conferences too?
3901,"I have gone to a collectors con before, but just to look around"
3901,That is cool too. What else do you do with your free time?
3901,"I enjoy reading, playing games, and listening to music. what about you?"
3901,Reading not so much but I love video games. What are your favorite video games?
3901,I like jrpg games. They always have new elements and odd story lines. What are yours?
3901,I like sports games like the NBA Experience or Madden Football. Do you play those?
3901,"I used to play NHL games, but I was never into football or basketball"
3901,"I played NHL games too, but not the most fun for me. What do you read mostly?"
3902,"I know it's all for fun! I also love singing to myself at home, it's very calming to the mind."
3902,"There a cook Karoke app for the iPhone, that way you can do it anywhere not just a bar."
3902,"That would be nice, maybe I can do rap songs as I've been told I can sing very fast."
3902,"""there a cook"" lol Rap is sometimes super-complex lyrics, I'm a secret fan!"
3902,"It's a guilty pleasure for sure, it doesn't really fit with my friends."
3902,"You, Me the same.  Rick and Morty is my true secret pleasure!"
3902,Adult Swim is the greatest center for late night binging for sure!
3902,"Yeah!  The best animated series operate at multiple levels, so adults and kids can enjoy at the same time, like the Simpsons."
3902,There were too many jokes I didn't understand when I watched Simpsons as a kid.
3902,"Yeah, that allows for the whole family to watch together!"
3902,My parents used to snicker when we watched the Simpson and I didn't know why!
3902,"Yeah, that show's humor has a lot of depth!"
3903,My teammates abandoned me :( They all left the game.
3903,wow! too bad. do you like any other online video games?
3903,Hmm. I like playing Final Fantasy 14 currently. Do you play any?
3903,oh nice i havent played that yet. curently i play a lot o league of legends. been gaming all my life ahah 
3903,"Oh same, I just got back into it again. Do you play ranked?"
3903,yes i play ranked ahah recently got to gold but now im taking the time to get my flex rank up to gold also
3903,I just got to gold recently too! I'm up for promos into gold III currently and I've got one free win. I started in B2 this season lol.
3903,That's pretty awesome keep grinding
3903,"Thanks. I've been playing since Xerath came at, so a long time. I've quit the game and come back again numerous times. You?"
3903,lots of zac jgl ahah
3903,Neat. I main jungler as well. Mostly Vi and Voli.
3903,nice i used to play lot of vi!
3904,That does sound really good! Have you ever tried sausage and green peppers! Its amazing
3904,"I've never tried sausage on a pizza, is that your favourite topping?"
3904,My favorite topping is definitely pepperoni but that combo is my favorite]
3904,Sounds tasty! I don't think there's a topping that will ever come close to pepperoni for me though.
3904,this is true! It is a classic! What do you like to do for fun?
3904,"I mainly like to go to the bar with my buds, what about you?"
3904,"I really like to go to the gym, it gives me so much energy!"
3904,"Thats so true, I love to hit the gym"
3904,"I also like animals and wish I could help, its a goal"
3904,"That's really sweet of you, I love animals too"
3904,I feel like there is so much more we could all do to help. What do you do for a living?
3904,"right now I stay at home to look after my kids, what about you?"
3905,It was a pug.
3905,"Aww, I love pugs. Their wrinkly, short-muzzled faces and curled tails are so cute."
3905,I know. I think a pug would do great with my cats as well. 
3905,Can't dispute that. Is it really true that cats have nine lives?
3905,I can't dispute that.  My cats have had their share of mischief. 
3905,I guess what they say is true - cats do have nine lives.
3905,Do you own any animals?
3905,"I do, a cat! She's been great companionship during the cancer treatments."
3905,I bet she is.  Pets are great like that.  Sometimes better than humans!
3905,There is no doubt about that.
3905,Sorry to hear about the cancer though.  I survived melanoma.  So I understand needing the companionship. 
3905,"That's great to hear you survived, my wife currently has cancer."
3905,"Sorry to hear that, what type of cancer does she have?"
3905,It's terminal cancer.
3905,So very sorry to hear that.  Sending prayers and positive thoughts your way!
3905,"Thank you, I appreciate your positive thoughts."
3906,"It is quite enjoyable, but I find it hard after I have enjoyed large meals. "
3906,"I hear you there. Personally, i like to wait a good 20-30 minutes after i eat before i swim"
3906,"That is a very good idea. Where I am from, it is too cold to swim now. What activities do you enjoy?"
3906,"I like lots of activities. I play basketball for a living, so that. But i also like golf, fishing, hunting...basically anything outdoors."
3906,"That is really neat that you are a professional athlete. I also enjoy the outdoors, mostly hiking. "
3906,I love hiking. Just did a trip in Colorado last month. Hiked the Continental Divide. Where do you like to hike?
3906,"I have never visited CO, but it looks beautiful. My favorite hiking trip has to be through the state parks in Ireland. "
3906,Ah Ireland. Beautiful country.
3906,"It definitely is. I am from America and really enjoy the scenic destinations we have here, but being abroad is wonderful. "
3906,"I hear you, there. Have you ever been to Italy? We backpacked through the Italian Alps a few years ago. GORGEOUS"
3906,"I have! Last year I went on a school trip to Germany, Italy, and Switzerland. It was amazing. I would love to backpack through the Italian Alps. Lucky you."
3906,I'd love to ski them sometime. Do you ski?
3907,What type of sport does the Ultimate brand focus on
3907,Ultimate is a frisbee game. It has grown very popular since 1968.
3907,Interesting i never looked at frisbee as an organized sport
3907,"Yes it started as casual activity, but now has grown to the point it is being considered for the 2024 Summer Olympics."
3907,"That is amazing, do you know if the USA would have an frisbee respresenting team"
3907,"I'm not sure, they probably do, but the coolest thing about Ultimate is that there are no referees. The whole game is self-officiating."
3907,So how do an individual join Ultimate
3907,"I think you can sign up online and see if there is one near you, a lot of them have their own facebook groups."
3907,"ok will do, are you an interested in joining Ultimate?"
3907,"Yes I play Ultimate, at Columbia uni having a blast !"
3907,Is there an membership fee to join Ultimate
3907,"It's free, so you can just show up and play."
3908,"Yeah, it's a great way for me to relax even though it's so boring. Exercising just make you feels better in general"
3908,"yeah. with my short hair, i can run, shower and be back at work pretty quick and look good in the afternoon if i run at lunch, lol"
3908,That's nice. My two nephews said the same thing. I have long hair so it requires much more work :) 
3908,"bun, french twist, ponytail work too!  I remember running with my dad as a kid. good memories now that he's gone. who do you run with?"
3908,I usually run with my mom since she need a buddy to motivate her to workout. 
3908,"what a great way to spend time together. hope you go for a coffee and shared treat afterward, lol :)"
3908,"Yeah lol. What about you, do you run with anyone? "
3908,my dog runs on a treadmill next to mine so we work out together!
3908,That's adorable. What
3908,he was scared as a puppy but then he caught on. border collies need tons of exercise. this works for both of us!
3908,"Sorry, I typed enter before I could finish. He sounds super cute, I'm considering getting a dog to spend time together like you and your dog :D"
3908,"some breeds like border collie, shepherd, standard poodle are super smart and easily trained on a treadmill"
3909,I like to cook and am also interested in the history of food.
3909,ohhhh okay that makes more sense. I love to cook beef stews!
3909,I used to work as a nurse and I would make beef stew in the crockpot so it would be ready when I got home.
3909,That's cool. I have worked in a hospital as a nurse before.
3909,Were you an RN or an LPN?
3909,I was an LPN. I was working so hard for my patients!
3909,LPNs do not always get the recognition they deserve.
3909,I know. You sound like you are familiar with LPN works.
3909,"I was an RN, but my best friend was a LPN before she left the field."
3909,"I was trying to study the RN field, but it was too hard and I wasn't smart enough. haha"
3909,"I am sure you were. But, it is definitely a lot to learn and remember."
3909,I may have to give it a shot again. I now know a lot about how this medical field works.
3909,You should try again.
3910,How long did your dad drive for?
3910,"He drove since he was young, probably about 50 years altogether"
3910,Wow! How many states did he cover on his journeys?
3910,"I'm pretty sure he has driven through most of the US, I wish I had asked him"
3910,"That's amazing! The only state I haven't visited is Alaska, I really hope to go there one day... did your dad ever go there?"
3910,"Yeah hes been to Alaska, I haven't though. I would like to go too."
3910,Yeah I hear the summers there are the best!
3910,"Yeah, me too! I would love to go camping there. "
3910,That sounds like a great time! There's this lake there that I've always wanted to swim in.
3910,You should make the trip! Are there any lakes nearby that would be easier for you to make it to?
3910,"I'm not too sure, that's just always been kind of a bucket list thing of mine to do."
3910,Do you have anything else exciting on your bucket list?
3911,It was amazing. It helped me so much with team playing at work. I would definitely recommend it!
3911,Glad to hear it! What kind of team activities did you do?
3911,We played so many fun games like Wet Shirt Relay and Human Pinball Machine. But in the evenings it was super relaxed and we listened to 80s music all evening.
3911,"Sounds like fun! They have signups for camps near the beach I visit a lot, maybe I could take part in one."
3911,I wold definitely recommend it! Maybe you could do one through work? I'm a wedding planner so team building exercises like that are encouraged.
3911,I'm out of work right now but I did used to work for a cable company! Maybe better teamwork would have kept me there longer haha.
3911,"Ahah, team work isn't always for everyone! Have you considered another career path?"
3911,"I guess I always had a feeling I couldn't be in cable forever, but I never put much thought into it. Was wedding planning your first choice?"
3911,It was. I've always loved interacting with customers and making their day special.
3911,I'm sure they appreciate your enthusiasm for them! Maybe I'll find a career where I can make someone feel truly happy too.
3911,I hope you do
3911,Thank you! I appreciate that. I really hope my time out of work leads me to the right path.
3912,Most of them do.  Although I love my truck and it has lasted forever too. 
3912,They are one of the most reliable cars on the market.
3912,My f-150 runs great.  What kind of car/truck do you drive?
3912,I had a Ford Edge. This one is somewhere in between the Honda Fit and Accord.
3912,"I drive a ford as well, although mine is a truck.  I bet you get better gas mileage. "
3912,"Haha I definitely get better gas mileage. Small, compact car. I believe it is only a 4 cylinder too."
3912,"My truck can guzzle the gas, but I love it anyway.  I have a lot of room to haul. "
3912,That's the nice part about a truck. Plenty of room. Terrible gas mileage.
3912,"Exactly, luckily I don't have to drive too far on a day to day basis. "
3912,Do you work close to home? 
3912,"Yes, only about five miles. How about you?"
3912,I drive about an hour. I am a pilot and must drive to the airport. Need good gas mileage. 
3912,"Yes, with an hour drive I would say so!"
3913,Oh wow I didn't know reusable diapers existed. That most help a tooon.
3913,they do ! but they're so worth it ! They are the cloth diapers. Its work but saves a lot of money
3913,"Oh yeah, I"
3913,So are you in school? work?
3913,"Sorry, I meant to finish that last sentence. I am working full-time as a massage therapist."
3913,Oh wow thats awesome! Seems like a pretty chill job
3913,"It definitely is. It can be a lot of work on our bodies too, some people burn out and have to find something else to do."
3913,Im sure its a balancing act. I have to imagine your hands cramp up from trying to uncramp other people lol
3913,"Hahah, sometimes it's like that. It's all in good body mechanics though which is learned through experience. I also rock climb to help my strength."
3913,You must be pretty strong to do that.
3913,"You don't have to be. Lot's of people, especially kids do well since they weight so little. Arm and leg span can make a big difference sometimes."
3913,i bet . i do not think i would ever be able to do that .
3914,"No, I am a lawyer and avoid the ocean."
3914,"oh, well I'm in the navy so the ocean is pretty much my second home."
3914,That is good.     Have you been in combat?
3914,"No, I do research mostly"
3914,That is good.     So you stay away from more dangerous situations!
3914,Pretty much. If i wanted the danger id be a marine.
3914,What kind of research do you do?
3914,We survey and map the ocean
3914,That sounds like fun.     The ocean is much more wonderful than many people believe.
3914,It is. You said you're a lawyer. What kind? 
3914,Constitutional law.    I hope to work in the federal court system soon.
3914,Sounds difficult but rewarding.
3915,"That is true, but even on crowded days there is great fun on the water!"
3915,So what kind of activities do you enjoy participating in when going out to a lake or the beach?  I personally enjoy fishing.
3915,Fishing is great fun.     I also enjoy just sailing in the sun.
3915,"I have never been sailing before although, I did used to own a small salt water shallow boat.  I used to take my father out in the ocean."
3915,How old was your father when you did those trips?
3915,"My father is recently 89 years old, this was about 15 years ago.  So he was in his 70's during those times."
3915,It is good you got to spend time together.    Is he still in good health?
3915,He is very fragile these days.  He recently had knee replacement surgery in hopes of being able to walk again.  Didn't work out that way.
3915,"That is a shame.     Getting older is hard, but better than not doing so!"
3915,"Yes indeed, getting old is hard.  One of the things my father really enjoyed doing was taking good care of his garden. "
3915,Do you also enjoy plants and landscaping?
3915,As a matter of a fact I am a florist.  My current profession has everything to do with all kinds of plants and flowers.
3916,That is true. I have met some who were just big babies though.
3916,i have to train dogs as part of my job in the army
3916,Do you work mostly with German Shepherds or all kinds of dogs?
3916,"mostly those yes, they seem to be most effective. do you like computers? "
3916,Just to get on the internet or play games.
3916,"i actually enjoy building them, making my own "
3916,Nice. Do you ever sell them or just use for yourself?
3916,"yeah i sell them online, its decent side money but i do it mostly for myself or friends and family"
3916,"It's always good to have a side gig. And if it's something you really enjoy, even better."
3916,what do you like ? besides the gaming haha
3916,I like to travel. I go to Disney World every year.
3916,"i do like to travel and love disneyland , never been to disney world"
3917,"Wow! I actually love the Rolling Stones, I just forgot the lead singer's name"
3917,"Yeah, a lot of people forget about him until they hear his name!"
3917,Yeah I bet! I want to go see them in concert one day.
3917,I would love to have seen them in concert too! We should go together if they ever tour again
3917,Is their next tour going to take them anywhere near Hawaii?
3917,"I wouldnt imagine so, is that where you live?"
3917,I'm planning on retiring there within the next 10 years.
3917,That's pretty cool. I don't think I could afford to!
3917,To retire? Or just to go visit?
3917,To retire! think that's gonna be a long time in the future for me.
3917,How many more years do you have?
3917,Realistically at least 10 or 15
3918,That's really interesting. The team I just started playing for is called the Tampa Bay Lizards actually. Do you like sports?
3918,not really. prefer taking my dog for walks. he and my lizard Nagini are my world!
3918,Nagini is such a cute name! My Iguana's name is D.B.... It's the alphabetic translation of my team number 42. How old is Nagini?
3918,14. how cool you have an iguana.  how big ? how long have you had?  team mascot?
3918,12 inches. I've had him for a year and he's our unofficial team mascot. He LOVES going to my games. Do your dog and lizard get along well?
3918,yes big babies together. trained dog to not carry him in his mouth. lizard rides on his back now.
3918,That's so adorable! I'd love to see a picture sometime. What do you feed Nagini?
3918,"crickets, romaine, scrambled eggs, raw vegetable gratings like carrot or sweet potato. occasional cut up grapes"
3918,D.B. is a huge fan of Romaine. Seems he's always nibbling on it. He also like hibiscus. Do you think I should get him a collar and leash?
3918,"yes. if they get lost, may not have skills to make it in wild. also prevents someone from stealing"
3918,Good point. I think after my next game I'll pick that up for him. Can you recommend any special treats he might like?
3918,"fresh mango or banana. a friend's iguana liked those. also, oddly, vanilla ice cream"
3919,"I have been doing my best to cheer her up. Pizza, movies..etc. Do you have any ideas of what else I could do? "
3919,"Get her involved in some physical activities. Definitely helps me clear my mind and get that endorphin rush, depending."
3919,That is a really good idea. We really enjoy dancing. Maybe I could take her out and dance to some old school Justin Timberlake. 
3919,Ah I love JT's music! That would be great! Are both of you fans?
3919,We are! Have been fans since N'SYNC. What music do you enjoy?
3919,"Hm. Lately I've been listening to Turkish music, some Japanese funk, or African funk. Just feels nice to explore something different, you know?"
3919,That is very interesting! I will have to check them out. I seem to stick with the same stuff I've always liked. Mostly 90s.
3919,Did 90s have lots of grunge type or garage metal music? That's what I associate with it.
3919,"Early 90s was definitely the grunge era. I like bands like Bush, Third Eye Blind, and Hootie and the Blowfish. Alternative rock. "
3919,"I'm familiar a little bit with Bush and Third Eye Blind, I liked their sound, just didn't get engaged with it I guess. Good luck with your friend though!"
3919,Thank you. I sure she will be joyful again soon. Sorry about your losses as well. 
3919,"Thanks. It can be hard, but strong support systems help me get through it. You sound like a good friend."
3920,Did you get graduate college?
3920,"Yes, I did.    I also went to medical school."
3920,That is incredible! What are you specializing in?
3920,I specialized in pediatrics.     Always good to help children.
3920,Yes children are wonderful. 
3920,"It is sad to see them sick, but very rewarding when they get better."
3920,I'm sure you deal with tons of crazy Mommas though.
3920,"Yes, but nurses are always ready with sedatives!   "
3920,Oh my. I can picture it now
3920,True.    In general there are more good ones than bad.    What do you do for fun other than mechanics?
3920,"Well, i want to be a librarian so reading is my passtime."
3920,What kind of books are your favorites?
3921,He's a lab/husky mix! Everyone always tells us how handsome he is.
3921,"He is a big dog huh, have you ever watched your brother dog before"
3921,He is! And I usually have to watch his dog since he moved out. I still live with our parents so it's convinient for me to babysit.
3921,so do you do babysitting for a living ?
3921,"Yeah, dogsitting technically, haha. I just love meeting all those new furry faces! What do you do for a living?"
3921,"I am chef, i could not imagine being a dogsitter. Do you have any pets of your own?"
3921,Being a chef sounds exciting! I don't have any pets of my own right now but I was thinking of getting a puppy for my bday in June!
3921,That sounds fun. What type of puppy?
3921,"Any puppy is fine to me, honestly. I'd love to give a home to one of the puppies at the little shelter nearby! You have any pets?"
3921,I currently do not but i considering get my son a puppy for Christmas
3921,I'm sure he'll love it! Are you planning on getting a specific breed?
3921,i was considering a Bishon Frise but not sure yet
3921,"How cute! Well whatever you decide, being a pet parent will be a rewarding experience. So good luck!"
3921,Thank you! I hope you have a good day.
3922,"thats such a freak accident, how did you manage that?"
3922,i worked in a kitchen and dropped a knife on my toe !
3922,That makes sense I guess! Did you go to the ER?
3922,"no , but we found help quickly ."
3922,It's a shame that you couldnt get the toe reattached!
3922,"Yes, it is....i have a hard time swimming now"
3922,"hahaha, I can't imagine its good to get in chlorinated water with a recently amputated toe. Do you like to swin?"
3922,"Yes, it does burn....asked my kid to bring me some Fritos from the store, but alas she did not!"
3922,"Not good, my wife said she was going to the store for milk and she never came back."
3922,Dont you get it?? FREE TOES! hahahaha
3922,"wow, pretty cheesy joke."
3922,"Hey, gotta laugh at your self to make it in this world with only 9 toes!"
3923,It really is relaxing. I am a lawyer at a very large law firm so finding a way to relax is a must
3923,"That's very nice. I don't know if you mind this, but my three roommates are in law school. do you mind giving them advice?"
3923,What kind of legal advice
3923,Family law advice and how to get through law school lol. 
3923,Ah i see
3923,Are you going to celebrate Halloween despite being busy as lawyer?
3923,Yes I will celebrate. I have a 3-year old daughter who can't wait! How about you?
3923,Yeah it's my favorite season because I get to wear orange all I want!! 
3923,is orange your favorite color?
3923,Yes! it is! It just felt warm but also vibrant. What's your favorite color?
3923,My favorite color is Pink. I like the hot colors
3923,That's my second favorite color. Is it your daughter favorite color as well? 
3924,Are you a professional mechanic?
3924,"I may not be a professional but, I do understand how to perform more than the basics on an automobile.  What is your fastest lap time?"
3924,I have run a mile in about seven minutes.
3924,That is a pretty decent time.  I would have no clue as to what is mine.  I jog 2 miles every other day to keep in shape.
3924,Very good!    I think people are running and walking more these days!
3924,YOU: I have always jogged and walked at my local track. It is close to 6 miles in a circular track around my town.
3924,Do you ever run the entire path?
3924,"I haven't been able to run it full, instead in portions.  The scenery is what keeps me going back for more. So peaceful."
3924,I can see that!    Is there much wildlife around the track?
3924,"Not much wildlife,  you will only find a big resace in the center filled with cat fish and alligator gars. What do you drive currently?"
3924,I drive a porsche from 1974.    Old but good!
3924,"That is nice, I currently own a 1961 Cobra - Stingray.  I only drive it out on the weekends to keep the gas mixed and engine going."
3925,"Oh yeah, library is a bad place, everyone will be distracted with that delish food"
3925,Silly!    I eat at the restaurant next door.
3925,Which was it again? I usually like to bring food from home.
3925,It is a hamburger restaurant.    They also have really good chicken.
3925,Do they have a good chicken sandwich?
3925,I really like their Chicken Parmesean sandwich!    Tastes like Italy.
3925,"Uh huh, and what does that taste like? Lol"
3925,"Not sure how to describe it, but it is very good!"
3925,I imagine Italian cooking sounds fresh. I might check it out some time.
3925,There is much more to it than spaghetti!
3925,Like penne or rigatoni??
3925,That too!   Lasagna is not just for cartoon cats!
3926,They are great because there's so many ways to prepare them
3926,Whats your favorite way?
3926,Probably french fries. You?
3926,baked potatoes are the best
3926,Those are pretty good too. Sometimes I'll give the skins to my dogs.
3926,Hmmm...didn't know dogs liked them!
3926,"Yeah, I have two bulldogs and they love them."
3926,I have a beagle. Her name is Linda.
3926,How old is she?
3926,9 months. Blue Tick color
3926,"Very cool. My dogs are older, around 7 years now."
3926,Nice. American? French?
3927,"yeah, as a long distance runner I need a lot of protein"
3927,Protein is so important! I'm currently helping my neighbor try to incorporate more into her diet. Do you know of any good shakes she might like?
3927,"spinach, banana, whole milk, 1 tsp peanut butter, ice cubes in a blender. "
3927,"That sounds really good. I think I'll try that for both of us, but living in the city it can be hard to find fresh spinach. Is frozen okay?"
3927,yes. but use it frozen and don't use ice cubes. add blueberries or strawberries too for a changeup
3927,Thanks for the tip! I'm helping my neighbor move some furniture later today and then we'll try this out. Any other ideas to blend in?
3927,flax or chia seeds. a tsp of buckwheat flour. a handful of walnuts or pecans. maybe a shot of coffee for a little caffeine lol. 
3927,I keep hearing good things about chia seeds but it's hard to find them in New York City for some reason. Know of any good online retailers?
3927,amazon. the answer to all things.  you seem like a great neighbor! 
3927,Oh thank you so much. She's a sweet person so I do what I can. Where do you live?
3927,where coffee is king. seattle. makes it easy to run fast and for long distances!
3927,I absolutely love Seattle and their coffee is the best! I still need to visit the Space Needle. Have you been ther?
3927,yes. but go to the chihuly glass museum next door. truly amazing and beautiful!
3928,"i'm a huge fan of animals, are you?"
3928,"Yes, of course. My husband is actually a veterinarian."
3928,"that's amazing, i'd love to be able to help animals like he does"
3928,There are plenty of places where you can volunteer to help out animals if you're interested.
3928,what would you recommend?
3928,Your local animal shelter should have available information on their website or if you send them an email they should be able to help.
3928,"that sounds great, i'll go sign up! so what is new for you?"
3928,I recently retired and my husband is going to soon.
3928,congratulations on retiring!
3928,Thanks so much! I'm really excited to travel more and relax.
3929,That's crazy! Definitely would have been cool to go to!
3929,"there were 32 acts, and 400000 people still came out for a rainy weekend, that is insane"
3929,Yeah you said! I think the rain would have make it pretty fun
3929,Yea im sure the rain enhanced some of the fun
3929,Have you ever been to a music festival?
3929,I have never been to a music festival personally. I have gone to concerts but I would love to try a festival someday. How about you?
3929,I've been to a lot! It's a nice change of pace from being in the office
3929,In an office huh what do you do for a living?
3929,I'm just a secretary at a law firm. What about you?
3929,"I am currently in college, im a swimmer. "
3929,"Thats nice, are you any good?"
3929,"i try to be , no point in being a bad one lol"
3930,I try to stay away from the sun and beds. I do not want skin cancer or damage. I like spray tans.
3930,"Oh I totally get it. I just grew up out in the sun, and my job let me continue that."
3930,The sun is great! I just have to make sure I wear lots of SPF. I am very pale. 
3930,My brother is like that. It seems like he just looks out the window and gets a sunburn. Made for some interesting vacations.
3930,I am sure it did. Haha! What do you do for a living? 
3930,I'm an engineer. Have been for about the last 5 years. What do you do?
3930,I am an editor. My sister became a published author when she was a teenager and it drew me in to editing. 
3930,"Oh, that's cool! I've always wanted to be a writer. I had a very good English teacher in high school that would encourage us to write every chance we got."
3930,I had an amazing English teacher in high school as well. It is wonderful to have a mentor like that. What type of engineer are you?
3930,"Electronic, but I'm taking a couple of months off to travel and just kind of relax. "
3930,"That's amazing and really nice. I love to travel. Where have you been recently? My last trip was Oslo, Norway. Beautiful place."
3930,"Have mostly been travelling around the US, staying away from the big tourist spots and just going where the road takes me."
3931,"It is absolutely beautiful here. But, you are right, people are moving all the time."
3931,How long have you lived in Kentucky?
3931,I grew up in Kentucky. I can't imagine living anywhere else.
3932,Who is your favorite singer?
3932,I really enjoy Madonna. She's one of my favorite singers. 
3932,"Oh wow, she is a great singer."
3932,I really want to see her on her next tour but I haven't gotten tickets yet.
3932,Tickets are so expensive these days.
3932,They really are. And you have to pay extra fees if you buy them online which make them even more expensive.
3932,"Yes, I think that's a rip off, but you can pick your seat online."
3932,The prices do vary a lot. It seems like the tickets are more expensive online than in person
3932,I think it's cause of the service charges.
3932,I think that's probably right. Do you like to sing? 
3932,"I used to sing, not so much these days. You?"
3932,I love singing! I try to sing whenever I can 
3932,"I used to sing to my fish, they loved it! lol"
3933,Probably go on a bike ride near the bayou.
3933,That sounds like fun! so you enjoy going on a bike designed for road cycling then?
3933,I use a hybrid bike for gravel trails mostly. I don't do much road biking unless it's an event. Just too dangerous.
3933,"A trail ride seems much better. Speaking of roads, my car needs repairs, I may get my bike out soon too"
3933,What kind of repairs does it need? Anything major?
3933,"Nothing serious, the AC is faulty my warranty should cover most of it.  It's very hot down here in the South"
3933,"I'm from the south too, I've got the same issue, no warranty though :("
3933,At least cooler weather is right around the corner! Do the seasons tend to effect your business volume?
3933,"Yeah! There's a nice cold front where I'm at, enjoyiinng it!! It does actually. Much busier in the winter."
3934,Have you ever been to a zoo?
3934,"Yes, I've been to many."
3934,What's your favorite animal to see at the zoo?
3934,I like to see dangerous animals like polar bears and lions.
3934,My favorite animals to see at the zoo are the giraffes. 
3934,Why do you like to see giraffes?
3934,They're just so odd to look at. I think it's interesting to see how evolution works to make an animal have a long neck like that
3934,How many zoos have you visited in the US? Outside the US?
3934,I've been to two different zoos in the US and one aquarium in Portugal 
3934,Oh yes. Aquariums are nice to visit.
3934,Whats your favorite animal to see at the aquarium? 
3934,Sharks of course.
3935,Yes I am going to a football game today
3935,I love football. What game are you going to and who is your favorite team?
3935,"I attend USF , and you?"
3935,I am an alumni of the University of Alabama. I do believe we are going to struggle against LSU if Tua hasn't recovered. 
3935,Best of luck! I follow college football but only because I am in college and mostly my team. I am not very knowledgeable unfortunately. 
3935,It's always good to expand your knowledge.
3935,What other interests do you have?
3935,I am currently learning German and I am a traveling salesperson. I love travel. You?
3935,I love travel too. I speak French fluently and try to travel to another country at least once a year. What countries have you visited?
3935,"All of Scandinavia, Germany, Italy, the Maldives...I have been many places. Norway was my favorite. How about you?"
3935,"Nice! I did a safari in Tanzania this summer, it was life changing"
3935,oh wow! I've always wanted to do that. You're quite brave
3936,"Yes, I am married.  Do you like to exercise?"
3936,I try but I just can't stay committed for long. Same reason I never got a dog; too much commitment. You?
3936,One of the reasons I exercise is I do have a dog and I was in the military for a while.
3936,"Nice, what breed is he? Is he a service dog?"
3936,"He is an alligator with fur lol, no he is a jack russell terrier.  So much energy, it is hard to keep up."
3936,Haha in that case the exercise must be really good to help get some of that energy out of him. 
3936,That's pretty much what it takes.  Have you thought about getting a cat?  They don't require much.
3936,Would love too but I'm actually pretty allergic to cats. :/ Have you ever owned a cat?
3936,"Oh, sorry to hear that.  Allergies can be tough.  Yes, I have a huge cat.  The dog and cat don't really get along of course."
3936,"Your house must be pretty exciting, a dog with boundless energy and a big cat who doesn't get along with him? Unstoppable force meets immovable object haha."
3936,That's right!  Hopefully the weather warms up so I can take the dog for a jog.
3936,"Yeah if the weather looks good I may go for a jog too, actually."
3936,Nice!  One of my military buddies is calling I have to run.  Nice chatting with you!
3937,"When they called my name some random guy walked up and took my drink without paying, what would you do?"
3937,Sorry to hear that.  Did you see the guy who did it? 
3937,I was on my phone... but when I asked them what was taking so long they said my drink had already been picked up
3937,I hope they made you another cup with no charge.  That would be a bummer.
3937,I still had to pay for it and wait but yes they did
3937,"I had someone steal a package off my front porch, and I felt a little violated."
3937,That's terrible!  I can't understand why people do things like this...
3937,I think we have a declining morality problem in our country.  People had rather steal than work.
3937,"It's sad, I wonder if it's how people raise their children or media or what that's causing this..."
3937,Too many parents are not taking the time and effort to teach their children the proper values.
3937,These kids kicking and screaming and cursing at their parents in stores these days etc... It's like they expect the public school system to raise them for them
3937,"I would never have gotten by with any of the junk kids today.  My dad believed in, ""spare the rod and spoil the child"". "
3938,"I assume so, I didn't talk to him but I told a sales associate about it and they announced it on the P.A."
3938,That was nice of you. I am sure the kid was scared and didn't know what to do.
3938,"Yea, that's why I didn't approach them, I didn't want to scare him anymore than he already was"
3938,"Yeah, it may have freaked him out and he might have started crying even harder."
3938,"That's what I figured would happen, I didn't stick around long enough to see if his mom came soon thereafter unfortunately but I assume she did"
3938,"Well, I am sure the store associates took care of it from there."
3938,"No doubt.  Nothing scary about a teenage girl in a red vest, right?"
3938,Nope. She probably reminded him of a babysitter.
3938,haha hopefully a good one who could make him laugh
3938,Hopefully. What else did you do after the grocery store?
3938,Well...  I got groceries haha almost tried to get the number of this cute chick in the frozen aisle but chickened out last minute
3938,Probably just as well. A lot of women don't like to be approached like that.
3938,"Yea, that's for sure...  Thanks for the conversation!"
3939,"Give some examples of this industry, please."
3939,"There are three categories: public, corporate and private"
3939,Company names?
3939,"I'm not sure of the exact names, but I know that there are many different kinds of public affairs companies"
3939,I'm not too familiar with the public affairs industry. Just trying to educate myself.
3939,I think that's really cool. What other subjects do you want to learn about?
3939,Almost anything really. I believe you can't know too much.
3939,What subject interests you the most?
3939,Probably medical - like autoimmune diseases specifically.
3939,Are you in the medical field? 
3939,Used to be. Worked for a non-profit hospital system.
3939,Was your old hospital active in research?
3940,I work a lot and dont really have much time off
3940,how come ? just work and stuff ?
3940,Yes I work at a very fast paced law firm. How about you
3940,I work as a welder very  different
3940,That sounds very different loll
3940,Yeah i met some guys that went from law to fabrication haha
3940,What do you do for fun?
3940,"I make things and fix things I have a small machine shop at my house, lol"
3940,So you must be very handy then!
3940,i like to fix things yeah but once i do it and learn it i move on and specifics don't interest me anymore
3941,what is your favorite beatles album?
3941,It's a toss up between Abbey Road and Revolver. I'm listening to the song Help though right now while eating some veggies! What's you favorite?
3941,i think the white album is my favorite. do you enjoy hiking?
3941,"The White Album is great too! I love hiking, but my last trip I ate some peanuts and had an allergic reaction. Where do you like to hike?"
3941,uh oh! i am near the shenandoah national park so there are lots of good spots there
3941,I've hiked there myself. Virginia is great. They have the best farmers markets. I got the best kale last time I was there. Do you like veggies?
3941,that is true. i do! i love bell peppers and brussel sprouts
3941,"Brussel sprouts are my favorite! There's a recipe I wanna try, but it calls for peanuts and I'm allergic. Know of any good substitutes?"
3941,hmm you could try almonds or cashews
3941,Walnuts are really good for you actually! The protein and fatty acids might be more beneficial than peanuts too. What other veggies do you like?.
3941,i never knew that. i really like kale as well
3941,"Kale has fiber, antioxidants, calcium, and vitamin K.. Even the chlorophyll in kale has health benefits. Do you like it raw or cooked?"
3942,"Those are very interesting hobbies. I play violin, but I love the sound of the sax. "
3942,I love music from classical to modern. Do you play in an orchestra?
3942,I don't. I mostly play for weddings and special occasions as a soloist. What is the name of your jazz band? 
3942,"It is a school band, it doesn't have a name. Do you remodel homes for a living or as a hobby?"
3942,It is a hobby. I enjoy flipping houses. My main job is nursing. What are you studying in school?
3942,Music for now but hoping to add business in the future
3942,"As long as you follow your dreams, you'll do great things. "
3942,I agree! Do you like nursing?
3942,I do. I work in a psych ward and it is very rewarding. 
3942,Not easy probably but mental health is such an important issue. 
3942,It really is. I wish there wasnt such a stigma around it. 
3942,"I think we are getting better at talking about it and accepting it but you are right, people feel uncomfortable adressing it still. No one is immune"
3943,"Yes, he just seems to be extremely tired."
3943,I hope he's okay. I hate when my dog is sick.
3943,I understand. You want to give them the best care but it's also so expensive.
3943,"Yes the high costs of maintaining their health add to the overall cost, but they are great dogs."
3943,"Yes, dogs are fantastic. The vet had some blood taken. He thinks it might be cancer."
3943,Bless your heart. I hope they find out and it's something they can treat it easily.
3943,Thank you. Won't know for a few days.
3943,I hope everything turns out okay.
3943,Thank you. I hope you don't ever have to hear those words from your vet.
3943,yea true
3943,What kind of dogs do you have?
3943,i have a pug
3944,Its a good day to listen to music and get my dance on!
3944,cool beans! i like pop music myself and riding my bike!
3944,This time of year I like to hunt and fish. I can't wait until I can hunt and kill my own turkey for thanksgiving.
3944,I like to fish as well. Will you be having your Thanksgiving at your home this year?
3944,Yes we will be celebrating thanksgiving at home this year. Last year we went out of town on vacation to San Antonio for thanksgiving. How will you be celebrating? 
3944,I have always wanted to go to Texas. I have heard great thing about it! I will be traveling to Delaware to visit my family.
3944,Sounds like you like to exercise. Me too. Hopefully I can maintain my thin figure after all this holiday eating I plan to do in the next couple of months.
3944,it helps if you work out to music . i prefer christian electronic as my jam .
3944,I think I might try that suggestion. Sounds like it works for you and keeps you motivated.
3944,"me too . between classes i like to watch the walking dead , lol"
3944,Oh i love that show. Zombies are the best!
3944,I love The Walking Dead. Grimes gets on my nerves a bit though. I'm rooting for the walkers half the time.
3945,I will be there in a few minutes.  I'll bring something that will be interesting.
3945,What are you going to bring? Can I have a hint?
3945,I'm trying to decide if it will be a short book or maybe an interesting magazine.
3945,I love to read books and magazines. Maybe bring both?
3945,I can do that.  Maybe you can read and enjoy the zoo at the same time.
3945,That would be great! I can bring the magazine to read in the car on the way to the zoo
3945,I'll bring one that has a lot of pictures so you won't have to get too mentally involved but still enjoy th content.
3945,I think thats a good idea. Magazines with lots of pictures are my favorite.
3945,Maybe I'll bring one with pictures of the latest automobiles so you can determine what kind of car you want to purchase.
3945,I need a new car; that would be very nice of you 
3945,I am thinking about getting a hybrid myself so I can reduce my fuel costs.
3945,What kind of hybrid car are you interested in?
3946,"Yes, you're right, I prefer the moon, the night is calm and romantic, don't you think?"
3946,"i like the sunshine , but i do like night over day. It has a calming effect"
3946,yes i think the same
3946,So what do you do for fun?
3946,"I like to play guitar, and go to movies"
3946,"video games keep my busy at night , not too good for my eye sight"
3946,"I like karaoke too, do you sing?"

3947,Great dogs! What are their names?
3947,their names are sebastian and stanley
3947,That's adorable! I've been thinking about getting Mr Fluffy a playmate. Are your English Bulldogs good with other animals?
3947,"they are good at playing with others, but they are lazy sometimes"
3947,Haha! Lazy can be good at times though. Mr Fluffy is hyperactive. How long have you had your dogs?
3948,The crazier the better!
3948,Nice! How often do you get haircuts?
3948,"Maybe every three months, I keep it fairly long so I have options. Do you have a fun, crazy habit?"

3948,But having good relationships can help with that.
3948,definitely
3948,what do you do besides party with your friends ?
3949,I consider it an art and therefore I like to think of myself as an artist
3949,"I am an amatuer ballroom dance competitor, and choreography is so important in this.. "
3949,That's cool. Why is it so important? 
3949,"This is a couples art form, and synchronization and continuity are essential to a good score."
3949,I see. Do you participate in any other art forms?
3949,I do some performance art at the coffee shop where I work. It is a good way to increase tips.
3949,Oh that's a really good idea. Are you more of a coffee or a tea drinker?
3949,"Coffee in the morning, but tea in the evening. You?"
3949,"I like both. I drinking mostly coffee, but it's usually because I forget that tea is an option. "
3949,Have you ever had black tea with hazelnut? It tastes a lot like coffee!
3949,"I haven't. I've never heard of that, but it sounds incredible! I'm going to try it for sure. "
3949,And it even has some caffeine in it to give you that coffee lift in the morning!
3950,I read this fantastic book about giant Armadillos that roamed the earth during prehistoric times.
3950,I also learned that the Aztecs had a name for them which translated to 
3950,"That translates to? Sorry, I didn't catch the end of your sentence."
3950,turtle-rabbit. I am not sure why it did not complete my sentence. 
3950,Ah! turtle-rabbits would make fantastic creatures to base a novel on. I wonder if they would be predators or prey. 
3950,"It is an interesting combo. I believe they would be prey. Not sure what a ""turtle-rabbit"" could do haha. "
3950,"They could be fast as a rabbit, but have their own shell that they could hide in as soon as they see danger."
3950,Yeah I didn't think about that. Could see some benefit there..
3950,Might be a novel that only a few people appreciate though.
3950,"Good point. But maybe, just maybe, it'll be brilliant."
3950,True! I guess the only thing I can do is try to write it.
3950,"Ah, yes, the lucrative writing career."
3951,Have you ever been interested in a job in marketing?
3951,I hadn't really considered it. I did take some marketing classes in college though. What about you?
3951,"Not interested in marketing. It does seem interesting, though."
3951,What kinds of fields are you interested in?
3951,Medical field would be my preference.
3951,What do you want to do in the medical field?
3951,Working with patients. Maybe children.
3951,That would be really cool and very noble of you
3951,Maybe a pediatrician's office. To me I think children are all so innocent.
3951,So you want to work in the out-patient setting?
3951,"Yes, outpatient setting."
3951,Do you think kids should be seen by a pediatrician or by a GP?
3952,i had a really exciting lunch the other day would you like to hear about it?
3952,Yeah of course. Hope you don't mind my daughter reads your story too though. She's on my lap. Lol
3952,no worries! i had a private lunch with will ferrell
3952,He's so funny! What was he like? Is he tall?
3952,he was very friendly. we talked about classical jazz a lot because i am a huge fan and it turns it he is too
3952,I'm a fan too. That's cool to know. I ask how tall he was because being a person who's only 5'5 I'm really impressed by tall people.
3952,i don't know his exact height but i am 5'6 and he was at least a foot taller than me
3952,Yeah he's obviously pretty tall. What did you guys eat for lunch?
3952,we had sandwiches at a diner in los angeles
3952,Sounds good! What kind did Will eat?
3952,i think he got a turkey club
3952,My daughter told me to tell you that sounds yummy. Now you got me wanting a sandwich. So where you from?
3953,Yes I like to paint and write poetry.
3953,"That's a very creative process, both artistically and through the written word, too."
3953,I love both. What type of museums do you visit?
3953,I like Green museums. The help people be more conscious of their world and it's limitations and how their actions affect it.
3953,That's wonderful. What do you do for work?
3953,i work for a greeting card company . as a proofreader .
3953,Amazing. We have the same kind of job. Do you like it?
3953,i love it . what do you do to pay the bills ?
3953,I use my salary from the card company. I'm planning a celebration for my parents right now.
3953,that's sweet . congratulations to you . how old are they ?
3953,The celebration is for their 40th anniversary. They are in their sixties.
3953,sounds awesome.  You should throw a huge party to thank them
3953,Are you close to your parents?
3954,Angel's landing Campground
3954,Im wondering if thats part of Sonora.
3954,It is not part of Sonora .
3954,ok. what else new?
3954,I am going to miss the restaurants
3954,Do you have a new place to eat?
3954,Not really.
3954,Oh. Well keep looking. You will find something soon.
3954,hopefully. What is the name of your favorite restaurant?  
3954,Its called lucy's. it's near my house. I have had so many good memories there
3954,Oh that's cool.
3954,I can't wait to eat there once again!
3955,Ah! So he's a contemporary artist?
3955,"Yep! I do similar work, myself, building houses out of matches. He's my inspiration."
3955,That's fantastic! I love art that tells a story about our lives. Do you have an exhibit?
3955,"Not currently. I don't have family to visit, so I'm a bit intimidated by the art scene. "
3955,"I know it's scary to get out there. The first time I played on a stage, I was trembling. But it was also a rush."
3955,i can imagine ! that is so awesome !
3955,I need to do something creative. My job is so boring. I feel like I've been doing it forever.
3955,Maybe its time to launch your art career full time.
3955,"That's a great idea! I'm scared to try, but maybe I could plan to do it in a few months. You could design the set."
3955,"Sure, sounds like fun! "
3955,Have you designed a large art project before?
3955,"I designed a match town for my college final, if that counts."
3956,I have only seen previews.
3956,"I was told that it was good, but I was still surprised when I actually saw the show."
3956,Right on.  What is your favorite show?  Ever seen 'NELK' on youtube?
3956,"Have not seen Nelk on youtube, but I just watched the whole series of ""Suits"" and it was great."
3956,You gotta check out 'NELK' they are pretty funny.  I've only saw Suits once.  So how is your saturday going?
3956,I just got back in town from NYC so I am trying to recover from a 910 mile drive.
3956,"I love long car rides.  I went from Denver to Atlanta, but had to stop in Dallas on the way. Loved it."
3956,"I prefer cars to planes because I get really sick every time I fly, and I like driving and traveling in nice cars."
3956,I love traveling in nice cars.  Just an amazing experience.  I bet you would make a great co-pilot.
3956,A road trip in a Lexus is about as good as it gets from my standpoint.  I like to drive or just ride with someone else.
3956,Your speaking to my heart.  Love Lexus.  Certain Lincolns are nice too.  Really been eyeing the new Continental.  You have a Lexus?
3956,"The last Continental I had was about 35 years ago, and they were so big they were like rolling barges at that time."
3956,Are you male or female?
3956,"I am an older male who has owned many cars in my lifetime, and almost all were very nice. "
3957,I'm headed to Italy for 10 days. I've never been before. 
3957,Nice! I visited Spain not too long ago. I am positive you will have a blast.
3957,Where in Spain did you visit?
3957,Sicily. 
3957,"I don't think that's in Spain, is it?"
3957,I had a brain fart. I read it as Italy haha. I have been to Barcelona and Seville. 
3957,Oh nice. I studied abroad in Barcelona. It was a blast!
3957,That's awesome! Where else have you been?
3957,I spend some time in PAris and London too. What about you? Have you traveled around?
3957,I have been all over Scandinavia and Germany. Norway is my favorite. 
3957,I'd like to visit Norway. It is on my list of places to go. 
3957,it is absolutely beautiful 
3958,"Oh, I'm sorry!  What is wrong, if you don't mind me asking?"
3958,It's okay. I broke my legs and back in a car accident many years ago. I am stuck in my bed most of the time now.
3958,"Sorry to hear that!  I am a pitcher for the Houston Astros, so I hope you'll watch us play tonight!"
3958,Thanks. Is that your full time job? I will be watching!
3958,"Yes, full time!  We won last night so it is Nationals 2 - Us 1. Who are you hoping to win the series?"
3958,I hope the Red Sox win. I love baseball! What time are you playing?
3958,"Well, the Red Sox aren't playing!  LOL!  It's Nationals vs. Houston at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time"

3958,"Well, it was great chatting with you!  I better get back to baseball practice!  "
3959,Have you ever visited Algeria?
3959,"No, but my family was from there"
3959,Interesting. Do you plan to visit to understand more about your family history?
3959,I think one day that would be fun to do. Where is your family from?
3959,My family is from El Salvador?
3959,"That is interesting, what things do you do while living in America to keep your heritage alive?"
3959,I'm more Americanized now. I do continue to eat some of the foods that remind me of my heritage.
3959,I am sure you had a large cultural change?
3959,"Yes, an extreme cultural change. Came to US during the civil war in El Salvador."
3959,Ahhh...I found out that there were people reenacting the Civil war before the real fighting had ended.
3959,The Civil war here in America or El Salvador?
3959,In El Salvador
3960,They can be but Ithink not everyone is cut out to be a teacher. What do you do for a living?
3960,"I'm a principal at a grade school. Yup, students are annou=ying for sure."
3960,"Wow, you need to change job!"
3960,That's what my therapist tells me. Something about repressed hostility could give me an ulcer. I wish I were a pro wrestler.
3960,"LOL not exactly the same field. Do you have a hobby that let's you unwind and get your ""anger"" out?"
3960,I am a sports nut. I love to play or watch most sports. You?
3960,"I hate football, I play tennis and like to run"
3960,Two great ways to get exercise and fresh air at the same time!
3960,For sure! What is your favorite sport?
3960,I am into parkour and freerunning. I do flips off of walls and hop from car to car in parking lots.
3960,Wow that's super impressive! Not sure the car owners appreciate that too much but hey sounds like you are a free spirit
3960,"Gotta stay in shape, eat well, and stay away from the mall parking lot."
3960,too funny! Have a great day!
3961,I can't even imagine. My kids are everything to me.
3961,"next to losing a child , losing parents is the hardest thing a person can go through"
3961,"I'm lucky, my parents are still healthy and my kids are doing great. I had better knock on wood!"
3961,"I know what you mean. I lost my parents when I was young. It's been hard, but thankfully I had a good support system."
3961,Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Glad to know you had a good support system. Do you have brothers or sisters?
3961,An older brother. He took care of me in my teen years and helped make sure I went to college. I had to work really hard
3961,"I'm glad to hear that he took care of you. Education is so important, it opens so many doors for the future."
3961,I agree.  What about you? Siblings?
3961,I have two sisters. I am lucky we are close. We go mountain biking every Sunday together. 
3961,wow ! that's great . i like to mountain bike .
3961,Me too! It's a great stress reliever after a busy week at work.
3961,i bet ! maybe i should go out and exercise more with my time off .
3962,It's a perfect lifestyle
3962,What do you like most about the lifestyle?
3962,It gives me time to focus on myself and my animals
3962,What are some of your favorite animals?
3962,I'm partial to sheep! What about you?
3962,I love dogs! I have one myself
3962,I also have a dog. Dogs make great companions! What kind of dog do you have?
3962,I have a bloodhound! What about you?
3962,Mine's a boxer! He's a sweetheart. Do you have any other animals?
3962,"Thats great! I don't have any other animals, one dog is more than enough to try and keep up with for me "
3962,They can be a mess!
3962,My dog almost ran away this morning. Her collar broke while I was out walking her
3963,That's amazing. What kind of video games do you play
3963,I like old school arcade games. Do you play any games?
3963,"Yeah, my favorite one would be the Sims because I can re-create my black lab. It's so cute. "
3963,"Aw, cute! Do you have any other pets?"
3963,"No, but I do consider getting a cat. I want my lab to have a friend when I'm gone for work lol. What about you?"
3963,That makes sense! I have one cat myself.
3963,Cute! What breed is he/she? We should have a playdate lol. 
3963,"I'm not sure what breed she is. She has quite the temper with other animals, though. So a playdate might not be the best idea, lol."
3963,"haha, alright. When my lab is acting up, I usually put on Charlie Daniels to calm him down. It work somehow."
3963,"That's awesome! My cat tends to like it when my fiance whistles, but that's about it."
3963,"Aw. Cute. Do you have any favorite singers or you like your fiance whistle, too? lol"
3963,"LOL, he's a good whistler, but I wouldn't consider it a favorite. I like old school rock and roll.. too many to name, lol. What about you?"
3964,It's about 10 feet deep and 22 feet wide. Have you ever dealt with a sinkhole?
3964,No I have not  but I have seen many in the news on TV. It must have been scary!y for you!
3964,It is a little bit. I just don't want it to creep closer to my house! 
3964,Thank God your house was not in the hole! Did anyone get hurt?
3964,Nope! Also lucky. My dog is wondering a lot about what is going on. Do you have any pets?
3964,"No, no pets. My wife and kids are allergic to animal hair. But my grand kids have a  real cute dog named Bella."
3964,That's a sweet name. What kind of dog is Bella?
3964,It's a breed of a Labrador. It is so hugable. It likes to be carried by people and petted.
3964,"That must be perfect for your grandkids. I am thinking about getting another dog, but I'm not sure what breed yet. "
3964,"If I were to get a dog, I would go for a smaller breed like a chihuahua, Miniature Pinscher or a Maltese."
3964,Hmm. I've only ever had big dogs. I'm afraid I would lose a small dog in my own home! 
3964,Maybe you could equip it something like a beeper used for locating your lost phone at home.
3965,"I like my steak bloody, but I think I am turning into a vegetarian"
3965,I can't handle the sight of blood. Makes me feel dizzy and faint!
3965,So you
3965, I half close my eyes when I take the steak out of the package and just throw it on the BBQ until it's done!
3965,"I get that, it's gross, that's why being a vegetarian is more and more appealing. so you're not a surgeon?"
3965,"Ha! No, I'm a roofer. The only blood I see is if I hammer a nail through my hand."
3965,"That's a hard job, I'm afraid of heights. Have you ever fallen off a roof?"
3965,"Once, but it was a good thing there was a bush by the wall. I only broke my wrist."
3965,"When you don't hammer nails, what hobbies do you have?"
3965,I have always wanted to learn about scotch. Which single malt is your favorite?
3965,"Well it is actually my Dad's collection, I was not supposed to drink any of it, he's gonna be mmaaadd"
3965,Ha ha! That's the perfect kind...someone else's!
3965,Enjoy your steak!
3965,Cheers!
3966,Do you always take your dog with you?
3966,"Most of the time, but he gets kinda bored down there on his own. Steady barking at me up there."
3966,What kind of dog is it?
3966,An Australian Shepherd...he's the best! So smart! Do you have any dogs?
3966,I love those.  I have a German Shorthaired Pointer
3966,"Omg, I love those dogs! I recently wrote an essay on dog and their behaviors in situations, and they are very smart also. Do you have any other pets?"
3966,"No, just my dog"
3966,"I think they used to be called Alsatian in the UK, if I remember correctly."
3966,Hmm..interesting
3966,"So, what do you do for a living?"
3966,I teach and do research
3966,"Oh, wow, that's awesome! What do you teach?"
3967,Nice.  What do you like best about them?
3967,"Well, they are so comfortable and I love the interior design, and they drive super fast!"
3967,I like to drive fast.  Like in Texas where there are miles and miles of nothing so you can go fast.
3967,"I love Texas...you are right, some roads are miles and miles of nothing!  "
3967,The only time that's a problem is if I drank too much soda and there's nowhere to stop!  My favorite is Sprite.  What about you?
3967,"I used to drink a lot of Diet Coke, but lately don't drink much soda at all!  "
3967,"I keep saying I will quit, but then I don't. I can't drink caffeine though which is why I do Sprite. How did you stop?"
3967,"I hate an operation five years ago & when I woke up, Diet Coke tasted horrible to me!  So I quit drinking it."
3967,That sounds like my grandma.  She used to smoke but got alzheimers. One day we think she just forgot she smoked.
3967,"Well, good that she forgot!  Hey, are you any good at math?"
3967,I had to stop helping my kids with their math homework when they got to 4th grade.  What kind of math?
3967,"All math!  I am terrible at math, so I am looking for someone to help me out."
3968,I usually just get my hair done! What about you?
3968,Whenever I have a special occasion I like to get my hair done. 
3968,Is it expensive to get your hair done?
3968,I have my own salon so I get a discount. 
3968,Is it a large discount?
3968,"Yes, I could choose to pay nothing but employees get a 25% discount. "
3968,How long have you owned the salon?
3968,I have owned the salon for about 4 years now. 
3968,Do you enjoy owning the salon?
3968,"Very much so yes, I get to meet many different types of people. "
3968,Do you ever want to have a different career?
3968,"I've thought about it, but this is what I have a passion for. "
3969,"thats interesting, i've always wanted to take my cat there anyway."
3969,I love the view.  It's so relaxing on the beach
3969,"i know, it's a nice place to get away as well."
3969,My kids love playing in the sand and the water
3969,how many kids do you have?
3969,i have 4.  Do you have any kids
3969,"no, but i do have four animals."
3969,I am a cat lover.  What type of animals do you have
3969,"a cat and 3 dogs, it's hard cause i have allergies but i still love them"
3969,Animals are like kids.  They give you a whole lot of love
3969,"thats very true, they have something special to offer in a relationship too."
3969,I bet they do.  They offer a lot to many people.  
3970,It's not that hard! I'm sure you could learn how to do it easily!
3970,I've always been worried about being stuck somewhere with a flat tire and being unable to change it. Glad to hear it's easy to learn!
3970,That's definitely a valid fear! 
3970,I wonder if anyone in my yoga class could teach me to change a tire. If not maybe we could all learn how together haha.
3970,"There you go! Win/win, haha! I've been thinking of trying out yoga! Do you enjoy it?"
3970,"You should definitely try it out, even alone it's relaxing, and paired with some lifestyle changes you feel so healthy and rejuvinated!"
3970,"I've been trying to live a healthier lifestyle, so this sounds like it would be a great addition to my regular mountain biking routine."
3970,Haha mountain biking sounds so intense in comparison! It'll definitely help you get ready for the day and even help you relax after a session of biking.
3970,"It is pretty intense, haha. That's why I think yoga would be a nice addition.. give me a chance to relax a little, lol."
3970,"I only started it myself a few months back, a few of my coworkers suggested it to me and I haven't stopped since!"
3970,That's awesome. What else do you like to do in your spare time?
3970,I like to sit at the park and people-watch. I work with the local newspaper so it's good to just relax and watch the goings-on everywhere. You?
3971,Sometimes. I also take my sister Jessica flying too.
3971,"Sounds like an awesome experience. I want to learn how to fly, but I can't decide between flying or self-defense lol."
3971,Self-defense is a good thing to learn though. Even as just a way to exercise.
3971,"Yes it is, good exercise and can be useful for dangerous situation. Do you have any hobbies beside flying sometimes?"
3971,I like to paint the places I've been. What about you?
3971,"That's amazing. Do you sells painting? I don't have time to do anything much, beside watching Netflix on the weekend for entertainment lol"
3971,I've thought about it but I haven't sold any yet. I mostly just post them on Twitter. I love Netflix a lot.
3971,"Yeah, me too :). What's your favorite show? I've been watching some horror shows."
3971,My favorite Netflix original is Aggretsuko. I just watched Living with yourself and that was pretty trippy and dark.
3971,Thanks for the rec! I may have to check it out. Aggretsuko is an anime right? Do you usually watch anime?
3971,Yeah it's kind of like anime. And I used to? I haven't watched anything new in awhile. My favorite anime is Cowboy Bebop.
3971,"Oh that show is nice, I haven't check it out yet. I recently watch Megalo Box, the main character kinda look like someone from Cowboy Bebop."
3971,I haven't heard of that one. I'll have to check it out.
3971,"Yeah, it is an amazing show. Very intense fighting! It was nice talking to you, I got to go now :) "
3972,"They've always been my favorite group!  My mother used to dance around the floor singing ""I can't get no"" over and over."
3972,I love them too! It is because of Mick Jagger that I stared to play the guitar.
3972,"Oh, I started playing guitar because of The Beatles!  Twist and Shout, over and over again!  LOL"
3972,There is just something about the guitar that makes music much more fun and energetic! 
3972,"I agree!  I have been trying to learn to play mandolin lately, but it's just not as much fun as guitar."
3972,Is the mandolin difficult to play?
3972,"No, I think it is easier than guitar actually, but I don't like it as much.  "
3972,"Thank makes sense, the guitar is definitely more fun to play. "
3972,"I used to play a console organ and loved that too, until it broke!  LOL"
3972,That is so funny! How did it break?
3972,I don't know!  Something inside that was expensive to fix.  I have to run for my 12 hour shift as a nurse.  Nice chatting.
3972,That stinks that it broke like that. Have a nice shift! 
3973,"I saw the Rolling Stones in concert when I was 15. Man, it was amazing!"
3973,I bet that was amazing. I got to see Paul McCartney live a few years ago.  
3973,Wow! I'm so jealous. Was he still as good as he was in the past?
3973,Yes!  What a show. I would love to meet him in person.  Who is your favorite musician?
3973,"While the rolling stones is my favorite band, I do have to say that Jimmy Page is my favorite musician of all time."
3973,I like a variety of music. My tastes have changed over time and I appreciate rock and roll more as I get older.
3973,I've always loved a good rock concert. My work is so boring...I need something to look forward to!
3973,I can relate. My friends are trying to convince me to take a cruise with them. I've never done one but it sounds like it might be fun.
3973,That does sound like fun! Is it a sand and sun or Mediterranean sight-seeing cruise? 
3973,It goes to the Bahamas. It's four days.  So a nice long weekend getaway. Have you cruised before?
3973,"No, but it's on my bucket list. My friends are just all beer and football though."
3973,"Beer and football.  Football and beer.  And the World Series now, too.  Astros or Nationals?  I'm pulling for the Astros."
3973,"Any football, but go Astros go! Cheers!"
3974,I have only tasted vietnamese food once and it was spicy
3974,i've had it once or twice when i went to visit .
3974,I liked it but the spice was too much for me
3974,I'm not bothered by spice too much. When I was in India I had a lot of it
3974,i have never been to India.  What was it like
3974,It was very beautiful but also very busy. People are very nice there
3974,I would like to travel someday.  Where else have you traveled
3974,"I have been to vietnam, thailand, india, australia and japan"
3974,Very interesting. Did you have a favorite place of those places you visited
3974,"Yes, I liked Thailand the best because of the beaches"
3974,Sounds great.  Are you traveling again soon
3974,"No, no plans to. How about you?"
3975,"I used to only have 6 cats, but now I have 200 cats"
3975,Dang! That's a lot of cats! I hope they're outside cats!! lol
3975,"Some are outside, some are inside.  Im hoping to get on an episode of Hoarders"
3975,"Haha...I've been on one already, lol! I'm a truck driver, so I have a lot of stuff accumulated from the road."
3975,"That's a good job, but it can get pretty lonely, I bet"
3975,"Yeah, but I have my cat Milly to help me stay sane. I take her on every trip"
3975,"Ah, cats are great!  Im using a voice to text ap, since I never learned how to write"
3975,"Wow, I'm sorry to hear that. I guess it's great that there are tools to aid in that these days"
3975,"Thanks, it's a struggle, but I think Im getting better at it"
3975,That's great! There is technology that can help you with that. 
3975,"Yes, thankfully I wasn't born 20 years sooner!"
3975,"Oh, I know it! Those were the days, though, lemme tell ya! No tech meant playing outside and enjoying your family and working the hard way!"
3976,I think I did alright all things considered. 
3976,That's good. It's nice when everything turns out great in the end.
3976,That's for sure. I had to reward myself with a shopping trip afterwards. 
3976,"shopping is fun, i like to shop for my pets in particular."
3976,I love shopping for just about anything. What kind of pets do you have?
3976,i have a snake and a cat.
3976,I wonder how the cat reacts to the snake. 
3976,"she likes him, i mean she's had to get used to him over time. do you have pets?"
3976,That's good to hear. I have two dogs. 
3976,"aww, what kind?"
3976,Both of them are a mix of many things. Both rescues as well. 
3976,"rescues are the best, it's so good when dogs get homes after needing them for so long."
3976,Definitely! They all deserve loving homes. 
3977,I love turtles!  They are never in a hurry!  We should be more like them!
3977,I love turtles too. The one I have is named Killer. I got him from a friend that wasn't able to take care of him any more.
3977,"Oh, love that name!  Do you know how old Killer is?  "
3977,He is at least 10 years old. He is an Eastern Box turtle.
3977,Wow!  That's cool!  I just got home from working at the grocery store and I'm having cupcakes for dinner!  LOL
3977,Lucky! I'm sure I could convince my husband to do that sometime. We've had breakfast for dinner a few times.
3977,I just had breakfast for dinner last night!  Pancakes and eggs!  Love it!
3977,"Same here! He cooks pancakes, eggs, sausage and bacon. My daughter loves it too. lol"
3977,That's great that your husband cooks!  I don't eat meat or I would have bacon too.  
3977,I hear that the Beyond burger makes good vegan substitutes. I've also seen some youtubers make successful tofu bacon by marinating the tofu. 
3977,"Yes, I enjoy Beyond Burger and there is a fake bacon I buy that I love, but can't remember the name of it!"
3977,I would eat more alternative meat things but cooking almost 2 separate meals would be a lot for me to do.
3978,"Go slow, I wouldn't want you to get hurt. ;)"
3978,Thanks. I am very careful.  
3978,Football is my favorite activity.  Do you have a favorite team?
3978,I like the Los Angeles Raiders. Who is your favorite team
3978,"Ugh, a rival.  Go Chiefs! "
3978,I know right.  Do you like college football.
3978,"Definitely, we watch a lot of gator football.  How about you?"
3979,"Interesting. I don't know much about the history, but I do like watching a good game of soccer."
3979,"me too, what teams do you like?"
3979,I like to watch the USA team - men or womens.
3979,"me too, i love when FIFA world cup comes around."
3979,Exactly. I wish I was from a state that has a professional team.
3979,my state has a professional team so it's funny you say that.
3979,Seems those who live in states with professional teams really get into it.
3979,"yeah definetely, my grandparents are obsessed with it more than i am."
3979,Have you been to any of the games in your state?
3979,"yes i have, its fun to be in the stadium."
3979,I'm sure. I like going to sporting events in stadiums. Like the crowd but not the expenses.
3979,"true , they can be just as expensive lol ."
3980,yes i was able to finish.
3980,That's good then! Did she like it?
3980,yes i do like my toy.
3980,"Oh, I thought it was for your niece. I'm glad you like it. Do you usually like making things for people?"
3980,"yes it was my niece, but she give it to me."
3980,What kind of toy is it?
3980,it was a robot.
3980,"Wow! That's really interesting, what does it do?"
3980,it lights up and talk.
3980,Very neat. Can you see in the dark with it?
3980,"yes, it shine like a flashlight."
3980,That's a fancy sounding robot. What a great gift. Was it expensive?
3981,"I am terrified of them, but once you're strapped in, there's nothing left to do but hold on and scream!"
3981,i bet . i do not think i would ever be able to do that .
3981,I was scared the first time I tried a hardflip on my skateboard too. But it's such a rush when you conquer your fear.
3981,"I used to be afraid of dogs, but now I'm studying to be a veterinarian. The only place to do volunteer hours was the dog shelter."
3981,"That's awesome! Sometimes life just pushes you in a certain direction, I guess."
3981,It really does. Just don't push me off a ledge on a bungee cord!  I bet your wife was really proud of you.
3981,She's way crazier than I am. Sometimes it would be nice to relax a little too.
3981,Relaxing is nice. I prefer sight-seeing over adventure vacations. What about you?
3981,I like a a bit of both. Where was the last vacation you took?
3981,A cruise to St. Thomas.  It was relaxing because it wasn't during hurricane season.  What about you?
3981,I went to the amazon for the bungee jumping. It wasn't very relaxing through. Just go go go!
3981,"That must have been so cool to see where they store all those books (ha ha - amazon, get it?)  Seriously, it must have been beauitiful there."
3982,Living in the city is better than most people think. 
3982,Yes it is! I barely sleep though - no rest for the wicked haha!
3982,There is just too much to do! Who needs sleep anyway?
3982,Haha exactly!  I just got food delivered - the steak from Ginos.  At my desk of course but hey - thats what its all about.
3982,Those delivery services sure do come in handy. 
3983,"I went to a concert that played all Jimi Hendrix music, so I was stoked, cuz he's the best! What'd you do?"
3983,"I love Hendrix!  He's from Seattle, just like me!  I visited his grave once."
3983,"That's cool, where is it?"
3983,"I can't remember exactly.  I was pretty young when we went. I remember it was raining, like it always is. Where are you from?"
3983,"lol. You're from seattle, so I'm sure you're used to it, huh? I'm from NY, the big city."
3983,"Oh wow!  I have never been, but would like to go!  I heard the pizza is the best!"
3983,"It definitely is, that's a fact!! Can't get better anywhere. I'm going fishing today at the lake, & plan to stop to get a slice beforehand."
3983,"That sounds great!  I love the outdoors.  I was raised Buddhist, I love meditating outside."
3983,"I was raised Christian, but I love the Buddhist way...it is so zen, peaceful, loving, and void of the noise in this world."
3983,"And what's great is, you can still practice buddhism as a Christian.  Kind of more from a philosophical perspective. "
3983,"Exactly. I used to meditate...no time these days. I'm gonna start making time. I was at such peace and had actual joy. Jesus, he helps me a lot with that!"
3983,"I like Jesus too.  It's a very peaceful religion, and following Christ's teachings can only lead to good things.  A lot like Buddha! :)"
3984,Do you think Goodwill would have any old Guns and Roses records?  That's my favorite group and I collect their records.
3984,"That is certainly a possibility, I have found all sorts of music there."
3984,I have bought a lot of DVDs there and also a beautiful black purse once. 
3984,"Sweet, have you every found anything really valuable for a super cheap price there?"
3984,"Yes, I found a book there once that was rare and I sold it on eBay for over $100!"
3984,It is amazing what treasures people will give away! Do you regularly sell on eBay?
3984,"Yes, I really do!  I buy DVDs and books at Goodwill all the time and sell them on eBay. Fun hobby!"
3984,Sounds like a great hobby. I could see this being an activity I'd do for enjoyment. And also making an extra buck while I'm at it!
3984,"Yes, it really is fun!  I have been selling for over 20 years. "
3984,"Cool, do you ship in recycled boxes or do you buy them new?"
3984,"Because I own a store, eBay give me $25 credit quarterly towards branded bubble bags and boxes, so I get them there."
3984,"You could certainly save some money by reusing shipping boxes, I feel recycling is important and that we throw away too much cardboard."
3985,Sounds so romantic.  I know she loved that
3985,"yes, she did!  I am so excited.  She said yes!"
3985,Congratulations. i know you two will be happy.  Will you plan a big wedding 
3985,"No, I think we are going to go for a smaller wedding.  We'll have it outdoors in the summer."
3985,Sounds romantic.  Outdoors sounds good.  
3985,"/yes, i'm looking forward to it.  where was the last place you went ziplining?"
3985,in ocala
3985,Where is that located?
3985,It's in Florida.  Where did you zipline at last
3985,in hawaii!  at the The Kapohokine.
3985,do you zipline alot
3985,"i wish i could do it more often, but i work three jobs.  It's only on special vacations."
3986,No kindle here. Just hard copy books.
3986,"i have never used a kindle , i love the feel of real paper ."
3986,Do you buy books or get them from a library?
3986,i get my books from the library.
3986,Me too. Not sure why people waste money on books.
3986,I agree.  How do you read?  You can access libraries online such as Cardiff Central Library's mobile library service.
3986,"Yes, I'm aware of Cardiff. I visit the local library and check out a few books a month."
3986,"Sounds nice, I usually browse the physical books and the databases too."
3986,What kind of books do you like to read?
3986,i like to read cook books.
3986,Hmmmm. You must be a great cook then.
3986,yes i am a great cook.
3987,"Yikes! That's a lot of money. I still have to get my wisdom teeth removed, which will cost even more than that."
3987,Yes but that's something that really needs to be done. It's pretty important.
3987,"true, I've been putting it off for too long"
3987,If you're in pain you should probably go ahead and go to the doctor.
3987,"I've had some pain, but it went away. It's unfair some people are lucky enough to not need them removed. Have you had them removed?"
3987,I've had mine removed. It really wasn't that bad. I wish I had done it earlier.
3987,Why's that?
3987,Because I didn't realize how much they were affected.
3987,Were you able to recover quickly?
3987,I was. I really didn't take but a couple of days before I was feeling back to myself.
3987,"That's good to hear! My main issue is I need someone to drive me back from the surgery, but I can only get it done on a weekday."
3987,I was actually able to drive after I had mine done. I didn't go under for the procedure.
3988,It was ok. My mom made me lunch what did you have?
3988,i had salad and pasta
3988,I ate mine outside before I walked into the toilet]
3988,How was that?
3988,"It wasn't so bad, just smelly. How was your day?"
3989,I canceled our plans but didn't really have anywhere else to be.
3989,Why didn't you want to go?
3989,My friend is so unpredictable and the behavior makes me nervous.
3989,That's a good reason to not go with them. What will you do when they ask you to do something another time?
3989,Good question.  What would you do?
3989,I'm not sure. Maybe have a back-up plan to offer as an idea instead. Something where you would be in control of the situation.
3989,"Yeah, that's probably a good way to handle it."
3989,Some people aren't worth the drama.
3989,So true. I like to just go out and relax.  Maybe I just need to hang out with like-minded friends.
3989,That sounds like a plan. Just be kind to the friend you lied to.
3989,"I think I'll just own it, be honest, and see what happens.  Thanks!"
3989,Good for you.  Being honest is important.
3990,What's your favorite? 
3990,I actually really like Tabata protocol. It's a nice mix of cardio and strength training.
3990,"Wow, never heard of that term. Good"
3990,Yeah. It's a type of High Intensity Interval Training developed by a man of that name. It's pretty great.
3990,"I would love to learn more, do you do it on your own or you have a trainer?"
3990,You can do classes for it or you can do it by yourself. It's generally a series of 8 exercises done in four minutes.
3990,"Ok, Thanks for letting me know. My family is not the healthiest and I want to set a better example for my kids."
3990,"Yeah, it's very easy to do at home once you find a good video."
3990,"If you have any good video in mind, forward me please."
3990,"I don't. I do my own thing. You can read more about it and find videos, though."
3990,"ok, Thanks"
3990,"Of course. It doesn't require weights at all, so if you're mostly looking to lose weight and get lean muscle it's a great routine to follow. "
3990,"Ohh, that's awesome."
3991,What kind of car do you own?
3991,I have a BMW SERIES 6
3991,Nice! Can't afford that type. Have an SUV myself.
3991,I love big SUV they can get anywhere and you can tow big toys also.
3991,Exactly. Big toys for me would be jet skis or a boat.
3991,Do you own a brand name Jet Ski? The ones manufactured by kawasaki?
3991,Never owned a jet ski. Only rent them.
3991,"Oh, I see. Well, they are a lot of fun!"
3991,Sure are. I see you manage a restaurant. What kind?
3991,i own a fast food restaurant.
3991,Own one! That's even better.
3991,"I like a fast food restaurant, like packaged form for take-out/take-away. but healthy one"
3992,I am also allergic to shellfish. It makes eating out very frustrating.
3992,"I can't afford to go out very much or eat much shellfish. I have 3 kids to feed too, so we eat a lot of pasta. "
3992,"Well, pasta can be good too! What are your children like? I bet it's hard having three at home!"
3992,They're awesome but a lot of work. We my youngest is such a picky eater too!
3992,"I was like that as well when I was little, but I grew out of it. The secret is to get them to try as many new things as possible."
3992,I end up being a shorter order cook some days. Everyone wants something different. Do you have kids?
3992,"I don't. My job is quite hard work, so I will see what things are like in a few years."
3992,"Oh, what work do you do? I wish I worked outside the home."
3992,I work for a non-profit that aims to help children's services. It can be very challenging. 
3992,"That sounds so rewarding though! I grew up in a trailer park, living with only my mom. Any help was great."
3992,Maybe you have the kind of experience that would be helpful for this kind of work!
3992,Maybe! I never thought about it. I only finished high school when I was young and then had my first kid. But maybe now I can.
3993,I could see that. Headphones do seem more prone to slipping off your head. 
3993,Yeah.  The headphones are more comfortable for non-physical times though. 
3993,Especially when playing games on a computer or console. 
3993,"Definitely!  I always have them on for gaming, with that built in Microphone of course. "
3993,Communicating with others is essential for online gaming. Helps lead to more victories. 
3993,Absolutely.  Plus a little trash-talking haha.  I have a nice pair of red wireless headphones. Red is favorite color. What's yours? 
3993,"Red is a good choice, mine is blue."
3993,Also a great color!  DO you use the noise cancelling headphones?  Really helps with the game immersion. 
3993,"Always prefer to use noise cancelling, helps eliminate background noise which means others can hear me more clearly. "
3993,"Haha, yeah, and it conveniently keeps me from hearing my wife telling me to take out the trash :) "
3993,LOL! Yet another good reason to use them!
3993,ANd excellent on flights if you are seated near a crying kid or something
3993,That seems to happen every time I travel by air. 
3994,what other scary movies do you like?
3994,It's not really scary. It's a comedy.
3994,"oh, i didn't know that.  When was the last time you watched it?"
3994,I've watched it many times. The last time was a few months ago.
3994,did you eat any snacks when you watched it?
3994,I think I ate popcorn. I like that a lot.
3994,"i like popcorn when it's covered in cheese. and doritos and ice cream, not together, but whenever i watch movies."
3994,That sounds good. Do you like to watch sports on tv?
3994,i love to watch rugby and sometimes march madness
3994,I've watched rugby a few times. It's a tough sport. I watch a lot of football and baseball.
3994,do you ever go to watch the games live?
3994,I've watched the St. Louis Cardinals several times at Busch stadium.
3995,"I know, I've been taking my mind off it doing things I enjoy, but it's not working so well lately."
3995,It will take time. Allow yourself to grieve and take it a day at a time.
3995,"I guess so, thank you. Do you have anythig you enjoy doing when your mind is wandering?"
3995,I like to paint to take my mind off of things.
3995,"Ah that's nice, what do you paint? Anything in particular?"
3995,Usually abstract artwork. Do you like to paint?
3995,"That's cool! Abstract is interesting for sure - I don't paint, but I enjoy singing & watching films mostly."
3995,That's fun! What are some of your favorite films?
3995,"Magic Mike is my all time favourite, bizarre I know haha. Generally films with some fun, but I'll watch anything. You?"
3995,"Haha I've never actually seen Magic Mike! I like scary movies, the original Halloween is one of my favorites."
3995,"That's good for sure, I'm a big fan of horror as a genre. Very fitting with this time of year too. Is that a Haloween staple?"
3995,I think it is for sure. Do you like this time of year?
3995,"Yeah I love Autumn, my favourite season and holidays. You?"
3996,Oh ok. So do you like Armadillos?
3996,"Yes, they are very cute. They're common here in Texas. Have you seen a live one before?"
3996,"Yes, actually I see them quite often. How about your self?"
3996,"I used to, but I recently moved to a large city. I miss living in a rural area and seeing lots of animals!"
3996,Yes it's pretty relaxing. I just moved to a large city my self in Texas.
3996,"How do you like it? I've lived in or near 3 of the cities, I would prefer to live somewhere greener..."
3996,"I love it. My son loves it also, He's going to school down here."
3996,"That's great to hear! The weather is very nice this time of year, I will admit. When it's behaving, anyway."
3996,Texas weather right lol. There's also many different thing to do and see in Texas.
3996,"yes, although I wish there was a little more nature scenery, like big mountains and forests. Have you been to the Riverwalk in San Antonio?"
3996,"Yes that would be nice. Yes I have been there, great experience."
3996,"There are some really good restaurants there, I used to live very close and would go for runs along it."
3997,What song is being discussed?
3997,"Breaking Ben and 5 finger...I am proposing tonight, and I am going to play that song"
3997,"Excellent! Never heard of the song, but you must be super excited about tonight."
3997,"Thank you!  Big time! A little nervous, but optimistic!  :)  It should be a surprise to her too"
3997,Surprises are the best kind? Wondering... did you ask her father for permission?
3997,"I did, I guess Im a little old fashioned haha.  I graduated College last week with no debt, so he was proud of me for that."
3997,Wow! Seems like you know what you want. Good head on your shoulders. No school debt - that's unheard of these days.
3997,Thank you!  We have a scholarship program in my state.  Did you go to College? 
3997,I went to a Community College for two years. Graduated with honors in business. I was working FT then entire time. Tough!
3997,"Now that's respectable!  SO many people go to college with no plan, and rack up debt. Sad!"
3997,"Yes, it is sad. Hopefully more schools will be free in the future."
3997,Absolutely.  ANd many more scholarships too.  
3998,What are some of your favorite memories from then?
3998,I think the innocence of it all - life gets a lot more boring when you have to be responsible and not so oblivious haha
3998,"I understand, everything was simpler and more black and white, unlike the world once grown."
3999,I have been applying to a few places but no one has asked me for an interview.
3999,Good luck! Don't give up and you'll get something great!
3999,Thank you! I need to get a better job so I can buy better food for my Iguanas.
3999,That's a cool pet! I recommend listening to opera before interviews. It is my favorite!
3999,That is an interesting idea. I bet opera would be soothing. Do you listen to a lot of opera?
3999,It is the only thing I listen to actually. I enjoy eating steak while listening to the great sounds of opera.
3999,My friend said she had steak last night. I told her I was jealous and wanted some too. She wouldn't bring me any.
3999,Bummer! You should have a steak for dinner! How do you like it cooked?
3999,Medium with some pink in the middle. How about you?
3999,I like it totally rare! The rarer the better!
3999,There is a steak that is just seared on all sides. I forget what it is called though.
3999,That sounds delicious! Thanks for the suggestion! I wish you look in your job search!
3999,Thank you and it was nice talking with you!
4000,I really wish it had gone on for a few more seasons. 
4000,i am okay with it ending.  i really only liked jon snow's story line.  there are way too many characters to keep up with.
4000,The ending was fine but seemed a bit rushed. 
4000,how do you mean?
4000,It seemed as though they were trying to get it over with instead of fleshing out more details. 
4000,i think they are normally incredibly detailed.  i wonder what made them rush it.
4000,"I think the directors have a deal with Disney to make a Star Wars series, could be why they rushed. "
4000,i have watched a few of the new star wars movies.  i have been enjoying them.
4000,"Same here, also looking forward to episode 9 coming out in December. "
4000,i'm excited for the ending.  I wonder what will happen.
4000,I'm sure there will be a huge twist.
4000,i'm an artist myself so i always enjoy seeing how these directors make their films
4001,That's interesting. Have you ever played hockey or baseball?
4001,"I have, but only a few times.  It's fast-paced and physical.  Fun to watch!"
4001,Agreed! What else do you like to do?
4001,I play blackjack.  But my favorite all time is Texas Hold Em
4001,Oh cool. I've never played poker. Is it hard to learn?
4001,There are some really good YouTube video tutorials. You can find just about anything there.
4001,Good to know. I've always wanted to learn
4001,"It's fun. I mostly play with friends for ""fun"" but sometimes I play online for cash."
4001,Cool. Do you win a lot doing that or does it just depend?
4001,"I budget a certain amount I'm willing to lose each  month - and when I lose it, I stop playing til the next month. "
4001,Nice. That's a good plan
4001,I figure I can blow it having fun that way or blow it some other way. I usually come out close to even.
4002,"My dog certainly did like retrieving things! I'm not into hunting, but she would bring me lots of sticks and balls!"
4002,I have a dog also. She loves to chase a ball.
4002,What kind of dog is she?
4002,She's a golden retriever.
4002,My dog always complains when I'm on the computer playing games though. She always wants to go for a walk when I'm in the middle of a quest!
4002,My dog wants to go for a walk every day. She will bug me til we go! Then she settles down.
4002,"To be honest, my dog is the only reason I get exercise some days."
4002,"Me, too. Another good reason to have a dog!"
4002,Now if only my dog could help me get a date as well!
4002,It could happen. Go to where there are other dog lovers.
4002,Good idea! Maybe I can convince my coworker...fingers crossed!
4002,"Ok, it's worth a try. What kind of work do you do?"
4003,"I have a blue motorcycle, I like to ride it on the weekends!"
4003,Oh that's sweet!  My motorcycle is black!
4003,"Oh cool, you ride?  I swear, it is therapy!  I feel so chilled out after a nice long ride. "
4003,"Yes, I ride mine to work and also cruising the back roads on the weekends!"
4003,"Sweet!  I have one bike, but would like to get another. I collect vintage cars, so I may look for a trade. "
4003,That sounds like a great idea!  I hope you can work that out.
4003,I think it will definitely.  I kind of run in those circles of collectors and traders. I'd like to get a Harley one day.   
4003,Cool!  Did you know they have been making Harleys since 1903?
4003,"Yes, thats one of the reasons I want one. I love the history!  "
4003,"Yes, they are really nicely built motorcycles!"
4003,And they hold their value...and in most case INCREASE value over time. Wise investment!
4003,"Yes, very true!  Great investment!  Well, I've got to go sell some insurance!  Great chatting!"
4004,Yes! I am so excited. I have been working really hard driving freight trucks to save up the money.
4004,There is something so satisfying having key in hand and walking in knowing that this is yours and you earned it!
4004,Absolutely! I already picked out pink furniture to match my pink hair.
4004,Pink is one of my favorite colors! Your color theme will be very colorful then.
4004,Do you own your own home? what is your color scheme?
4004,"I live in a condo, my color scheme is sienna, creamy yellow and an olive color green."
4004,I had a condo a few years ago. It's nice to not have to mow a lawn!
4004,"Yes, indeed it is!  I have a deck where I can place colorful flowers, and I don't have to weed!!"
4004,I love flowers! What is your favorite flower?
4004,Tulips and magnolia's are my favorite. But for my deck I choose colorful begonias and impatiens.
4004,That sounds like a lovely setting and view. 
4004,"Yes, it is my She-deck. LOL  What are your favorite flowers?"
4005,I think everyone loves singing someway or another!
4005,i decided to audition for a talent show recently
4005,"I remember one time one of my brothers auditioned for a talent show, he came back home crying."
4005,he didn't get accepted?
4005,"He failed miserably, I told him he did good though."
4005,"that's funny.  i was accepted, but i think i am too shy to go"
4005,Why not? This could be a one time opportunity. I have so many regrets where I was too shy.
4005,it could be.  just the thought of all those people watching me makes me sick.
4005,"I remember being too shy to talk to one girl, been regretting it ever since. "
4005,do you still know her?
4005,"Nah, we cut ties. Now I'm constantly looking for the next opportunity."
4005,"never stop trying, there are plenty of fish in the sea!"
4006,"Wow, that's impressive! I like to ride them casually but I couldn't dedicate myself like her."
4006,"Yes, horses are a lot of work. And they all have such different personalities and temperaments. Like big dangerous dogs."
4006,"Absolutely, I think it depends on where in the world the horse has been grown. Where are you from?"
4006,"I am from Oregon originally, but grew up in Texas. Yourself?"
4006,"Ah my girlfriend is from Texas, I don't blame you for moving haha. I'm originally Argentinian but my family and I moved to the UK"
4006,That's really cool! Do you prefer Argentina or the UK more?
4006,"I can sort of remember Argentina, but I'd definitely be considered more English - my memories were lovely though! I'd like to travel back there. Do you travel?"
4006,"No, but only due to lack of money. I would love to visit other countries, it's just expense and I don't know how visas work."
4006,"Yeah I understand that, money is a real problem nowadays. Yo ucould always travel to other states though! I've heard Washington is nice"
4006,"Yes, I have vague plans to do that. Washington does seem nice, Colorado is especially beautiful too."
4006,"Oh absolutely, the West Coast of America looks beautiful as a whole, especailly compared to Eastern England haha"
4006,Really? Whats Eastern England like?
4007,I like rock
4007,I am more of a country music fan than rock.
4007,What do you like to do for fun?
4007,"Watch tv, play video games, go to the beach.  What about you?"
4007,"I like to spend time walking dogs, play video games, watch tv"
4007,"What kinds of tv shows do you like? I watch a lot of old re-runs, but I like some of the new shows, too."
4007,I like all sorts of shows. A lot of 90s shows. Masked Singer is my current obsession.What about you?
4007,I like the doctor shows like New Amsterdam and the Good Doctor.  I also enjoy shows like Amazing Race.
4007,I haven't gotten into Amazing Race. Big Brother is something I am into though
4007,"Oh cool, I've never watched that one before!"
4007,It is amazing because it practically happens live!
4007,so no weird editing? I used to watch the Bachelor but that got too weird.
4007,"Some weird editing, but there are also live feeds which helps with some of that.  I quit the bachelor years ago because of a lot of things."
4008,Yea...I really miss her.
4008,I can understand. I really miss my mom.
4008,If you don't mind my asking...what happened? 
4008,She passed away from cancer last year.
4008,I'm really sorry to hear that. I lost my mom when I was 18 to a car accident. Stupid drunk driver.
4008,"Oh no, that's horrible. I'm so sorry. Was anybody else in the car?"
4008,"No it was just her. She was on her way to sign paperwork for her restaurant opening, "
4008,Oh really? My mom ran a restaraunt for awhile. 
4008,Wow no way! I opened my own restaurant 3 years after my mom died
4008,"What do you serve? My mom served a lot of things with kale, my kids and I always loved her food."
4008,I serve southern comfort foods!
4008,Oooh my eight year old would love your restaurant. She loves southern food.
4009,What kind of movies do you like?
4009,"I like all kinds of movies really.  I would say I enjoy horror movies the least, not because of the ""horror,"" but because the plots are pretty bad."
4009,Lol your right the plots are bad. I watch those mostly with my eyes closed
4009,"Haha.  Yeah, the plots are quite frustrating sometimes.  What kind of movies do you like?"
4009,Dramas amd I really liked Breaking Bad but that was a TV show not a movie.
4009,"Nice.  Yeah, I love tv shows too.  I really liked Breaking Bad. I watch a bunch of shows too"
4009,Not sure of the name of the movie with Bruce Willis but I see dead people was good
4009,Lol.  The Sixth Sense
4009,Right. That is about as scary as I can handle
4009,"But that's a ""scary"" movie with a good plot"
4009,It sure had a surprise ending that's for sure
4009,"Yeah, that was a great movie.  I would recommend The Witch as another good movie.  It's nowhere near as scary as the title would suggest."
4010,Yes!  You just hold your nose while you sing in the shower!  I do it all the time and it works!  
4010,the common cold ! that is what i found the cure for !
4010,You did?  What is your cure?
4010,Just standard cold medicine! 
4010,"Oh, I thought you were talking about something else!  Standard cold medicine helps a lot though."
4010,What else would I be talking about? Are you calling me a liar?
4010,"No, not calling you a liar.  "
4010,I'm a well known scientist. You can believe me. 
4010,"Okay, I do believe you!  "
4010,There's no reason to patronize me.
4010,I am not patronizing you.  I really do believe you!
4010,"Sorry, lol, either way, thanks. You have a great day or night or whatever it is!"
4011,Nachos are definitely my favorite!  The spicier the better!
4011,I used to love nachos before I became vegan. But I sure do love spicy food!
4011,"Yes!  I'm a bit of a ""hot head"" haha. Is it tough to be Vegan?"
4011,It was really hard at first but with time you find your favorites and it's not too bad. I did it for the environment.
4011,I wonder if there are Vegan nacho options?
4011,"Not really because of the cheese. There is a vegan cheese, but I don't like it. Do you eat meat?"
4011,I do.  I make chilli for my D and D group every week.  We have contests on who can make the best.
4011,That is a fun themed contest! I wish we had something like that that I could ride my bike to.
4011,"You sound like you have a very healthy lifestyle!  I'd like to start riding my bike more, and work off these nachos haha"
4011,Biking riding is one of favorite activities. I prefer it to driving to help save the planet.
4011,"That's also a great reason, despite the health benefits.  "
4011,"Health is really important to me. Nothing better than feeling good, right?"
4012,the first thing i'm going to do is buy a ticket to my favorite band's concert and dance so hard
4012,You earned it! Feels great to celebrate by doing something fun like that. Who is your favorite band?
4012,it's coheed and cambria and they have a big concert coming up
4012,I wish Coldplay or Ed Sheeran would come someplace close for me to see. Or better yet Michael Buble
4012,where is that?
4012,"Oh Nashville, Cincinnati or Indianapolis would be close enough to road trip. They are so worth it!"
4012,nashville is a fun town!
4012,"Yes, I should spend more time exploring there. Not much of a country music fan, however."
4012,"i don't mind country music, but nashville has a lot to offer.  especially great food!"
4012,What is your favorite place to eat while visiting Nashville?
4012,pemrose!
4012,What type of food is at Pemrose?
4013,"That is true, however it does help that I have the sound of running water to cover the bad high tones of my singing voice!"
4013,"Haha, I'm the same way. You won't catch me singing anywhere else."
4013,"karaoke bar would be the best place, I do not drink myself so I find that the shower is the best way for me to let it out."
4014,Are there any malls around where you live?
4014,"There's one not too far away, about a 5 minute drive. I work there, actually, and it's quite nice, moderately big too. You?"
4014,There is a big mall in a town about 20 miles away. I love going there to shop. 
4014,"Ah that's grand, do you have anything you like to shop in particular?"
4014,I just enjoy the experience. I mostly window shop. 
4014,"Ahh I do the same, although that's mainly down to a lack of money. Would be nice, but who knows what the future will be "
4014,That's right.  I like exercising also. Do you workout or exercise?
4014,"I go gym, not so much sports. I wanna build a physique and I like the time to myself. What kind of exercise do you do?"
4014,I do yoga and exercise classes at the gym. I like acrobatic stuff because I used to be a cheerleader.
4014,"Ahh I see, that's really good cardio for certain. I'd like to have done gymnastics, but weights will have to do for now. Do you enjoy it?"
4014,"Yeah , I really enjoy yoga, and I just like staying fit and limber."
4014,"That's good, your body will thank you for it 30 years down the line."
4015,I do. I really enjoy college football. 
4015,"I watch it as well, but I really enjoy watching basketball"
4015,Oh nice. Did you ever play basketball?
4015,I do play basketball sometimes
4015,That's fun. Do you play any other sports?
4015,"I sometimes do a little racing, I have a sweet collection of cars that I like to take out from time to time."
4015,Oh wow. How long have you been into collecting cars?
4015,"Every since I could drive. I still have my first, a 79 Camaro."
4015,Do you ever travel long distances in your cars?
4015,"Rarely in my nice ones, unless I am traveling to a car show."
4015,Do you go to car shows frequently?
4015,"Not lately , but from time to time when i have the extra cash i do ."
4016,I have two younger sisters. We like to binge watch Netflix together.
4016,What show do you binge on Netflix?
4016,We just finished watching Lucifer. Next is Outlander. Do you have any shows you're addicted to?
4016,Yes I binge on Luke Cage
4016,oh I've seen that one too. I do like superhero shows too.
4016,"I really like Batman too, Christian Bale is my favorite Batman."
4016,I agree. He had the right amount of darkness in him. I am looking forward to the Joker movie.
4016,No one played a better Joker than Heath Ledger
4016,I have to agree with that as well. It still makes me sad that Heath is gone.
4016,Yes it really is too bad he died at such a young age.
4016,Now I have to check if that Batman movie is streaming on Netflix! Burritos and movies tonight!
4016,Ok I have to get back to work will check on Netflix later.
4017,whats your favorite kind of cake?
4017,German Chocolate is the best
4017,Do you have any other favorite cakes?
4017,Anything with chocolate frosting. How about you?
4017,I love carrot cake myself. I'm not really a big fan of birthday cake though
4017,I would make carrot cakes but I always end uo giving my horses the carrots
4017,What kinds of horses do you have?
4017,"I have a little bit of everything it see,s including mini ponies. I have 14 horses and ponies"
4017,Thats so cool! I love horses. My favorite horses are quarter horses
4017,Quarter Horses are real popular where I live but I like to ride gaited horses.
4017,How long have you had horses?
4017,At least 20 yrs but now days I just rescue the old abused horses and let them live out their lives just eating.
4018,That's interesting. I'm the army.
4018,Really? That's interesting. What is your job?
4018,I'm a ranger. I took the job because I would be honored to give my life for my country.
4018,Thank you for your service. How long have you been a ranger?
4018,Not too long. What kinds of insects do you study?
4018,"wax worms , night crawlers , minos what ever"
4018,Night crawlers are supposedly good for fishing.
4018,"yes , they come out at night and stay by the waters ."
4018,That would make it easy to fish early in the morning.
4018,"yes , and greater for nature i would think"
4018,Yeah that is a good point.
4018,true . what is on your agenda for this evening ?
4018,Video games and spending time with my husband.
4019,"Yeah, but I wanted to go to the lake today."
4019,What do you like to do on the lake?
4019,"we take the boat out during the day, and then at night we make a bonfire."
4019,That sounds like great fun. I love camping.
4019,Sometimes the kids pitch a tent when the weather is nice. I've just been working so much lately and was really hoping to get out today.
4019,Aww yeah. I haven't been camping in a while either. I miss scaring the other campers with my imitation bird calls.
4019,"haha, I bet that's fun. How did you learn to do bird calls?"
4019,Learned from my grandpa who was an avid outdoorsy guy. 
4019,That's really nice. I miss my grandpa.  Grandparents are such a blessing.
4020,That sounds delicious! I've found a lot of new recipes that don't contain meat. Do you like to cook?
4020,"Im not very good at it, but would like to learn more. I like going to the beach and roasting smores on the campfire, if that counts as cooking haha"
4020,I think it counts! That sounds very relaxing. Do you live near the beach?
4020,"I do, my job keeps me close to the beach.  So I love my job.  Where are you from?  "
4020,"I'm from the Midwest, so nowhere near a beach. "
4020,I suppose you have some nice lakes though!
4020,We sure do! I live pretty close to one so we go fishing pretty often
4020,Excellent!  I love fishing!  And love to eat fish.  Saltwater and freshwater!
4020,Nice! What else do you like to do?
4020,"Anything outdoorsy.  Lately, I have been trying to learn to surf.  Im getting better at it, but still have a ways to go! "
4020,"Wow, that sounds tough. I'm terrible at balance so I don't think I could ever learn to surg!"
4020,"Oh, you could try boogie boarding.  Less balance involved, and still a ton of fun!"
4021,That's silly. I think it's fine for guys to get counseling.
4021,It makes me feel good to know someone out their understands my feelings.
4021,I like to take time out to empathize wiith others when I'm not trying to learn French.
4021,That's interesting because I took French in school.  I can't speak much now though.  Perhaps learning a new language may help lift my depression.
4021,"It might! I've been taking online courses for it, since I spend a lot of time online anyway."
4021,Online classes are great.  I took a few of them before I started writing childrens books.
4021,Maybe you could write a childrens book that's symbolic for coping with depression.
4021,That is such a good idea!  I will definitely be working on that!  Maybe I could get you to translate it into french as well.
4021,Hopefully I'm well versed enough in French by then.
4021,I'm sure you are.  Before those kids know it they'd be speaking another language.  I wish I had learned a language that early on.
4021,It's never too late. Using my computer so much has taught me you can basically do anything online.
4021,Indeed. I've always enjoyed computers. Mostly the games that are played on them though.
4021,I'm actually going to go play a game right now. See you later!
4022,My brothers work with me so it is so much fun
4022,how many brothers do you have?
4022,3. Do you have any siblings?
4022,"no, i wish i did.  I love to play football and it would be nice to have someone to play with."
4022,We played football all the time. What did you do in the military?
4022,i worked on airplanes.
4022,What did you do on airplanes?
4022,"i was a mechanic, i fixed them"
4022,That's awesome. I've always loved planes.
4022,do you travel often?
4022,no because I work 
4022,do you work too much?
4023,Well it would suggest that you are young in heart and mind! I am a 34 year old dad. Do you have children?
4023,"Not right now, and maybe it's a little too late for me haha. But I've always been thinking of adopting, how do you find being a parent?"
4023,"hmm to be honest, its amazing to see a little me running about. My parents are really helpful. why do you think its too late?"
4023,"My parents had me when they were 20, so I feel like a grandma in comparison lol. That seems nice, I'd be worried about losing my free time though."
4023,"I believe its a choice you end up making, for example I used to spend time in male beauty pageants, which stoped when we had Owen"
4023," Ahh that's interesting! Was that your own choice or were you guided to do it by others? I've not been in paegents, but I do love the beach."
4023,"where is your favourite beach? It was a choice to start a family yes, but spending time on something new"
4023,"Hmm, that's a tough one. I live in a medium-sized city, so it's tough to go locally, but there's one 3 hours away by car I love to relax at."
4023,Do you get to spend time there often? or does the city always stop you from really getting back out there?
4023,"I often try to go once a month when work isn't too busy, and I'll spend a weekend there. It's very therapeutic. Do you relax much?"
4023,"I do try to, my favourite way to relax is with rollerblading however I hardly get time to do it these days. I do however love the papers"
4023,"Yeah reading is good, as is rollerblading! Do you read the tabloids or do you try for more objective newspapers?"
4024,Thanks! I will tell her all about my work at the animal shelter.
4024,I'm glad you can do what you're passionate about.  What kinds of animals do you rescue?
4024,"Mostly dogs and cats, but we have some birds and reptiles too. What do you do for work?"
4024,"I'm a wedding planner, it's an awesome job."
4024,That must be so fun! Always working with new people and locations.
4024,"Yes, and it's an amazing feeling to see someone fall in love with your vision."
4024,That's really romantic. Do you ever have French clients? I speak French.
4024,"Some. Mostly in tourist areas I imagine. I'll try to learn some of the language, though, to make it easier"
4024,That would really widen your client base if you spoke multiple languages. Good for you to learn!
4024,thanks! :)
4024,I should start talking to the animals at the shelter in french so they learn commands in french!
4024,Yes I think that's a great idea.
4025,"I did, but they weren't very helpful."
4025,Have you considered getting a tutor to help you?
4025,I haven't looked into it very much. I'm worried it'll be too expensive or time consuming.
4025,Maybe your school can help you find a tutor that won't be too expensive
4025,That's not a bad idea. I'll have to look into it.
4025,I'm sure it will be helpful
4025,"Yeah, I can't afford to fail it again."
4025,I'm sure you will be okay! Do you take any other difficult classes?
4025,Right now its just calculus for me. I'm working hard because I want to set a good example for the kid back home.
4025,That's very noble of you. At least you can concentrate on just the one class
4025,"Yeah, you're right. I've already taken it twice so I also have an idea as to how it works already."
4025,That's good. I'm sure the teacher will appreciate how hard you're working
4026,I love museums!
4026,"Me, too! My boyfriend just took me to the new Magritte museum last week."
4026,"Awesome.  I work a lot of hours in a doctors office, but when I get some free time, museums are a go-to"
4026,"I spend a lot of time at museums. I think my new boyfriend might be a little jealous, lol."
4026,I am too haha. I love all kinds of art. Even body art. I got thorns tattoed on my toes
4026,That's pretty cool. I've never really thought about toe tattoos. 
4026,Kind of a good spot for me. There is still a bit of a stigma with tats. And I have to keep them out of sire for my job.
4026,"I think the stigma around them is pretty silly, unless they're obviously offensive designs."
4026,"Yeah for sure.  It seems like some of the older clients that come in, may feel that its a cleanliness issue. My boos doesn't mind them though. "
4026,Your boss sounds way more interesting than your clients!
4026,Hahah
4026,Hopefully tattoos become less stigmatized over time. Especially for people who are being rejected for jobs because of theirs.
4027,"I don't really care much for working. My parents were the same way, but we still managed to make ends meet somehow."
4027,I have no choice but to work but I enjoy my job and the people I work with.
4027,That's good to hear. Maybe working is more bearable when you're surrounded by people you like. What do you do?
4027,I do auto claims. What kind of hobbies do you have?
4027,"Sometimes I garden, I'm trying to grow some of my own fruits and vegetables. You?"
4027,I wish I had a green thumb. I have horses so I spend my free time with them
4027,"Wow, I can't imagine what it's like to own horses. I take it you own lot of land?"
4027,I have more horses then land but have 10 acres 14 horses so that is why I have to work.
4027,"Well I'm sure the horses appreciate the work you do for them in their own way, haha."
4027,I do enjoy watching them run around in the pasture.
4027,Do you have names for all of them?
4027,They have names but sometimes I forget what they are lol. 
4027,Haha well tell them all I said hey lol.
4027,thank you ! i sure will .
4028,I try to save the world lol. What do you do for fun?
4028,"Well, I love the new technology and how I can "
4028,what's your favorite part of technology?
4028,i love technology it moves fast
4028,Fast is good. I'm on the keto diet so I can physically move fast
4028,Really? Thats the high fat low carb diet?
4028,it is and I really enjoy it. It has made such a difference
4028,I like how it forces the body to burn fats
4028,Exactly. What do you do for work?
4028,"I work in IT, what about you?"
4028,"My father and grandfather worked in the circus, but I decided to go into education as a college professor"
4028,"man thats awesome, i have a friend who is in that field and its very interesting"
4029,I feel like they must have. I hate it when the trailer gives away the whole movie.
4029,I do too. The trailers are supposed to make you want to see the movie not spoil everything.
4029,"Exactly! I do feel like it must be a difficult line to walk though, trying to make it interesting without giving things away."
4029,Yeah I agree. But then again they just do what they think the public wants to see.
4029,I suppose you're right. Have you seen any movies lately that weren't terrible?
4029,Not really. I've mostly watched things on Netflix. They added a new series called Living with yourself that was good.
4029,"I saw the ad for that, it looked pretty interesting. What's it about?"
4029,"A guy is upset with the life he has and visits a ""life changing"" spaw. The spa is into cloning and disposing of the originals."
4030,"I thought it was about due, but I try not to expect things like that."
4030,It would be nice if i got a raise working at this hectic coffee shop
4030,What exactly do you do there?
4030,I blend and serve different coffee to the customers
4030,I suppose that you make up for the lack of a raise by getting good tips.
4030,You would be surprised by how many people do not tip.
4030,"That's terrible. Tips , like raises,  help you feel rewarded for a job well done."
4030,I agree but try telling my boss and the patrons that.
4030,You would think that if people want good service they would tip. It must make you less enthusiastic about your work.
4030,It gets to me sometimes but it beats unemployment I'm thankful to have a job
4030,That is a very rational and sensible way to look at it.  What is your educational background?
4030,High school graduate and a little bit of college.
4031,its a subway system around here
4031,Gotcha. We don't really have any public transportation around here
4031,Is it difficult to get around?
4031,Not really. I have a truck that I drive everywhere but I'm sure a bus or subway would be nice
4031,It is! It's nice to be able to settle in with a good book. 
4031,I love to read as well. What's your favorite book?
4031,"My favorite is a history-based book called To Live, but right now I'm mostly reading books on botany. What about you?"
4031,That's interesting. I'm not reading anything right now but I love true crime books
4031,I used to love watching crime TV shows. They're super cool!
4031,"I think so, too! I think it's very interesting"
4031,"I once considered becoming a crime investigator, but I didn't like the ties to science."
4031,I understand that. I think it can be very difficult to become a crime investigator and it takes a long time
4032,what happened to him?
4032,He did some crazy things and got in trouble with the law.  So sad.  
4032,what other country music do you like?
4032,DOwn here in Tennessee it's all country music all the time.  SO I like everything from classic to contemporary.
4032,do you live near nashville?
4032,My husband works in Nashville and we are only a short drive away.  Have you ever been here?
4032,i went there on a work trip and ate the most delicious cheesecake.
4032,DO you travel often for work?
4032,"yes, i go to a lot of conferences"
4032,"I hope they are the interesting kind of conferences, not too boring and dull.  "
4032,i always find them fascinating
4032,It is good that you enjoy what you do.  Where do you work?
4033,"Yes, I have a brother and a sister."
4033,That's cool.  Always cherish your relationships.  My sister passed not too long ago.
4033,I'm sorry to hear that. How old was she?
4033,She was 24.  Ever since she passed I donate blood monthly.  It changed my life.
4033,I bet. I used to donate blood but can't do it anymore. I lived in Europe in the 90's when I was in the army.
4033,That's interesting.  I'm just a waitress here in Houson.  How long were you in the army and for which country?
4033,I was in the US Army for 19 years.
4033,That's awesome.  I have a lot of family in the Navy.  I'm kind of the only one in the family that didn't go into the service.
4033,That's cool. My dad was in the Navy during World War II.
4034,"I do speak to her a lot, we have a mini book club where we swap good books to read. Do you have children/?"
4034,"That's good! A great way to stay connected. I don't have any kids currently, my job takes up a lot of my time after being fired."
4034,"I'm sorry to hear that, are you currently looking for new employment? did you like your previous job?"
4034,"It's all good! I did work at a newspaper agency, but it went under. I had to move from upstate, but now I'm working at a bank. You?"
4034,"I actually work in a university as a librarian. I love books so its perfect for me. I'm glad you have found work, do you enjoy it?"
4034,"Yeah I do! It's a bit lonely, but nothing like an empty nest. Libraries and their staff are very valuable. What're your favourite books?"
4034,"Wow now that is a question, I do love Stephen King novels, horror isn't usually my favourite genre to relax to. Do you read books often?"
4034,"Not as much as I used to, but I'm a fan of King's too! Lately I've been more into non-fiction and learning about history of things, it's interesting for certain."
4034,"Wow a history buff, what is your favourite period to read about? mine if the classics such as the Roman & Greek period"
4034,"Ahh apologies, I wrote that poorly! It's less history itself, more histories of things instead. For example, a book on a Japanese wrestling promotion's crime-riddled origins!"
4034,"Ah I see, do you enjoy the manga comics? Sorry I am not 100 percent I have a lot of knowledge about them"
4034,"No it's okay I understand! Yeah they have manga characters too, the book touches on that! Do you dabble in non-fiction, or are you more into fantasy worlds?"
4035,"If I'm being honest, I don't feel very supported right now. "
4035,I'm sorry to hear that. Why is that?
4035,"Well, I went on welfare last month and I've been incredibly overwhelmed."
4035,I'm so sorry. I'm sure that is a difficult situation
4035,Yeah. That's why I really do appreciate the little help that I do get.
4035,I'm sure. I try to give back to the community when I can
4035,"That's admirable. I used to do that more, but now I'm struggling just trying to support myself."
4035,I understand. It's important to support yourself before you can help others
4035,"I wish that I could do more, though."
4035,"Yes, that's all we can do. Keep trying to do better in life, and help others."
4035,That's a good saying to live by.
4035,I hope your situation improves!
4036,"It can be hard to follow the action sometimes because it's so fast paced, but it's still awesome"
4036,"Yeah, Some days are longer in the office than others, Gosh its so stressful."
4036,What do you do for a living?
4036,"Well, I am a stock broker so i spend long hours, watching screens and adding and subtracting number.and talking to ppl of course."
4036,"Sounds interesting. I'm out of work myself. I help my mom mainly, she cares for my grandmother and needs all the help she can get."
4036,"it can be stressful at times , hah . what do you do for fun ? i like to sing."
4036,"Actually, singing is one thing I like to do as well. "
4036,good job! maybe you should pursue a singing career :) help your mom and your grandma out when things get better ya know?
4036,yeah that would be awesome. i should go do karaoke or something
4036,whoooooo karaoke night tommorow ! would you believe that's huge in china! they treat it almost like a sport!
4036,"I wish it was here too! Would be an awesome ""sport"" to be a part of"
4036,I do like to watch it in the olympics or sure though! haha
4037,no problem. How about your dad?
4037,My dad is great! He love Prince as much as I do we listen to Purple Rain a lot.
4037,Oh that is fun. I do not like Prince that much. 
4037,Really? Who is your favorite musician?
4037,My favorite musician is Eminem
4037,Great choice! I love Gloria estefan because she bilungual like me. 
4037,Oh i am also bilingual. I can speak fluent Italian
4037,Wow that language is tough! I'm so impressed! How old were you when you learned it?
4037,I learned it in Italy and kept practicing for 5 years. 
4037,I would love to visit Italy some day. I imagine the food is superb?
4037,I have never been. I do love Italian food in America though.
4037,Can't beat American food. Burgers and fries are my favorite. This is making me hungry!
4038,"Yes, I asked it in a joking way in order to keep the conversation friendly."
4038,Well that still makes you a great friend!
4038,Well I don't feel like one in this moment.
4038,I understand. Those situations are tough
4038,Very. I don't want to hold a grudge about it though. How's everything with you?
4038,Understandable. I'm good. I am relaxing on a nice easy day off from work.
4038,Cool! What line of work are you in if you don't mind me asking?
4038,I work in higher education.  What about you?
4038,I'm studying law.
4038,"Ah, that's cool. I heard law school is super competitive."
4038,"Very and the work load can be grueling, but I know that it will all pay off in the long run."
4038,I'm sure it will. I've seen so many success stories with my students after they graduate
4038,Thanks. I hope everything works out for you also. Thanks for the pep talk lol.
4039,"Yes definitely ""out"""
4039,Yeah that man's ego is through the roof.
4039,I believe he is what is called a narcissist...
4039,"Yeah that's spot on, I'm kind of mindblown he was ever elected to begin with."
4039,"I am too!!! We have the 2020 election coming up, hopefully this is his last turn. He has divided the country so much."
4039,"I wonder if people that voted for him wish they hadn't, or if most of them are sticking to their guns about him being a good president."
4039,I wonder the same. Not sure how in the world anyone in their right mind could listen to him and think he is good for our country.
4039,I agree. I can't understand how his supporters don't see it! I guess they don't WANT to see it!
4039,Turning a blind eye and ear for sure. To me it is so obvious that he is only out for himself.
4039,"Glad to see at least someone knows what they're talking about.  Nice chatting, gotta go now."
4039,Thanks same here.
4039,"OKay, have a good day!"
4040,I like a lot of cheese on mine
4040,I've been ordering pizza with extra cheddar and mushrooms. It is pretty good. What is your stance on pineapple on pizza?
4040,I like my pineapple on the side because some places will cook it and I'm not a fan of cooked pineapple.
4040,I gotcha. I liked the cooked pineapple personally. I put it with pepperoni.
4040,Of couse anything goes good with pepperoni
4040,"That is very true. California Pizza Kitchen has a good pizza called a Thai chicken pizza. It's a white sauce, chicken, carrots, and sprouts."
4040,Oh wow that sounds so good just never heard of it. What other types of food do you like?
4040,"I'm all over the place. I used to be a line cook so I learned to make a lot of things. Japanese, German and Southern foods are my favs though."
4040,I wish I was a good cook. I live by the coast in FL and eat a lot of seafood.
4040,I live by the coast in Virginia. About 20 minutes from the beach. I don't get to eat seafood often though.
4040,Now that the weather is cooling down we will be BBQing much more often then when it is hot and humid.
4040,That sounds fun. I was supposed to go camping this weekend but couldn't afford to. I'm not good at BBQing but cooking on a campfire works better for me.
4040,have a nice weekend
4040,You too!
4041,I would like to adopt a goldendoodle. They are so cute
4041,You totally should! I volunteer at a shelter and there some there that need homes!
4041,I should go check out my local shelter! I plan to retire in 6 months so I want a new friend and I'd love to train a puppy
4041,Congrats on retirement! What did you do for work?
4041,THank you! I worked in construction for 30 years. What do you do?
4041,That's hard work! You must be talented. I am hair stylist. I work so much I don't have time to cut my own hair to my knees.
4041,"Wow, that sounds like an interesting job. Do you meet lots of new people through it?"
4041,I do! They always have really interesting and wild stories about their lives.
4041,That sounds like fun. I love meeting new people
4041,"It can be exhausting talking to people all day, but overall it is fun. What will you do once your retired?"
4041,That's good. I don't know yet. Maybe do some traveling
4041,I can't wait to have the time and money to travel. You should hit Europe!
4042,not really but they stick out to me. They're kinda cool
4042,"That's fair, I'm not too into it myself. What do you listen to nowadays, or do you even like music nowadays?"
4042,I've been listening to a lot of metal. Stuff like lamb of god an Vldjarta. 
4042,"Ahh I'm starting to get into them, not too familiar though. Who are they similar to?"
4042,which band?
4042,"Lamb of God, sorry I may have misunderstood haha. Are they a band?"
4042,yeah they are
4042,"Ah right, what style of metal do they play? Noise rock, death metal, gothic, etc."
4043,"Ah I see, I wish I had more time to work on my own outdoor garden but training takes up a lot of my time. You sound extremely knowledged"
4043,"It's a passion of mine. Ragini, my lizard, appreciates it too. How is training?"
4043,"Training is hard, however this past week I have been suffering with a cold so I haven't been able to train... Monday will hurt a lot!"
4043,Don't work yourself too hard! It's important to rest when you're sick.
4043,Thank you! however my body is going to get it this coming week. Do you like to exercise?
4043,Only if I'm with someone. I'm the kind of person who needs a workout buddy.
4043,"I know what you mean, you are in the right mindset as I have a workout buddy who I have been with for 2 years now. really helps put limits"
4043,"What kind of workouts do you like? I tend to lean towards cardio, abs, and swimming."
4043,I do like to do weight training. I am also trying to learn how to do a handstand (gymnastics one). Do you like to swim outside?
4043,"Sometimes, but I generally prefer indoor pools. My local one is very nice."
4043,I also prefer indoors as the sea is way to cold for me. Are you a strong swimmer?
4043,I'm improving! Doing laps is making me faster and more efficient.
4044,Lack of rest for certain as well as little enjoyment doing things I love. Like Painting.
4044,I hear that.  You should always make time for what you love.  For me it's talking!
4044,Ha! I too can be a chatty person! I love getting to know new people.
4044,Indeed.  I love meeting new people.  Especiall online because there are no preconcieved notions about one another.
4044,I agree totally. And people often take time to ask questions and understand others whereas that's unlikely in person.
4044,Exactly.  Before you know it you feel like you've known the person forever.  I've met a few people like.
4044,I've made a few friends the same way. One of which has now been my friend for going on 6 years!
4044,Me too!  I met a few people playing online games and still have relationships with them to this day.
4044,That's amazing! Which games that are popular right now are you into playing
4044,Currently I love to play Clash of Clans but years ago when I met people it was through Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2.  Which games are you favorites?
4044,Like we talked about earlier I haven't had much time for games lately. It's been a long time since I've been able to play.
4044,I hear that.  A break every now and then is really important.
4045,"I haven't seen my family in a bit, I don't like all the gatherings."
4045,you mean for the holidays?
4045,Yes. The whole having to buy gifts and sitting around and being expected to do things.
4045,you can always make your own traditions.
4045,"I do want to see my family again, maybe I can bring up new ideas to them."
4045,"yeah, just keep it simple and do different things each year.  "
4045,"I would love that! I don't want to worry about gifts, just sitting around and talking with them is all I need to have a happy holiday."
4045,those are the best moments of the holidays.
4045,"exactly, I am going try to get in contact with them about spending the holiday's with them again."
4045,i think they would really like that.
4045,I hope they will. I do miss them. I hope they will listen to me when I say I just want things to be calm and informal
4045,that's the way to look at things!
4046,What's your favorite anime?
4046,I've watched some Attack on Titan and I think that series is really cool.
4046,I've heard that series is really good
4046,Yeah it's pretty good but I think I prefer American TV shows because reading subtitles gets annoying.
4046,"When I watch anime, I watch dubs so I don't have to watch subtitles "
4046,I like doing that too but it seems like the sound quality gets worse with dubs.
4046,I guess. I haven't noticed any difference in it .
4046,What's your favorite anime?
4046,That's a hard one. I'm not sure I could pick just one!
4046,What series first got you into anime?
4046,Pokemon lol
4046,I love Pokemon.
4047,"Wow, that's a long running show. What else do you like to watch on TV?"
4047,it is my favorite show . that and cooking shows
4047,I love cooking shows. Do you like to cook?
4047,yes i love to just cook all day ! ! !
4047,Me too! What is your favorite thing to cook?
4047,anything like any food really
4047,That's cool. My favorite is italian food
4047,Italian food is delicious.
4047,Agreed! I also love mac n cheese
4047,"Mmm, I love mac and cheese too. It's so good what else do you like"
4047,I like baking a lot. I like making cakes
4047,I like baking bread
4048,Very scary and really fast
4048,"Was it a wooden one? Those are the best! I used to live near a big amusment park in Sandusky, OH"
4048,No the new metal one actually it was the Goliath
4048,I try not to eat before I get on one so that I don't feel sick. Ever ridden a rollercoaster in the dark?
4048,Yes I have in Florida Space Mountain indoor roller coaster
4048,I liked the one they have a Kings Island in Cincinnati. It is a corkscrew rollercoaster. What kind things are you studying in school?
4048,I'm not in school graduated awhile ago.
4048,"I work in a real estate office, I get to see some great properties! What career do you have?"
4048,I have a mobile food vending business
4048,That sounds great and lucrative as well. What type of foods do you supply?
4048,Your basic hot dog and hamburger with chips and drinks
4048,Im sure you do a good business. Sounds like a fun venture and can envolve your family!
4049,"Definitely, or executed. Sounds extreme but wouldn't take to many to send the message"
4049,Divergent ways to laws about animal cruelty occur different everywhere. could you believe in some places they eat dogs?
4049,Makes me so mad. I have to go to yoga classes sometimes to calm down due to this 
4049,i love yogo! i like watching it because i'm to lazy to do it haha!
4049,lol i honestly need to do it for the exercise as well. i like italian food too much haha
4049,"well with yoga, which is a form of fitness,that comes with good diet, and ill tell you what yoga & Italian food is not a good mix haha"
4049,"i agree, unfortunately my will power is a skill not yet developed lol"
4049,So true. Maybe you could use an authentic cookbook and try to make some recipes at home ! Try The Silver Spoon for some Italian favorites.
4049,I'd like to write a book on how to eat all the italian you want without getting fat lol
4049,"Yeah, you'd get pretty fat like that. Although any Italian cuisine is good. I like all the food from Italy."
4049,"Indeed, but throw a lasagna in front of me and i'm completely useless for the rest of the day "
4049,lol . you'd be on a healthy dehydrated food diet .
4050,He had a gun on him. It was scary!
4050,Did you try to grab the gun?
4050,"No, I was afraid that he would actually use it."
4050,Do you know any martial arts?  Maybe you could have swept the leg.
4050,I took tae kwon do in elementary and high school but I stopped once I entered vet school. It's been years.
4050,"You probably still recall some technique though, no?"
4050,"Sure, but I'm out of practice. I didn't want to risk it. "
4050,So what happened with the attacker?  Did you get injured at all?
4050,"He didn't do anything more than throw threats around, but I was pretty shaken up. "
4050,Makes me wish I had to time to take self defense.  But iwth a 40 hour work week it's tough to find time.
4050,Totally understandable. The animal shelter keeps me so busy!
4050,I support my local shelter.  I think it's really important.  Glad to hear you're doing noble work!
4051,mashed potatoes and gravy. whats yours?
4051,Mashed potatoes and gravy is pretty great! I'd have to say my favorite is sushi. 
4051,I like sushi too! Have you ever had your favorite restaurant close?
4051,"I haven't had that happen, but have had to move to a new city before, hours away from my favorite restaurant. "
4051,How did that go? Do you do well with change?
4051,"Just like with anything, you get used to it. I've made new favorites. There's plenty of great restaurants where I am. "
4051,That's true. I have a really hard time with change. I'm recently single since my girlfriend broke up with me. Trying to find a new normal
4051,"I'm sorry to hear that. I think everyone has a hard time with change to a point, especially big life changes like that. "
4051,Definitely. Thanks for your sympathies. Have you seen anything good on TV lately?
4051,Of course! I like to watch good docuseries. There's one i've been into lately called Homicide Hunter. 
4051,That sounds intriguing! I will have to check that out.
4051,"Oh, it's really good. What kind of TV do you like to watch?"
4051,I really like Reality TV and true crime
4052,I will miss him a lot. Texas won't be the same without him!
4052,Moving away is hard. You guys must have been real close.
4052,"We were! We both born the same day and were very premature, so it really bonded us."
4052,Wow that is close. How far away is your cousin now?
4052,About 200 miles. I am planning to visit over the holidays. Do you have holiday plans?
4052,Not really as my family is about 3000 miles from me and I don't like flying and the drive is about 3 days or so.
4052,I hate flying too!
4052,I have a big fear of heights so I have to drive if I go places.
4052,I am scared of heights too! I wonder where that phobia comes from.
4052,My brother says it's a control issue lol He gets mad that I won't fly out to see him.
4052,He should be more understanding of your fears.
4052,I agree but I like to drive anyway but not that far.
4053,"Oh wow that's very peculiar, how is that day-to-day? Easy to handle?"
4053,Not too bad. I guess I don't really know what its like to not have it... so it is normal for me. What fascinates you about it?
4053,"I just think it's interesting to have what sounds like such a different perspective, especially as an interior designer. You could see something great I'd miss, for instance."
4053,i never thought about it like that . i love your perspective! So are you creative?
4053,"I wish! It's run in the family so I can't ever be too sure, my mum was one. What about you, how's your work life?"
4053,"well work is good thank you, I am currently throwing myself in to my work as my parents are finally getting a divorce! long needed to be honest"
4053,"Oh wow, I'd give my sympathy and still hope you're okay, but it sounds like you're happier than not haha. Was it that bad?"
4053,"its fine, they aren't ever been close and they have both been talking about it for years... just too lazy to actually do it haha. Are your parents together "
4053,"Yeah though I don't think it was their choice. For context, they met each other 21 years ago, I'm 20 haha"
4053,"Ah I see, well I am divorced myself now however they have done really well for 20 years! you must have kept them together :)"
4053,"I think it's the opposite lol they may only be together because I was born, but hey, it is what it is. How was your divorce, okay?"
4053,"Yeah it was the BEST thing to ever happen to me, my ex wife was extremely violent and manipulative (only realised when I left) "
4054,"no, i went to see my therapist about it because i'm so worried about my job"
4054,I can see the why you would feel that way. I would be worried too.
4054,i don't have a family other than my older brother
4054,Do you think that's part of why you are having difficulty at your job currently?
4054,"yes, my older brother is in jail"
4054,Why is he in jail?
4054,he stole some things from his neighbor's garage
4054,"How does his decision with regards to that, and his time in jail, affect you?"
4054,i'm just always worrying about everything all the time
4054,What precisely are you spending your time worrying about?
4054,losing my job and losing my brother
4054,I'm sorry to hear that.  Do you think either of those things are really likely at this point?
4055,Jerry
4055,That's a great name. I have a son named Ethan
4055,that's awesome! I have a son also. His name is Roger hahaha
4055,Roger is a good strong name! Does he also have reddish brown hair? 
4055,sorta. more Brown than red.  The Wife has brown hair
4055,Oh so he must have gotten his hair color from her. 
4055,yup. 
4055,So what do you like to do for fun?
4055,i actually ski race
4055,That sounds like a good way to have fun and get some exercise! Where do you practice?
4055,there's a lot of trails in Colorado so I just practice there. it's interesting
4055,Is that something you do year-round? 
4056,"Kinda. More miserable than anything, in a lot of pain and can't eat, so he's bummed about that most"
4056,I'm sure. I hope he feels better soon!
4056,"Thanks, me too. I made some pasta for dinner, we both love it, and he looked so sad. Felt like the worst dad"
4056,i made homemade pasta and finished the meal with ice cream .
4056,Yum. I followed mine up with cookies. Can't get enough of those things lol
4056,"True, I like chocolate chip cookies. But Fortune cookies are interesting. They sometimes have sesame seed oil"
4056,"That is interesting. Also interesting that they aren't even from China, yet only seem offered in Chinese restuarants"
4056,that's true . have you just been to china ?
4056,"never been, maybe one day though. you?"
4056,"I have not, but I hope so soon"
4056,"It seems like an awesome place, except their government freaks me out a bit"
4056,I agree. Their government is scary
4057,She lives in queens.  Her and I love to play soccer in the park to get fresh air.
4057,That is nice. I have been living in new your for decades now. This is defiantly the place of fast life.
4057,Fast indeed.  So fast that I've been unable to avoid to accidents in the city!  Cars drive crazy here.
4058,I had a really good time and got to work on my guitar playing skills
4058,How exciting! Do you staff at camps often?
4058,This was the first time for me. I had to wear khakis the entire time though which was a drag. 
4058,Oh wow! Uniforms. How long have you been playing the guitar?
4058,"I started around a dozen years ago, everyone says I'm a natural talent. Do you play any instruments? "
4058,"No, I wish I did. I've never tried any instrument. I would like to learn to play the piano in my free time. It fascinates me."
4058,Its never to late to learn a new skill; you may turn out to be the next Mozart! 
4058,"Thank you, I have to make time for it! What do you like to do for fun?"
4058,Well a perfect day for me would likely be me just jamming away on the guitar without wearing any pants at home. Total Comfort. 
4058,That's awesome! Total comfort and peace of mind. It's great to have a hobby that you enjoy.
4058,What about you? Any favorite Hobbies?
4058,I love to cook! I watch cooking shows and try to mimic all of the fancy dishes that the chefs prepare.
4058,its always a challenge for me to make the same meal twice the same way. I like to experiment.
4058,I feel the same way. There are so many wonderful spices and herbs to try!
4059,"Oh wow, you sure know your dance knowledge, don't you? Do you participate in it?"
4059,"no, i just find it entertaining to watch"
4059,"Ahh I see, well what do you enjoy?"
4059,i love cooking!
4059,"Ah awesome! What do you cook, anything in particlular?"
4059,i love to make pepperoni and artichoke pizza.  what about you?  what do you like to do?
4059,"Ooo interesting, I'll give it a try! I'm a big fan of pumpkin, love eating them! Very lucky it's October haha"
4059,what sort of pumpkin dishes do you make?
4059,"I try to use everything I can in some way. Pumpkin seeds go with brie, the fillings go with pie, excess goes in drinks, etc. It's very versatile."
4059,wow!  i've never heard of a pumpkin drink before.
4059,"Wow I'm surprised! Pumpkin spiced latte is a popular drink this fall, I highly recommend it if you're interested in it"
4059,i will definitely give it a try
4060,It is okay. My kid was distracting me and I over fed it
4060,That's sweet that you have a family. I don't have parents because I was adopted.
4060,Aren't your adopted parents your family?
4060,"They are, but it would have been nice to know my biological family."
4060,I wonder if you can do some research to find them?
4060,I have tried to no avail. My adopted parents were pretty great though. They didn't make me to go school.
4060,You never went to school??
4060,Nope! It was a fun childhood of travel and play time.
4060,Wow! Lucky you
4060,Did you like school? How far did you go with your education?
4060,I did like school. I went all the way through college and just graduated
4060,Congrats! What was your major?
4061,"you know money is always a problem isn't it, I find it hard to save when good food these days is so expensive"
4061,"i'd imagine , i owe out so much i am lucky i can afford anything to eat"
4061,so do you like school? I love alternative kinds of food like chickpeas
4061,"I go to school right now.  I like some alternative foods, but chickpeas are not one of my favorites. In fact, I hate them. "
4061,what kind of food do you like? what's the best thing about school for you?
4061,"I like most foods-fruits and vegetables.  School is fun, but I'm really more about football.  I want to play professionally. "
4061,"that is a great goal to have, what is your dream team to play for?"
4061,"I think my goal is just to play for a winning team-I can play for any city, but I hate to lose. "
4061,that's a good driver to win! do you have any idols you like to watch?
4061,"I like to watch some football players- I suppose my favorite now is Brady, but I used to prefer watching Manning before he retired."
4061,Do you think they played at elementary school too?
4061,"I think they probably played football in elementary school too, but to be honest, I never really thought about it until right now."
4062,Baby anything are cute! Took my easel out there to paint the little fuzzballs.
4062,I love ducklings too.
4062,What have you been up to on this Saturday? I just saw Joker.
4062,Do you like it?
4062,"I did. Very dark, but so well done."
4062,Do you have a dog?
4062,Yes. I have a pitbull mix named Henry. Do you have a dog?
4062,"Yes, I do have a pup."
4062,What is his or her name? What kind of dog?
4062,He is a Pomeranian.
4062,They are so cute! Do you have to take him to the groomer often?
4062,"No, I do it myself."
4063,I know. I have tried to help them but they don't want to listen to me
4063,If their hoarding has become a true problem it may be time to sit down and talk to one or both of them about it. 
4063,I think it is probably time. I don't want to get into a fight but they need to stop
4063,My Mother is a bit of a hoarder herself. Mainly Fashion and items of that nature. She literally has 500 pairs of shoes!
4063,Wow! I wouldn't even know what to do with 100 pairs of shoes
4063, I told her that it was insane and I couldn't even regularly wear my 8 pair. So I know she hasn't set eyes on some in years!
4063,Wow! Maybe you could convince her to get rid of some of them
4063,I have brought it up a few times but never in a serious manner. I think it is time to do so. Want to make a deal?
4063,"Sure, what do you have in mind"
4063, I will address my mother's shoe hoarding issue with her and you will talk with your Sister about the hoarding tendencies they have and we can report back later.
4063,Sounds like a plan to me!
4063,Ok great! I think if we approach them with empathy and love the convos will go well.
4064,"I really liked the young librarian, I forgot his name, you?"
4064,"is it weird that i don't have a favorite character , i try not get attached. Too. Many. Deaths..."
4064,"no kidding, it's like survivor this season, the guy i liked is gone. do you have a favorite current show?"
4064,I enjoy Project Runway! I have started sewing my own clothes because of how all the amazing outfits!
4064,"I admire that, best I can sew is a pillow cover! What other hobbies do you have?"
4064,Thanks for asking! I really enjoy playing the piano. It has such a beautiful sound. How about you?
4064,I like gardening and listening to music. Do play classical piano? I love Chopin
4064,I wish I could of met Chopin. He seems like someone I would have loves to have a conversation with.
4064,"for sure, an exceptional composer. "
4064,Man it's so much fun to just have a good conversation with people.
4064,"We need more of that, tired of the social media fakeness"
4064,I agree. it feels good to show genuine interest without having to worry about reputation online.
4065,I had a bit too much to drink and revealed something that I shouldn't have said.
4065,"whoaa! i can relate! i have a problem myself, can you share what happen?"
4065,"Well, I had a crush on the driver. He was the designated driver. When he dropped me off I blurted my feelings and gave him a peck on the cheek."
4065,How would you describe how you did it? Many different cultures have different definition of kisses! was it in a flirty way? 
4065,Yes it was. Now I'm afraid that I've blown my chances with him. It wasn't very sophisticated of me!
4065,"ahhhh do not feel guilty . we all do what we can , right ?"
4065,"Yes we all do what we can, but since this was in front of my friends they will tease me without end."
4065,"well , you need to find something to tease them about . i drink heavily myself and i blame myself for all my problems."
4065,Alcohol is my drug of choice:) But it gets me in trouble too sometimes. I just blabber away...
4065,Have you considered talking to someone to help your addiction to alcohol?
4065,"No,not really..How about yourself? We both need to be kinder to ourselves I think."
4065,Yes. We can try to improve our mental health for ourselves and those around us.
4066,NO not yet but there are cameras where my car was so I'm gonna get the footage pulled monday
4066,That's a great idea! I hope you find them soon!
4066,thank you man! What do you do for a living?
4066,I work in higher education. What about you?
4066,I work as a game warden
4066,oh wow ! that must be an interesting job !
4066,yeah it's pretty fun! i love the outdoors
4066,What's your favorite part about the job?
4066,honestly just being outdoors. being able to make sure people follow the law while doing it is a pluss. 
4066,It sounds like a really rewarding job
4066,it is.  I fish/hunt on my off time too so it's like i'm not even going to work
4066,Wow! Have you always fished as a hobby? I've never been.
4066,yup it's really rewarding to get a big catch
4067,I must be an earthling because I've never heard of it. Where is the Nebastrium solar system?
4067,It's about 30 light years away from Earth.
4067,That's really hard to fathom... I wonder what the equivalent of one light year away from earth would be.
4067,I'm sure a quick google search could enlighten us.  I'd like to know that myself.
4067,"I was curious enough to do that, apparently one light year is about 6 trillion miles."
4067,"Wow, that is way more than I thought!"
4067,"It travels 36,373 mph, and would take 18449 years to travel one light year... I think it's safe to say we will never know how that feels"
4067,That's true.  But only if we use traditional ways of travel.  Perhaps we will discover teleportation.
4067,You have a valid point. I'd be excited if that were to happen in our lifetime!
4067,Me too!  I've always wondered about teleportation.  I believe if we can conceieve it we can achieve it!
4067,"Teleportation would make life so much easier, and probably a lot safer."
4067,Imagine being able to be in the grocery store in seconds and then back home after you get your food in seconds!  I wonder about the food though...
4068,Interesting - I wish it would become bigger and better here.
4068,"I wish it were, same with soccer. Soccer doesn't seem to resonate here as much"
4068,"Yeah, my local MLS team has been pretty terrible. Plus the US men's team is terrible lately."
4068,"Sorry to hear that, not surprised about the US team lol"
4068,They lost to Canada last week for the first time in 30 years.
4068,The streak had to end sometime I suppose. What do you do for a living?
4068,I work in radiology. What about you?
4068,"I'm a writer. I wanted to be a vet when I was younger though, not sure how I ended up here lol"
4068,Do you write fiction or nonfiction?
4068,fiction mainly
4068,Very cool! I have become a fan of audiobooks recently.
4068,"I love audiobooks, almost as much as actual books.got a favorite?"
4069,He is good. My wife wanted him to stay. We just got married like a year ago. So I do not want to go against my wife. 
4069,I can understand! What kind of cat is it do you know? 
4069,To be honest no. But thank you maybe my wife knows. I will ask.
4069,Where did you find the cat? 
4069,I found it next to my salon. I am the owner of it so when I was closing down I saw it next to the garbage pale. 
4069,Aw how sweet! Owner of a salon that is cool. Is it a hair salon or a nail salon? Or do you do both?
4069,I do both and my wife helps me. She is into beaty.
4069,How cool! Do you guys play Jason Mraz in your salon? I am a huge fan of his music. 
4069,No. Who is he? Can you tell me more about him. 
4069,"Jason Mraz is a singer and songwriter and plays indie folk music. He sings one of my favorite songs ""I'm Yours"""
4069,Alright. I will definitely look into him and find out more. Maybe one day you will visit my salon. 
4069,I will probably visit your salon! I need my nails done. Do you do manicures and pedicures?
4069,Yes. Would love to see you there. Bye bye...
4070,I hope. I need to find somewhere warmer to live
4070,that's cool . maybe you do belong somewhere a little warmer .
4070,Do you like the cold?
4070,I love the cold. it keeps me cool when i sleep.
4070,I love the warmer weather because I can go swimming
4071,I remember reading it in my police report when I got a public intoxication LOL
4071,"Oh no! You should never lash out on people while drunk, the worst of things can happen under the influence."
4071,I know. I was definitely just a dumb college kid.
4071,"Ah, I've made plenty of dumb choices in my life too. Honestly, I think it's part of being young"
4071,I agree. It's part of growing up. I'm trying to mature. I have been single for several years and would really like to find someone special to settle down with.
4071,I wish you luck.  You have to meet the right one some day!
4071,Lets hope! Have you?
4071,"not yet , but someday i will be . just have to find the right person first"
4071,For sure. What do you do for fun? I am an avid fisherman
4071,I do all kinds of fishing. I have never done the sea fishing though.
4071,deep sea fishing is a dream of mine
4071,I would be scared of the big waves after watching all those discovery channel shows.
4072,I need your advice
4072,Sure how can I help? not sure I am the best person to give advice however
4072,"I loaned my car to a friend, thinking he'd take good care of it,but I was wrong."
4072,What did he do with it?
4072,"Left it dirty, and smelly.  I couldn't believe it!"
4072,"At least he didn't wreck it, ask him to get it cleaned"
4072,"I feel like I did him a favor, and he didn't appreciate it.  It's not the value of the issue"
4072,"yeah not cool on his part. Lesson learned next time he needs it, explain why you say no"
4072,"For sure! I love the smell of leather, and now it smells like food and ash!"
4072,I hate that smell
4072,Riht?
4072,"I would never let anyone use my car even my family, it is my baby"
4073,nylon? wow that must mean they are delicate?
4073,"Kind of, so I prefer to the metal ones."
4073,how comes? what do you prefer about them?
4073,"I just think they were made better back in the day, but now it is a different story."
4073,what's different about them now? I wish I could play
4073,Personally I think there is not much difference. Yeah you can play.
4073,I wouldn't know where to start! how did you start
4073,I started when I was young. You can watch the YouTube teaching videos if you can't afford a tutor.
4073,"good point, I need to buy a guitar first!"
4073,"You can buy a used guitar in the beginning, and if you really enjoy playing it, get a new one then."
4073,I will I think! I love the piano myself
4073,Wow! I love the beautiful piano music. Maybe I could start taking some piano lessons and go to a recital of my own.
4074,"I'm going to head to Nashville TN, to visit the Grand Ole Opry!"
4074,I love it there its always a great time
4074,I like to get out and listen to new music but i really love Merle Haggard the most. Do you have a favorite type of music?
4074,I really like pop but I sometimes listen to hiphop and rock
4074,Good music for me Has got to have soul to it. Across all genres of music you get some songs that do and others that don't. 
4074,"I feel what you mean, when I'm looking for soulful music I like to listen to Queen"
4074,"Freddie Mercury really knew how to use his voice to maximum effect, and was a good lyricist to boot. One of my faves"
4074,"Me too, he really knows how to hit all of the notes in a song"
4074,I wish i could have caught him in concert. It seems like my favorite artists are all already gone.
4074,Yeah I wish he was still around but unfortunately Freddie is long gone
4074,Well I guess we can always look forward to the next legend to be born.
4074,Yeah but with the current state of music I feel like that may take awhile
4075,What do you do?
4075,"i play for the baltimore orioles, how about you"
4075,I want to be a football player
4075,Did you play college football? I hear its one step from professional
4075,uh. no I'm still in highschool
4075,"i see, why dont you game now then ? dont you have any time for it ?"
4075,my grades arent the best.
4075,That's ok.  Employers don't look at your grades I don't think.
4075,i hope not but i still have to get good enough grades to get into college
4075,"Yes, you do. You can do it!"
4075,I think im gonna get a tutor
4075,"Oh wow, that will help you out immensely."
4076,I play mostly for the exercise but I really enjoy it.  Do you play?
4076,Yes I used to play soccer.
4076,It's great exercise and fun to play. I don't really like watching it though. 
4076,"Yeah it can be a little boring to watch.  I haven't played in years, would love to get back into it."
4076,We play twice a week. You would be welcome if you want to join.. 
4076,I would love to play soccer with you.
4076,You could come today if you like.
4076,"Can't make it today, maybe another day."
4076,No problem.  I will let you know our schedule. 
4076,"Sounds good, would love to play with you guys."
4076,We aren't super competitive but we have a lot of fun and get a lot of exercise. 
4076,Yes sports can be a great way to socialize and also stay in good shape.
4077,"Its an event at Universal, just a bunch of scary halloween stuff. it's awesome"
4077,That sounds awesome!  I went to Disney recently and went on the Tower of Terror.
4077,"I love that ride. I love disney in general, except food prices."
4077,I know that's right.  They are so expensive.  Since I'm single it doesn't cost me much though.  Plus I get to hit the quick lines!
4077,"Nice lol. I'm a pasta freak so everywhere I go I have to get some, Disney is no exception. Takes most of my money lol"
4077,Now you're making me hungry!  I'm gonna hop in the bmw and hit Olive Garden!
4077,Good idea lol. I might do the same
4077,You have  bmw as well?  I just actually got it.  I've been dreaming about owning one for years.
4077,"Pfff no I could never afford one. I work as a swimming instructor, love swimming, but no big bucks to be made"
4077,Well being single has allowed me to buy things here and there that I wouldn't be able to otherwise.  But I know what you mean.
4077,"You're a smart one, dude."
4077,"You are as well, thank you!"
4078,Do you think they have changed much since then?
4078,I am not sure but the company was founded in 1894 so it for sure has come a long long ways since then!
4078,"My son loves them, in fact, he's been joking about having them at his wedding reception next month!"
4078,that is so nice of him ! my husband won't go .
4078,"Oh that's too bad, we were looking forward to catching up with the two of you. "
4078,Right? He's just not a fan of big crowds
4078,I totally understand.  They did choose a large venue.  Corn dogs would be cheaper than a caterer!
4078,"lol, right!"
4078,Are you sure he won't come?  Mike thinks of him like a second father.
4078,I wish he would. I will try to convince him to come
4078,"That would be amazing! The older we get, the harder it is to get together with old friends."
4078,I agree. It's been so long since we've seen you
4079,really? what sports do you play?
4079,I play hockey. I am a center
4079,nice! I use to play rugby 
4079,Nice! That's a really rough sport. Have you ever been injured from it?
4079,yeah I cracked my ribs a lot. dislocated my shoulder. ya know the fun stuff
4079,"Oh gosh thats not good. I've never broken a bone, but I injured my back and need to go to a doctor"
4079,yikes. what happened
4079,Slipped and fell on my back on the ice
4080,"Not sure about the mountain names, I was there taking care of my mother and father. They are dead now."
4080,Sorry to hear that. Did you experience anything interesting there?
4080,"Yes, alot of beautiful scenery and land. People are friendly as well. I just got to Dublin, Ireland afew weeks ago."
4080,Oh ok great. How's the weather there?
4080,"Dreary most days since I have been here. Today is nice. The funeral was yesterday. I am sad, but they were very old. I am 49."
4080,Oh ok. Hopefully the weather can cheer you up some. How's the food there?
4080,"My folks were killed in a boating accident. They had me when in late 30's. I am the only son, and only child. Food not so good."
4080,Oh wow. Is it cold often?
4080,I am ready for some good ole' American food. My folks raised in Oklahoma and came back to Ireland where they were born. It is too cold for me.
4080,"Yea I'm a warm person myself, not too fond of cold weather. A burger sounds good."
4080,You live in Dublin long? Have you had an American made Whopper from Burger King?
4080,No. Yes the food there is great.
4081,"I have, and felt bad after too. What happened?"
4081,I had a girlfriend but realized we just weren't compatible. She smoked and I couldn't stand it.
4081,That's a shame. Do you regret it?
4081,I did for awhile but I got over it pretty quickly. 
4081,Are you still friends now or have you moved on?
4081,We are friends now. I hope we stay friends.
4081,"Fingers crossed, so what are your hobbies?"
4081,"I like hiking in the woods. I also like to read,"
4081,"Nice, I like the outdoors too. But I'm more into fashion."
4081,What kind of fashion do you like?

4091,Do that make you feel better or miss them more?
4091,It depends. But most of the time it makes me feel better.
4091,That's good. It's hard to miss family and not be able to see them. Are you saving to go?
4091,Yeah.
4091,Well I'm sure they'll like that and I bet they're gonna miss you too.
4092,I love being outdoors but these days in my free time I spend far too much time on video games. It's my guilty pleasure.
4092,"I love video games, or I used to. I dunno how they are anymore. I'm in the boonies so my technology is about 10 years behind"
4092,Is there poor wifi where you live in the boonies? I'm in the boonies myself but was able to get a verizon wireless card that gives me decent internet.
4092,Yeah it definitely could be better. Wish I had verizon now after hearing that
4092,"Living in the middle of nowhere, it's the only wireless provider that I've had a good experience with. I always have signal. I'm a customer for life! lol"
4092,Might need to look into making the switch!
4092,never hurts to check something new out at least right! Good luck. I couldnt live without decent internet.
4092,I couldn't agree more
4092,What kind of stuff do you like to do out in the boonies where you are?
4092,go fishing and hunting usually
4092,I fish and I love it. I like to target practice but I'm not much of a hunter. I've only been out to the woods once to hunt for deer.
4092,"It takes practice for sure, but the experience of just being out there is the best part for me"
4093,She is the only person in this world that I can trust with that much money.
4093,Oh wow I can understand your strong feelings
4093,Yeah she's like a sister to me. 
4093,"Yea thats so nice,I have no friends, just my cat Leela"
4093,"Aw I love cats so much.  I have a cat too.  Although I will say, cats can be real jerks sometimes."
4093,"she can be annoying , especially when i m cooking  lol"
4093,Yeah my cat is always wanting to knock things off the desk or table.  It's like natural instinct to him.
4093,"Haha yea, I actually have a youtube and film her doing stuff like that all the time haha"
4093,What kinds of things do you film her doing?
4093,Sometimes I play pranks on her and scare her lol thats people favorite

4094,i love ravioli! They are a type of dumpling
4094,"Ah, the best one in my opinion"
4095,Apples are actually my favorite fruit.
4095,Do you mean to say that apples are good and can be considered the opposite of evil?
4095,For sure! Was it even an apple with Eve? I think it was some other kind of fruit.
4095,"I've heard that, but apple is more recognizable I suppose"
4095,So you said you lived in a mansion? Or did your mom just work there?
4095,It was more shared with the whole family. But later my dad hired a maid.
4095,Wow. How many people lived there?
4095,it was packed with a lot of people !  
4095,I grew up in a crowded house too but it was really small.
4095,"Did you have a restaurant, hotel, retail shopping or any of those things attached to yours?"
4095,Of course not! Wow. You must be pretty rich.
4095,"More money,more problems"

4096,I like to cook but mostly baking. What is your favorite dish to make?
4096,I love making sweet potato casserole! what do you like to bake
4096,"Love sweet potatoes, I bake my own bread, it is very rewarding and easy"
4096,Would you ever work in a bakery? thats my dream for retirement!
4096,"I doubt it, it is hard work and you have to get up early! I prefer to bake for fun for my family and friends"
4096,Thats great! i bet they appreciate that
4096,"The bread is a great thing to share, everyone likes bread. Don't tellme you are gluten intolerant LOL"
4096,NO i would literally die if i couldnt eat bread
4096,You and me both! Nothing wrong with making some more bread!
4096,"Ill have to get a recipe from you, i only know how to make banana bread"

4098,My job is just the same old thing every single day.
4098,Do you ever watch racing on the tv?
4098,"Yes! I love it. My tradition every night after work is to watch racing and eat mac and cheese actually, lol"
4098,HAHA!  That is the best tradition I've ever heard of!
4098,Thanks lol. Do you watch racing?
4098,On weekends.  Darrell Waltrip is my favorite driver
4098,Mine is Danica Patrick.
4098,Very nice role-model as well!
4099,"Yum. I've been looking into new business ideas, tacos might be the way to go after this convo haha"
4099,"Oh I would definitely come to your taco stand.  Tacos in the summer, heaven!"
4099,Word up lol. A food truck would be awesome to run. I have a new chevy truck I could maybe convert
4099,"YES!  Although it might get hot in the summer, but spring and fall would work out great!"
4099,Yeah I'd definitely have to invest in some decent AC for summertime
4099,What kind of tacos are you thinking about serving?  You could probably have a bunch of little meat stations set up.
4099,Whatever the customers would want. I'd love to be the go-to taco stand in town
4099,I think the key is the toppings.... have a great salsa and a great sauce and WORD WILL SPREAD

4100,Yes but i am nervous they will know it is me that called
4100,How many other neighbors do you have? Would it be super easy for them to know it was you? 
4100,There are 6 of us in the apartment complex. I need to move. I am only a church pantry worker though
4100,Maybe some of the other church members will help you out in some fashion. I've read there are some kind hearted people ni the churc
4100,Yes there are
4100,That's good. Hopefully they are generous. Your kids need a better environment
4100,totally agree thank you. do you have kids
4100,"No, my wife and I don't have kids. I've been in a wheelchair since before I met her and it would have been hard on us"
4100,Im so sorry to hear that. I hope you are ok
4100,Thank you. It was hard at first but I have gotten used to it and am able to deal with it
4101,nice! i USE TO play tenor drums in marching band when I was in HS and Did Drum Corps
4101,Thats cool I was in band for a little while in school but then I eventually transfered to another subject
4101,nice! I just liked performing in front of a ton of people. It was a rush
4101,"Thats cool that you have that type of talent, I for one don't have the strength to get up in front of that many people"
4101,how do you handle performing in front of a local crowd? does it make you nervous
4101,"Well it makes me pretty nervous I just have to do alot to calm my nerves, but other than the anxiety the being in a band was pretty cool"
4101,yeah I bet it is. I need to learn  how to play kit 
4101,"If you could play, what would you do?"
4101,like what kind of music?
4101,"Yeah, rock, the blues, jazz; what type of music do you like?"
4101, So I have a tenor practie pad and usually I justcover hip hop and metal songs so with a kit I would play metal and cover hip hop tracks
4101,"Thats pretty cool man, what type of metal songs do you like?"
4102,Yea it's a pretty big deal to my family also. 
4102,What is your career?
4102,Supervisor at a manufacturing company. How about you?
4102,Freelancer
4102,Ok. I do some freelancing on the side my self while I'm drinking tea.
4102,"Nice.  I dont drink tea, only coffee. Do you like coffee?"
4102,Yes I do But  prefer a nice iced tea. Do you have any siblings?
4102,One brother. You?
4102,Four sisters. I'm the only boy
4102,Poor guy!!
4102,lol. Lucky you.
4102,:)))
4103,"Yes, it was just me growing up.  But, I had a lot of cousins, nearby."
4103,I have a lot of cousins too
4103,"Sometimes, cousins can be closer than siblings.  I have one cousin who is one day older than me."
4103,Yeah I see what you mean.  I used to be very close to one of my cousins too.
4103,"But, I must admit, I was jealous of kids who had brothers and sisters.  That seemed more normal."
4103,It's not either normal or abnormal to have siblings.  What's more important is the close relationships you can have with people.
4103,"That is true.  If I have children, I want to have at least two.  That would be my preference."
4103,Yes this could be nice. It helps to develop a bond with the children.
4103,"I think it helps with any problems of feeling  alone.  I had that a little, growing up"
4103,Yeah that's a really good point.  Having the bond of a sibling can be extremely important.
4103,That helps a lot.  Especially if you grow up with busy parents who can't spend that much time with you
4103,that is true . what is your family life like ?
4103,I can just describe it as very quiet.  Nothing out of the ordinary.
4104,"Well thats true, I guess, though i guess that animals would have us beat to it then by that logic. "
4104,My mom was really interested in how animals communicate.  She used to teach me bird calls when we played yard ball.
4104,My mom works in Telecommunications actually for a large utility company.
4104,"Mine has had several jobs since she raised me by herself, we moved around a lot.  Now she owns a pet store."
4104,Well hopefully she gets to enjoy her passion for animals. I guess i took after my dad who works in the automotive industry. We tend to work on cars.
4104,She really does enjoy.  I enjoy helping her out.  I even started a Salt water aquarium blog to promote the store.
4104,I once had a Caecilian worm. It disappeared from the tank only to be found in an Ac vent 2 weeks later... alive.
4104,Wow!  I bet you were happy to find him alive.  They are fascinating creatures.
4104,yes. I think I was a bit afraid of it at the time but in retrospect I really enjoyed it as well. 
4104,"It's neat how the more we learn about things, the more comfortable we become with them.  "
4104,"I once decided to carry a snake around with me through school. it was like having a pass to do whatever I wanted, none would stand in my way!"
4104,"I have two pet snakes, Boots and Stein!  I love them, but most people are terrified of them."
4105,How old is Bernie now?
4105,He 10 or so
4106,That is amazing! I also want to pursue this career
4106,"I think it's definitely a calling for really compassionate people. I'm not sure if I could do it, haha!"
4106,"Yes, it is very demanding but also rewarding! What is your job at the moment?"
4106,"I'm still a stay-at-home mom. To be honest, I have no idea what to do next."
4106,There are a lot of jobs right now online! You can start your blogging channel and get money and enjoyment from that
4106,I'm not sure I'm interesting enough to be an online personality.
4106,"If that does not interest you, you can maybe sell DIY products?"
4106,"I'm nowhere near creative enough! I might get my mother to teach me how to sew, though."
4106,"oh, I'd love to learn that as well. I really want to make a dress for myself"
4106,What kind of dress would you like to make?
4106,A dress that I would be able to wear to weddings or other occasions
4106,"Oh, I bet it would be beautiful!"
4107,i am a vegan
4107,What type of new foods have you discovered?
4107,tofu is really good with soup 
4107,"Have you tried any substitute proteins, I hear the impossible burger is a pretty good substitute"
4107,"no but i should try it, what foods do you like to eat ??"
4107,I eat Nigerian and American food
4107,haha so fast food??
4108,"Oh, it's interesting. Is it hard?"
4108,"Yeah it's pretty tough, but great for self defense."
4108,Is it only for young people?
4108,"nah you can get started at any age, but expect to be challenged!"
4108,I think I'm too old to do it.
4108,"Age is just a number, you can do anything you set your mind to!"
4108,I agree.
4108,I just want to be able to protect myself.  Getting mugged working the drive thru last month was terrifying!
4108,What happened?
4108,This dude just showed up with a knife wanting the money in the register.  If I was trained I could have fought him off!
4108,Were you injured? Did you call the police?
4108,"No, it just shook me up.  I realized if he'd wanted to hurt me I couldn't have stopped him.  Luckily he just wanted the cash"
4109,"Oh yeah, he's moving out of his apartment.  He's pretty rich so he has lots of knick knacks and things he has to move to his new place."
4109,That's cool. Is he a rapper by chance?
4109,"No, actually, he's a trucker."
4109,Oh ok. I assume he must have his own company.
4109,No he just works a ton.  
4109,Ok. Must be some crazy hours. What type of music do you like?
4109,"I've been really getting into indie music lately, what about you?"
4109,I like that too. I'm really into rap music.
4109,I like rap too.  Who are your favorite rappers?
4109,Drake And Migos. How about you?
4109,Nav has some pretty good songs.  
4109,Yea he's fire.
4110,"Not at the moment. I'm in the Navy, so it's a bit different than a civilian situation"
4110,"That's a shame, because I am trying to get a new job since losing mine as well. I do painting free-lance for now."
4110,"I wonder if I can do that. I've never lost a job before, let alone while being active military. "
4110,There is plenty of odd-end jobs that you could pick up and turn into a real profession if you put your mind to it!
4110,"I need to do something soon, gotta take care of my family. I'm an orphan, grew up foster, so my family is everything to me"
4110,"I feel you on that, I'm so sorry to hear about your situation. Try to do something in the meantime to take your mind off things for a bit."
4110,"I'm just trying to have fun with my wife and kids, praying for something to come through"
4110,"That's all you can do in the meantime, listen to some of your favorite tunes to help ease your mind for now. Do you like the Beastie Boys at all?"
4110,Love them. Licensed to Ill was my jam back in the day. and Paul's Boutique
4110,"Those are great groups too, give them a listen and maybe it'll help you through times like these."
4110,"Definitely. Thanks for listening to me, really means a lot"
4110,"You're welcome, I wish you the best going forward man!"
4111,What model of car do you have? And does it have any of those cool modern features?
4111,I actually have a Tesla! It drives itself. It's so cool!
4111,Really? Can you just chill in the backseat while it drives or do you have to play a role?
4111,Legally you have to be in the front seat I think lol. And I think I would want to be either way! Not sure I trust it completely.
4111,"Yeah, I had a feeling "
4111,What kind of car do you have?
4111,I drive an early 2000's toyota that I bought used
4111,That's cool! I have to go tend to my garden soon. Do you have a garden?
4111,I do but its currently buried in snow so its not like its much use
4111,Ah. That's one thing I love about living in Florida! I have my garden year round.
4111,What type of food do you grow in your garden? Cuz when I'm not eating the fruits of my labor I really enjoy fastfood
4111,I grow tomatoes and grapes and a lot of flowers. Have a couple of orange trees too. I love McDonald's!
4111,Do you eat alot because I certainly do!
4112,As do I! I made some good chicken fajitas and tacos. What do you like to cook?
4112,I love cooking. Thinking about becoming a chef. I love the way food brings people together. I make a mean mango salsa
4112,"Nice, that sounds delicious. i agree about food brining together, it is a great mediator. What kind of chef would you become?"
4112,I think i would me a mexican food chef. Maybe caribbean. I live on a private island
4112,I love Caribbean food. It has such great flavors and spices. I was just there earlier this year and can't wait to go back.
4112,It really does and it's all so fresh. Which place in the caribbean did you go to?
4112,We were in Jamaica for spring break. It was fun. Where is your island?
4112,it is about 30 nautical miles east of Aruba
4112,Aruba is a beautiful place. I can only image your island is just as great
4112,Thank you! You should come for a visit sometime. my family has a boat that we can charter for your family. What else do you do for fun?
4112,"That sounds like a lovely time, thank you generous offer! I love to fish, listen to music, and travel"
4112,Fishing is so fun! Whats the biggest fish you have caught
4112,We once caught a 150 pound tuna off the coast of Florida
4112,Wow!!!
4112,It was great. How about you? Do you fish often down there?
4113,No.  I am too lazy
4113,I'm lazy too!  Instead of working out I like to garden because I really like plants.
4113,"I like gardening too.  But, I like to grow vegetables.  I do that every summer"
4113,"Oh nice, yeah vegetable gardens are good to have. You can grow your own food and herbs!  "
4113,"I used to have a really big spot in a park, 20x40 feet.  I grew everything"
4113,"That's great! I wish more people would garden, so much healthier to grow your own food.  I just had a small vegetable garden this year."
4113,It would be a good thing if more people grew their own food.d  It would be healthier and cheaper
4113,"Yep, food is after all the source of our energy!"
4113,"Also, it is fun to grow things.  I love it when things start to sprout"
4113,Me too!  Watching things grow from sprouts to flower and vegetable bearing plants is really rewarding.
4113,"Yes.  I am always a little impatient, a little apprehensive, but I am usually rewarded with strong plants."
4113,Who needs the gym when we can grow healthy food lol
4113,That's true.  Real old school exercise.
4114,"We went to a private island home.  Of course, the kids weren't happy with it so I paid a babysitter to come with us so I could relax."
4114,"I see, that must have been fun. I always like being outdoors in seclusion. I enjoy camping in the National Forest."
4114,I bet the National Forest is nice.  Do you ever see bears?  I don't know if I could relax there.
4114,"I do see bears, and love it! They generally are skiddish and as long as you leave them alone, they are no harm."
4114,"Well that is good to hear!  I wouldn't mind seeing one, but maybe from the safety of my car."
4114,I often will take a hammock to my favorite place along the creek and take a nap in the summer. 
4114,That sounds amazing.  Lot's of mosquitoes down here if I tried to do that I would be eaten alive.
4114,"Well every part of the world has is challenges, but there is satisfaction to be had in conquering them! Carpe Diem!"
4114,"Yes, what a great way to look at life."
4114,"Thanks.  You must be busy being a parent , about how old are your kids?"
4114,"They are 7 and 10, a girl and a boy.  They can definitely be handfuls.  We stay busy."
4114,Well its good to make memories that they will be ableenjoy their live 
4115,Swimming can be very good for injury recovery cause of its low-impact nature
4115,exactly. I used it when I was rehabing an injury
4115,What injury did you have?
4115,i had a high ankle sprain
4115,"Oh wow, what caused it?"
4115,i was playing rugby. I went right and my ankle went left
4115,"Damn, how long were you out for?"
4115,about 2 weeks
4115,"Decent, that's really quick for that injury. You must have really looked after it during rehab"
4115,yeah I babied it. big time. I wanted to get back as fast as possible
4115,"I do blame you, I've had so many injuries over the years that swimming has come to my rescue more times than I can count"
4115,swimming is the GOAT 
4116,"YES! It hurt so bad, the pain just won't go away..any tips on how to heal it quicker?"
4116,ibuprofen and/or whiskey lol
4116,"Haha, yea that second option might be the way to go for me. What are you up to today?"
4116,Watch a little anime and maybe go buy some new MLP memorabilia. you?
4116,"That sounds interesting, definitely  would be out of the ordinary for me. I'm just watching random YouTube videos..somehow stumbled upon surgery videos ha."
4116,"I love surgery videos, not as much as My Little Pony, but close lol"
4116,"Yeah those are certainly on two very different spectrums, everyone has their own tastes and preferences though!"
4116,"Exactly. I know it's kinda weird, but we like what we like i suppose"
4116,"True that, no shame in whatever we like, we're all different people with differing interests at the end of the day."
4116,"Indeed. Plus I'm kinda hoping the memorabilia I buy now will be super valuable later on, make a sweet profit"
4116,"That's very true, I like special edged weapons that I collect, I too hope they are something that is sought after decades later."
4116,Now that would be another cool hobby to get into. Are those expensive?
4117,I can't afford it.
4117,"I hear you, its for sure expensive but i guess youd just have to determine if its worth it for you"
4117,I think so. I've been saving for it.
4117,"Well thats good, saving for school is important but saving in general is a good practice cause you dont know what could happen. "
4117,"Yeah, I agree. "
4117,what would you go to school for?
4117,Medicine. 
4117,"cool, what field in medicine?"
4117,Biomedical engineering.
4117,"That sounds pretty interesting, what school would you be going to?"
4117,Harvard Medical School.
4117,"Wow impressive you must be very smart, it does also sound quite expensive."
4118,"No kids right now, but I'm pretty happy at this point. You?"
4118,"Nope! Recently got a cat though, lol!"
4118,lol. Cats are cool. What kind of work did your dad do?
4118,He was a professional runner. I hate running! What about yours?
4118,Yea me too. He was a car salesman.
4118,I love walking though. What do you do for exercise?
4118,I do a lot of weight lifting. You lift any?
4118,Nah. I mostly just walk haha
4118,lol. That's perfectly fine. I should do more that myself.
4118,So what do you do for work?
4118,Music composer
4118,That's so cool!!
4119,I LOVE sushi.  It's so delicious.  Do you enjoy fishing?
4119,"no fishing for me but, pretty much my daily activities is cheerleading ."
4119,How do you like cheerleading?
4119,"I pretty much enjoy it for the most part, If i'm not doing that i'm working from home."
4119,What kind of work do you do from home?
4119,I have an online business. I sell medical equipment. 
4119,I've always wanted to work from home.  Do you enjoy owning your business?
4119,"yes, it doesn't feel like work! haha! what do you do for a living?"
4119,I fish for a living.
4119,"whoa sound alot better than what i do, haha!  you get to go travel alot huh?"
4119,We travel sometimes depending on the weather.  It's really nice being out in the sun all day.
4119,haha you get paid to get a sun tan? huh?
4120,I am doing great.  Listening to music
4120,what kind of music do you like?
4120,"Generally, I like rage metal music, but now I am listening to some old school Peter Frampton."
4120,"I like Peter Frampton, saw him when I lived in France in the 80's."
4120,He had one the great live albums of all time
4120,"Absolutely, Frampton Comes Alive is one of the best. Unfortunately I can only listen to it when my husband  and kids are not around."
4120,"What's the matter, they don't like real music? lol"
4120,"lol, right! We live in Canada and they only listen to French music.."
4120,I see.  Are they big Gordon Lightfoot fans?
4120,"Lol, absolutely! Not a day goes by that I don't Lightfoot playing in one of the twin's rooms."
4120,I still like Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  Classic.
4120,Yeah that is a classic for sure.
4120,Don't know many more Canadian artists except Celine Dionne and maybe Bachman Turner Overdrive
4121,Yes the storage had insurance
4121,Insurance is a way of protection from financial loss. It is there in case you have a wreck.
4121,I'm glad I signed up for storage insurance
4121,What all do you have stored so far?
4121,"Furniture, pictures, important documents, memorabilia and exercise equipment"
4121,that must be nice 
4121,"It's actually not that nice that some items are irreplacable and priceless, some of the stuff has personal value"
4121,You should think about that for all of your stuff got situations like this.
4121,The storage fire wasn't my fault so it's not my fault my stuff got damaged
4121,are you self employed ? what do you think the damages amount to ?
4121,"My employment shouldn't matter in this situation, the damages come out to $25,459"
4121,ouch ! i hope you get compensation for that .
4122,It's really hard to decide which beer to buy for our six year marriage anniversary party.
4122,"You should celebrate with a drink! I find it hilarious that nearly every civilization has independently discovered the processes of making beer, wine and spirits."
4122,"Right, and there are so many different kinds too.  I've personally tried 35 different types of beer in my lifetime. "
4122,Beer has been traced back almost 5000 years!
4122,That is a crazy fact too!  I guess because they really couldn't trust the water way back then.
4122,I believe so too.  There is even a Mesopotamian goddess of beer.
4122,I bet her temple of worship was a lot of fun.
4122,It sure was.
4122,"Do you enjoy a drink every now and then?  We do, especially during football and hockey season."
4122,I absolutely do! I have a bottle of beer that I'm drinking as we speak.like literally got a coors light on me now lol
4122,That's great.  I will have one when I watch the game later.
4123,My favorite hobbies are working in my garden and styling my long curly hair
4123,"I love gardening as well. What do grow in your garden? My hair is short and quite straight, wish it was more curly"
4123,Just some herbs like basil and mint I also grow some vegetables when the weather is right
4123,"That's great! Mint and basil are great aromatically and tasteful as well. We have a garden as well, with cucumbers, tomatoes, and peppers"
4123,When I'm not obsessing over my hair I often prepare salads. What do you use you plants for?
4123,"Salads as well. I love a good greek salad. But we also do salsa, pickles, burgers with tomatoes"
4123,"Thats cool, I also love a good burger"
4123,"What kind of toppings do you like? I like tomatoes, onions, hot sauce, and avocado "
4123,"I like corn, lettuce and cucumbes"
4123,"Yum, I am getting hungry with all these talk of food!"
4123,Yeah whats your favorite combination of foods
4123,"Anything fresh really. I do a lot of fish and vegetables, mediterranean, and french. Yourself?"
4123,I mostly eat Nigerian soups with a yam based dipping bread called fufu
4123,"I have not heard of fufu, but it sounds like it would go well with soups"
4124,Miami.
4124,Nice! There's lots of good vegan restaurants in Miami if you're into that kind of thing.
4124,"I love vegetables. Actually, I'm a vegetarian. "
4124,"That's great! Bob Ross was too. He's my favorite, omg"
4124,You mean the painter Bob Ross?
4124,Yes! Greatest artist of all time to be honest!
4124,I never bought his artwork. It's too expensive.
4124,"Expensive, but worth it. To me, at least. I have about 15 pieces so far."
4124,When did you get the first piece if you don't mind?
4124,In 2005! I've been collecting for a while. Do you collect anything?
4124,"That's awesome. Yeah, I collect stamps."
4124,My brother collects stamps. How big is your collection?
4125,very interesting
4125,"He's an incredibly interesting man.  Did you know he had some very early sketches of his idea of the helicopter, all the way back in the fifteenth century?"
4125,I have heard he had many inventions drawn up but never brought to life. Truly a man ahead of his time.
4125,It's actually crazy! He was also a sculptor and an architect!
4125,Do you have a favorite work of his?
4125,I can't say that I have a fav. Do you?
4125,"No, I haven't seen anything but his most famous works. I would like to look into his inventions more."
4125,You know some people say he was an alien because of how far ahead of his time he truly was.
4125,I actually saw that on a cartoon once. Kind of funny!
4125,What cartoon was it?
4125,Futurama
4125,Absolutely love Futurama.  One of my favorite cartoons of all time.
4126,what do you do for a living?
4126,"I'm a graphic designer, I consider myself somewhat of a perfectionist, so my work takes quite a bit of my time getting it to where I want it."
4126,yeah I can understand taking no days off with that job
4126,"I do feel like I need a vacation sometimes though, they can be really beneficial to your mental health."
4126,you should make some time for it.
4126,I'm trying to. What about you? Have you given yourself a vacation in a while?
4126,yeah i'm finally goin on vacation next week for once
4126,"That's awesome to hear, where are you off to? "
4126,i'm travelling to miami
4126,"That sounds like fun, depending on where you are currently, could be a huge change in weather! It's getting colder here in the Midwest already.."
4126,yeah I live in the carolinas so that would be a slight weather change
4126,"That'll be fun, I hope you have a good time in Miami then, enjoy the time off from work/typical routine!"
4127,Thank you. I'm not sure how excited I am.
4127,That is really a big happening in your life.
4127,I know. Its just that we live in Florida and I want to move. She won't want to.
4127,You don
4127,She will not want to leave her mother now.
4127,"I see.  Well, having her mom around will be a big help.  Especially while she is pregnant."
4127,True. But I love to explore. I wanted to move to the West Coast.
4127,"The west coast is nice, especially San Diego.  That is my favorite U.S. city"
4127,I've been thinking about California for a long time. I guess that is out of the question now. 
4127,"Well, she might change mind after the child is born.  You can always try to convince her."
4127,I'm certainly going to try! I guess I can keep myself grounded her in Florida another year or 2
4127,"Yes, well, Florida is better than Sioux City, Iowa, that's for sure.  lol"
4128,I just wanted to have some fun.
4128,That's a good thing that it wasn't another type of drink!
4128,The rum tasted good.
4128,"haha , what else do you do for fun ?"
4128,Watch netflix.
4128,I wish I had time for netflix nowadays! Just last week I got a job cleaning gutters.
4128,Cool...
4128,Yeah i'm either doing that or at the archery range most days haha !
4128,That's interesting
4128,I like shooting arrows at targets but not really at anything living!
4128,"Yeah, for sure."
4128,"well, anyways gotta dip! my archery class starts in 30min !"
4129,"I quickly tried to cover myself up and i fast walked it to the locker room, it was quite embarassing "
4129, haha did you lose any sleep that night? because of that?
4129,"Oh absolutley its kinda seared in my brain, but i had to be quite early the next morning so that was fun. "
4129,haha so what did your friends think?
4129,they tried to console me and tell me it was no big deal but it sure felt like it haha
4129,what would you do different next time? so that doesn't happen.
4129,"Well i would definelty make sure my swim gear is more secured, i never thought that would happen "
4129,"now if it happens again, it can now be your signature move. hahaha "
4129,Yeah i really cant think of something better to be known for haha
4129,haha i bet someone got you on camera. you should request the footage. send it to the world funniest videos.
4129,"That is a great idea, i opened a restraunt a few years later so everyone can come see me and make fun of me haha"
4129,really? how do you like it? 
4130,"Oh wow, I didn't know that. It's a strong name to live up to."
4130,Yes it is.  Some of the characters must be inspired by people the creators liked.
4130,I've noticed that too. I wish those people were in my life!
4130,Do you partake in any sports?
4130,For sure. I like watching more but I shoot hoops whenever I can. How about you?
4130,"I'm more of a sidelines person myself too, but recently started taking archery classes.  It is hard work."
4130,I haven't done archery since camp as a teenager. It's probably a great upper body workout.
4130,It is especially good if you want to develope the strength and size of your muscles
4130,Do you just go to the woods to practice or are there designated places?
4130,the woods and there is an archery center near my house .
4130,I may see if my brother still has an archery set and go in the woods behind my moms home. I need to get out of comic magazines.
4130,It's nice to take a break from things like comics once and awhile but if you enjoy them then its not hurting anyone. 
4131,I always think of Prince when i think of purple or even the movie the color purple.
4131,Roman magistrates used to wear purple and it was worn by rulers of the Byzantine Empire and Holy Roman Empire - so it's a pretty fancy color LOL!
4131,I also think of the Raptors the basketball team
4131,Funny you say that.  I think of the Los Angeles Lakers!
4131,"Booo i dont like the lakers, they had a great run dont get me wrong just not my favorite"
4131,LOL I'm not a fan of NBA that much but I do know I don't like Golden State
4131,LOL yea im not a huge fan of it anymore either. Its allabout money at this point.
4131,Feels like the whole world revolves around money at this point.
4131,Yea thats for sure thats a definite. its unfortunate but it is what it is.
4131,Mo money mo problems
4131,LOL thats always it. Id still take a bag or two if they are donatating to the cause
4131,"Oh yeah for sure.  That's the real problem.  No one likes that money runs everything, but no one's saying no to a huge sack of cash."
4132,"Yeah, badly."
4132,Sorry. Why didn't you go with them?
4132,I had to work.
4132,Oh. Well is everybody back together now?
4132,"Yeah, everyone is back home now."
4132,So what is your job that you couldn't leave. I work at Sears.
4132,I work at Walmart. I'm a Network Administrator. 
4132,Cool. Sears is pretty shaky financially. I am trying to break into journalism.
4132,What happened to Sears?
4132,"Well, you know, they"
4132,Are you serious you're trying to break into journalism?
4132,Yes. Sears has been suffering losses for a while and has closed stores. I have a degree in Journalism.
4133,Mine is green my 3 kids fav. color is purple
4133,"That's fun, I've always liked purple too, your kids have great taste haha"
4133,"Yeah thanks, my other favorite thing is to sing"
4133,"That's cool, I wish I could sing better. I'm a social person, love talking, but can't use my voice to sing well"
4133,Yeah thats a problem for alot of people but with alot of practice you can become good at it
4133,"Hmm, thanks for the motivation! Maybe I'll up my shower singing game haha"
4133,Yeah its definitely what helped me
4133,"That's nice to hear, do you have a favorite music genre?"
4133,Pop and hiphop is what I enjoy singing the most
4133,"Hip-hop is good, that may be my favorite as well, I'm not too picky when it comes to music honestly "
4133,Can I ask you a personal question? Do you have any kids?
4133,"I don't unfortunately, it is something I would like in the future though "
4133,"Yeah, well I have 3 and I couldn't love them more"
4134,We felt like we could have more control on what they would learn
4134,That makes sense. Do either of you have a background in teaching or how did you learn to do that?
4134,"No neither of us do. However, we have both studied to college level. I spent a lot of time reading about what homeschooling entails before actually pursuing it."
4134,That makes sense. I am looking to become a music teacher myself when I retire so I am looking for helpful tips
4134,Thats wonderful. What instruments do you play or do you sing?
4134,I wish I could sing! I play the piano and guitar
4134,That's great. Do you have any children or nieces and nephews? Perhaps you could start with teaching them. 
4134,I do. We have a new born and a few younger nieces. That is a good idea and probably something I will try. How old are your kids?
4134,Congratulations! Boy or girl? We have 5 and 7 year old boys
4134,Thank you! It is a boy. He's 6 months old and doing well. Congrats on your two as well. I hear it gets easier at some point..
4135,I found some princess dolls.
4135,"Oh that is awesome.  What little girl, maybe besides me as a child, doesn't love princess dolls?"
4135,"So true, they were something I loved as a child and it's a joy to pass them down. What did you like as a child?"
4135,"We stayed outdoors.  I was pure tomboy, so we did a lot of rock climbing and sports."
4135,"That's fun, I had a friend that was very similar. Any sports in particular that you enjoyed?"
4135,"I love yard football.  Unfortunately, it just wasn't acceptable for a girl to play so I started rock climbing more as a teen."
4135,"Oh I see, that is a shame you couldn't always join in. Did you live somewhere mountainous that made you want to rock climb?"
4135,"Yes, we were near Zion National Park in Utah."
4135,I bet that was a very nice area. I love flowers and I'm sure that area has some incredibly pretty flowers.
4135,"Yes, there are some really pretty ones.  Allergies get me with them sometimes though, well the Lavender blooms and gluten allergies."
4135,Ah that is a shame. It's sad that something so pretty can cause such uncomfortable symptoms for some people.
4135,"Yes.  Thankfully I'm not allergic to the state flower, the Sego Lily.  It's my favorite."
4135,"That's good you can enjoy that flower. I'm not very familiar with that flower, but I'm sure it's really pretty!"
4136,"Well, that sounds like a nice drive. Driving in the country clears the mind."
4136,The country was quite a sight my brothers and i try to make the drive every year 
4136,I'm quite jealous!
4136,"You have to get out there sometime, would that be something youre into?"
4136,Definitely. I love to take breaks at gas stations and read books from many series. 
4136,Yeah part of the roadtrip trip is the small side stuff you do on the way like that stuff
4136,Driving in my Camaro down the country side is the best.
4136,"Oh very nice car, yeah i try to get out for a mental break due to my classes being quite difficult"
4136,"Well, you should be studying right now! I have to get to work, bye!"
4136,Very true ill get to it
4136,"Alright then, hope we meet again."
4136,me aswell have a good one
4137,"I love to learn  new things, but I have trouble retaining dates. Events not so much  "
4137,I can understand that. Once out of school you have to have a passion for keeping up on that. What books do you like?
4137,lately I have been reading mostly heath and wellness books. I have 8 grandchildren so I want to be around as long as possible.
4137,Smart! I read a little bit of everything - love self help and family magazines. I'm getting married soon so of course bridal mags.
4137,Oh how exciting! Have you set a date?
4137,"Yes, December 31st. I still have so much work to do. "
4137,It's coming up fast! Are you planning a big event or something more intimate?
4137,there will be 200 guest. My fiance and I both have large families - but it will be a great way to bring in New Year.
4137,That will be a great start the year being surrounded by lots of family. Are you  getting married indoors or outside?
4137,Indoors. I work for our local theater company so we are using it.
4137,That's so nice that you have a tie to the venue. My daughter got married at my parents farm and they celebrate their anniversary there every year 
4137,a farm sounds lovely. We thought about rustic but couldn't find a venue.
4138,I like math a lot.
4138,Cool I'm a science guy myself.
4138,I like science also. What part of science do you like the best?
4138,Chemistry. And you?
4138,I took my first course in Chemistry last year. I liked it but had to study a lot.
4138,oh ok. Are you single?
4138,"Yes, I'm only 15."
4138,Cool. I'm living the single life. just wanted to know what kind of person I'm speaking with.
4138,"Sure, how old are you?"
4138,"19, in college"
4138,I plan on going to college. How do you like it?
4138,It's very fun. You'll like it
4139,I don't. I was parked in the parking lot and probably who was ever next to me. 
4139,"That's a shame to hear, try looking for security footage nearby, maybe cameras caught something."
4139,That's a really good idea. Thanks! Have you ever experienced any sort of hit and run?
4139,"I have not thankfully, it sounds like it could be a real headache though!"
4139,Definitely! Do you like art? Sometimes I think about being an artist. 
4140,"Wow, you talk in a surreal way. I like it."
4140,I love red! It brings out my spicy personality.
4140,"I'll bet. Well I had polio as a child and can't walk, but my upper body is super strong."
4140,I'm so happy to hear you have managed to live a fullfilling life?
4140,Thank you. I had my wheelchair custom painted red. We probably are a little alike.
4140,For sure! Do you have a red car? I have a red corvette!
4140,"No. I don't have a car, but that corvette has to be a beauty. I mostly wheel myself to the park and shoot baskets."
4140,Basketball is my favorite sport to watch!
4140,I'm really accurate with my shots. I've applied for a motorized wheelchair. I will be hell on wheels.
4140,I bet! That's so inspirational! Now when I wear my red purse I will think of you! 
4140,So cool. I'm going to have the motorized chair painted red in honor of you.
4140,I love that! Cool!
4140,What basketball team do you follow?
4141,"Of course they did! All I heard for a week afterward was, ""Hide the candy!"""
4141,"Well in that case, I guess I better start hiding!"
4141,Lol...it'll be less likely to happen this year. I've gone full vegan and there's not a lot of vegan candy being given out!
4141,Vegan food is definitely getting better - I have a vegan friend who provides me with chocolate every now and again which is actually pretty tasty!
4141,I have been pleasantly surprised by the amount of really good vegan food there is! I never would have thought I would like a veggie burger!
4142,Sometimes the fake checks are just advertisements. Something must have stood out about this one.
4142,Maybe this one isn't bogus!  Have you looked into it further?
4142,That's the crazy thing. My fiance says it's not bogus! I would never have noticed it's from my old company
4142,That's amazing.  I wish my old company would send me a cheque.  I recently switched jobs to working in a factory and I'm still not sure about it/.
4142,"Ah. Yeah, I would hate to work in a factory. I like to be active everyday."
4142,"Being active is great, but factory work is so tiring that I have no energy left over to have fun at the end of the day"
4142,I can imagine. I need to get a run in everyday in order to feel like myself. Why did you switch jobs?
4142,It was too hard to turn down the wage increase but I'm definitely keeping my options open for something a little less hard on my body.
4142,I wish you luck! You spend too long at a job everyday to not enjoy it. Life is too short.
4142,"Yeah. A job is better than no job, I suppose."
4142,"True, you do need to put a roof over your head. But you need a reason to smile every day too."
4142,At least my dog and kid make me smile.  What makes you smile?
4143,She doesnt get that uggs are winter apparel and not all year.
4143,"Oh, I see. But I don't like UGG."
4143,Oh trust i dont either. They are not trending anymore.
4143,I agree. I love the Nike Air.
4143,i love the Nike Air MAx 270. Those are pretty sweet. Jordans will always be my favorite though.
4143,When did you get your first Nike Air Max 270 if you don't mind?
4143,I got my first two pair last year i think maybe it was early this year.
4143,That's awesome. Do you still wear then now?
4143,Yes i do they are one of my favorites. They are really comfortable. Do you still have your Nike's?
4143,I think so. But I don't have them now.
4143,"Oh i see, maybe you should look into a new pair. Its almost christmas time lol."
4143,"Yeah, I guess I should think about that. Christmas is coming."
4144,I remember my mother telling me that the mortgage on our four bedroom house was only $100 a month
4144,wow thats so little ! i could cook a nice little meal for $100
4144,"Yeah, she tells me all kinds of stories, like how you could buy a loaf of bread for 15 cent and you could go to the movies for a quarter."
4144,I could have so much more fun with my kids ! even though they are all mostly grown now haha
4144,Yeah.  I call those the good old days.  Money went a long way and there was less stress about money
4144,yeah its so much worse now that i'm so worried about the future
4144,"Things are so uncertain.  Sometimes, I want to go live on a farm and grow my own food ."
4144,I could REALLY get to cooking if i had my own farm !!
4144,"I actually own thirteen acres of land in South Carolina, I just don't have to nerve to move down there"
4144,Oh boy do i wish i were you lol
4144,"I think about doing it, but I know it will be a lot of work."
4144,Yeah but in the end it'll be so satisfying because you know you're the one responsible
4144,That is very true.  I might still consider it.
4144,"well anyways, i gotta start on dinner for my boys see you soon!"
4144,Okay.  Take care
4145,"I started taking piano lessons when I was a child because I heard that Alexander McQueen did, lol"
4145,You have some really nice idols! Did you know his dad was a Scottish taxi driver?
4145,Lol that's cool. I hate taking taxis in NYC. I prefer to take the train or Uber.
4145,There isn't an Uber around this area.  
4145,What?! Where do you live?
4145,"A very Southern, rural area that's kind of behind on the times.  It makes being a vegetarian very difficult."
4145,That's crazy. Almost everyone at my college in NYC is vegetarian it seems like haha.
4145,"It kind of limits food choices, but it's great when you have the ability to grow your own food."
4145,It's all concrete here. That's the one thing I hate about the city.
4145,"I couldn't imagine not having shade trees and grass, but it gets really hot here.  Concrete tends to absorb heat and make it worse."
4145,It actually never gets too hot here. The humidity is low too.
4145,The humidity here is like hot soup! Lol
4146,Really? Well whats your favorite one? 
4146,"That's a tough one. I have a read a lot of them, but they are all mostly good. She's a good writer. Do you enjoy reading?"
4146,"Yes I do, I read while on my shift at the grocery store, I also read when I visit my friend in the big city."
4146,That is a smart use of time while you have down time at the store. What do you like to read
4146,"I like to read fiction, usually apocalyptic fiction and dystopian as well"
4146,I see. Those definitely creative and interesting thoughts into what the future could look like
4146,"Yeah, I just really like them, one reason for the plot, the other to take me away from the monotony of my grocery store job"
4146,Sorry you aren't busy enough at the grocery store and you have that much time to kill
4146,"Nah, its ok gives me more time to let me think of stuff"
4146,What else do you like to think about besides books?
4146,I guess what I would say to my friend who lives far away in the big city
4146,What big city? I like visiting San Diego
4146,She live in Las Angeles
4146,Yes that is quite a big city. I went there once and it was very busy
4146,How did you like it?
4146,I liked visiting it and seeing all it had to offer. But the traffic was always horrendous. 
4146,Yeah but thats big citites for you :/
4146,"True. I am from a rural area, so it's always a shock to me"
4146,So whats your job like
4146,I work in marketing. It's kinda cut throat sometimes.
4146,"Lol I would expect that, but at least its not boring"
4146,It can be. Dealing with clients who dont know what they truly want is the worst and makes for long projects
4146,"I know its the same with old people who try to pay by check in the grocery store, like why are they like this"
4146,It is rough and I am not looking forward to when I get that old too. But I have to run to meet a friend. Good chatting with you!
4146,bye
4146,Have a good day
4147,I used to be in them.  They are very competitive.
4147,"Nice, I think they can be cool but some parents may take them too far"
4147,"I haven't thought about them in a while, since I just have Owen.  "
4147,Owen is your son?
4147,"Yes, he's four.  No way would I put him through a pageant."
4147,"Haha, I understand, it would be very stressful"
4147,I don't like the way they dress the girls too mature for the pageants.  Babies shouldn't wear lipstick.
4147,"Yeah, I've always thought it was a little much myself"
4147,It was that bad when I did them.  I hated the makeup! I just wanted to play basketball.
4147,I hope your parents let you play at one point!
4147,They finally did after middle school.
4147,"Fun, did you have a good time on the team?"
4148,He's feeling a little bit better now. Did you have a similar experience?
4148,"Yes I have three dogs, so I have woke up to some surprises. What kind of dog is it?"
4148,It's a pug. It's a gift for my daughter's 10th birthday. And yours?
4148,I
4148,I don't quite get your reply. Are your three dogs of the same breeD?
4148,I've heard they have sensitive stomachs. I have three lab mixes.
4148,It can get expensive to take them to the vet. I sell paper products for a living so I'm not earning much. You?
4148,I work in Advertising from home. Only part time so I understand that. Luckily my dogs have not had any major issues
4148,"That's handy. You get to spend more time with the family and of course, your dogs. They're lovely."
4148,/Yes! My kids are young so it allows me to have more free time for them. do you have children?
4148,I have one daughter. We're still trying for another. She'll be so upset if our dog won't get better soon.
4148,I bet! Our dogs are our family
4149,It was definitely a horrific event. I couldnt imagine being at the front lines at a time like that.
4149,Me neither. I probably would have tried to dodge the draft to be honest.
4149,Yea thats a definite. Do you think the draft will ever make a return?
4149,"I think so, maybe. My band actually has a song called World War II and the lyrics are about this stuff."
4149,Yea i think so too! Oh wow really thats cool! What kind of band.
4149,Rock. We're a local band in a tiny town but we wanna be big someday.
4149,"Oh Yessss! Nice thats awesome, hey the sky is the limit."
4149,True! What kind of music do you like?
4149,"I love all type of music, oldies, R&B, some Rap, rock, even country and jazz. "
4149,Same here! My favorite genres are definitely rock and pop however.
4149,I hear that for sure. I like to switch it up from time to time.
4149,Definitely. Who is your favorite artist?
4150,I know what keeps me satisfied - food!
4150,What kind of food is your favorite?
4150,"By far homemade steak and potatoes. Takes practice, but once you got it mastered you'd want it every night."
4150,Can't go wrong with steak and potato. One of the classics! The right vegetables can really make a dish also.
4150,"When I've got guests I pull out some butter-cooked asparagus, goes well with the beefy steak!"
4150,Butter seems to be a popular choice. I've also heard of people using cheese.
4150,"I have tried cheese, guest told me she liked it but I could tell on her face she thought quite the opposite."
4150,"Have you tried alternative cheese, such as that from a sheep?"
4150,"I try to stay true to the cow, never strayed away."
4150,"Traditional wisdom doesn't fail here. As I work in marketing, it is my nature to ask which alternatives people like and dislike."
4150,"I see, well I hope most people prefer cow over sheep."
4150,"That is correct, but it does seem to vary by country also."
4151,I'm headed down to the Florida Keys. It'll be a nice change of weather from the cold of New York.
4151,"That will be a pleasant change, I've been a lot of time in Pensacola, Florida. I've never been to the Keys."
4151,"Is it nice in Pensacola? This will be my first time in Florida, so I'm looking forward to visiting somewhere new."
4151,"Yes, especially the beaches. The sand is white & soft, and emerald colored water. Do you have any activities planned?"
4151,"That sounds so pretty, especially the water! Yes, one of the first things I'm going to do is snorkling. Hope to see lots of sea-life."
4151,That will be fun and exciting! I hear it is a great place to snorkel and maybe you'll get lucky and see a sea turtle!
4151,"Yes, that would be cool to see! I hope it'll be a good day for snorkling. Did you ever snorkel when you were in Pensacola?"
4151,When I was younger I did but just off the shore. Mostly saw tiny fish. Will you be going on a boat to go somewhere to snorkel?
4151,"That sounds fun! Yes, I'm hoping on one of the trips to go out to where the continental shelf drops off. I think it would be interesting to see that."
4151,That would be interesting! And I bet there is all kinds of sea life by there. How long are you staying?
4151,"That's what I am hoping! I will be there for a little under two weeks, so hopefully plenty of time to see a lot."
4151,Oh yeah that should give you plenty of time! I'm hoping to go on vacation soon once the semester is over.
4151,Hopefully you can spend some time somewhere nice and relax! School can be so stressful.
4152,"Thank you.  But, I have learned to live with it."
4152,"That's really the best thing that you can do, only so much is in your control."
4152,"Yeah, people say look on the bright side, but I don't know if there is a bright side.  It's just about moving forward."
4152,"That's true, there are plenty of effective coping methods, but nothing ever truly fixes the pain "
4152,I have tried hobbies.  I am learning to paint.  That takes my mind off things.
4152,"That's good to hear, yes hobbies can help ease your mind when times are the toughest "
4152,It eases my mind and I am also finding that I am good at it.  I had a hidden talent.
4152,Sometimes there is a bright side then! You may not have found that talent otherwise.
4152,"That is what I keep telling myself.  I don't know if I should be thankful or not, though"
4153,"Thank you! I hope so too. Do you have any pets? I have a dog, but like cats too"
4153,I have a dog too! What breed is yours?
4153,Black lab puppy. What about you!
4153,"Australian red healer, I love her <3"
4153,I have never heard of that. Is it a small dog?
4153,"She's medium sized. You should look up some pictures, they're really fun and playful"
4153,Yes I will do that! I like learning new things
4153,"Me too, do you play any instruments?"
4153,Unfortunately I don't. I wish I could though. Do you?
4153,"I can play the trombone, although not as good as my mother could play piano"
4153,That's awesome! Were you ever in a marching band or where do you play it?
4153,"I was in marching band, however I played the baritone their because my director said we needed more space"
4153,Well that's good that you could play different things to accommodate the band
4154,I like to work in my garden now.  It's relaxing.
4154,"Yeah, sometimes it's relaxing to be out there cutting the grass by yourself. How often do work on it?"
4154,"Every day.  I grow mushrooms for my pizza! Did you know there are over 10,000 types?"
4154,Oh wow! I didn't know that. I only know the ones I see at the supermarkets. 
4154,I've studied up on them once I started the garden.  I also grow cucumbers to make sushi with.
4154,That is amazing! Fresh vegetables are the way to go. I assume you like to cook?
4154,"I really do.  As you can probably tell, sushi and pizza are favorites.  What about you?"
4154,"I don't really have a favorite, but you know what annoys me about sushi? People always confuse it with sashimi."
4154,"Oh I know.  Then you try to explain the difference, and they don't listen."
4154,"That's right. Aside from cooking, I love travelling. My next goal is to go to Asia. "
4154,Asia would be lovely to visit.  I would love to see Angkor Wat in Cambodia.
4154,"I would too. I'd love to see all of East Asia, but especially Japan."
4155,Yeah! We have a great roster and I know we're gonna win a lot.
4155,Sure thing. I try to watch as much as I can while I grade papers.
4155,"I love to sit down, watch sports, and smell my own farts."
4155,lol. you sound like one of students.
4155,Lol! What do you like to do besides watch sports?
4155,I like to eat apples but I'm not supposed to.
4155,Why aren't you supposed to? I'm not supposed to drink a ton of beer but I do anyways.
4155,I'm allergic. you seem like a fun person
4155,Thank you for saying that. You seem really kind.
4155,I've had a lot of training with my students lol.
4155,That makes sense! I guess I'm a bit childish sometimes :p
4155,"It's cool, we all are in some way."
4156,"Nice, I went to Miami when I went"
4156,Very nice. What did you do in Miami? I love to go fishing now that I am down here
4156,"I mostly just walked around and relaxed, my fiance isn't big on the outdoors stuff"
4156,It's not for everyone. Glad you were still able to relax while you were there though and get away for a bit
4156,"Yeah, it's always nice. And we found a surprisingly clean place that allowed pets!"
4156,What kind of pet do you have? I know most places don't allow pets so that is good!
4156,I have a french bulldog.
4156,Cute! I love bulldogs
4156,"They're so cute, I love them"
4156,"Bulldogs are pretty aggressive, though! During WWII, they were likened to Winston Churchill. Found that to be an interesting fact"
4156,"Really, I never knew about that!"
4156,"Yes, it was in a book I was reading, and it stuck with me"
4157,What do you like the most about the simes?
4157,"I love the interactive aspect of it, I also love how they constantly update the game."
4157,Tha pretending aspect Is what I value most in a game
4158,i plan on going to Disney world! i only went there once as a kid!
4158,Nice! Walt Disney world has multiple locations right?
4158,"yes! there is Disney Land in CA, And Disney World in Orlando, Florida, it takes me back to being a kid, when i wanted to be an astronaut! "
4158,"That sounds super fun, I love florida and orlando its quite awesome."
4158,"yes, Love it to! do you know who penn teller is? hes my favorite magician!"
4158,Oh yes ive definitely heard of them. My favorite i criss angel
4158,whoa! sweet! mine to! Street Magic would alway's keep me up late night watching reruns haha
4158,Yea thats awesome. Yea ive definitely had some late nights watching too. I have never been to a live magic show. Thats on my bucket list.
4158,What! You don't know what your missing! ahah make that a goal for yourself in 2020!
4158,I know im definitely going to pencil that in for sure. Who have you seen live?
4158,Just locals! nobody famous! like houdini or something!
4158,oh ok i got ya hey thats still better than nothing.
4159,I have seen those.  I think the one model is called a Spyder.
4159,A friend got a used one for a good price.
4159,"I think they are cool looking.  But, I think I would be afraid to have one."
4159,"Yes, me to. They look dangerous."
4159,"When I was a kid, my neighbors' son had a chopper, like the one in Easy Rider.  He offered me a ride once but I was afraid."
4159,I to am too afraid to ride on a chopper. The noise scares me. 
4159,"Yeah, it was pretty loud.  But, still super cool."
4159,They are very graceful and powerful. The power feels amazing. 
4159,"My uncle had a Harley, I remember.  My aunt made him get rid of it."
4159,"My farther had a Harley, he used to love working on it."
4159,"I remember, that was a beautiful machine.  Like a work of art."
4159,Yes it is. I wish that I could have one. The way it purrs under neath you feels so good.
4160,Which music is your favorite?  I love seeing Country live in concert.
4160,I love pop music because it's so much fun. I LOVE concerts! I like Christian music too.
4160,"You have good taste, it sounds like.  Did you know going to concerts is supposed to help you live longer?"
4160,I know that my Christian concerts at least help me live longer! I love being around other true believers. Do you believe in God?
4160,"Yes, I do.  I work a lot so don't attend service as much as I should, but I live alone so I have to pay bills."
4160,I understand that completely. I'll pray for your financial situation!
4160,"Thank you very much.  Everyone could use extra prayers, I believe. "
4160,"Of course. Now I have Kesha's song ""Praying"" stuck in my head! I love Kesha."
4160,"I don't think I have heard that one, but there is one called Unanswered Prayers by Garth Brooks that I relate to."
4160,I know that song and I love it too.
4160,It's a lovely song.  It really makes you think.
4160,"True. Ok, I have to go to bible study now. It was nice chatting with you!"
4161,When I swim I just swim the regular freestyle way.
4161,Like how my dad would swim away from his child support payments.
4161,I'm sorry to hear that. That must have been tough.
4161,It was pretty rough. It was almsot as rough as when Kurt Cobain died when I was in middle school.
4161,I've heard of him. He died before I was born. Did you like him a lot?
4161,Yeah he was a way cooler guy than my deadbeat dad.
4161,When is the last time you saw your dad?
4161,The last time I saw my dad was 2013. He wasn't much of a Nirvana fan.
4161,That's tough. I'm sorry to hear that.
4161,"Thank you, it's okay though. Life goes on."
4161,It does. I still live with my parents. I'm in college.
4161,"That's cool. Good luck in college. It's hard work, but it's worth the struggle."
4162,"I am in a coworking space, so it is pretty loud"
4162,That is too bad.   I can understand why you want something soft.
4162,"Yes, it's peaceful and drowns out the others. What kind of music do you like?"
4162,I like country music and jazz.
4162,"I love country! Who are your favorite bands? I like Zac Brown, Eric Church, and Jason aldean, among others"
4162,I really like George Strait.
4162,Classic and very good too. I would have loved to have grown up in his generation and seen him in his prime
4162,Fortunately the records are still around!
4162,Yes that is true! Garth brooks is also pretty good
4162,"Garth Brooks is very good, except that strange record"
4162,Which one?
4162,The one where he pretended to be somebody else.
4162,I dont think I have heard that one
4163,My cat's name is Fumble. She is so cute and great off the leash. Do you own any pets?
4163,"No, but my sister had a grey house cat called Mickey, he was an indoor cat."
4163,"Pets are great, they keep you active and grounded. Do you have any hobbies?"
4163,I like to travel and one day build a house by the beach. Do you see yourself doing that?
4163,"Probably not, I don't think I would be to afford that. I traveled to France and Spain earlier this year. Have you been?"
4163,"No, I have never been but I hope I am able to one day. What do yo do for a living?"
4163,"I'm an electrician, I just got my license last summer. How about you?"
4163, I'm a landscaper. How long have you been working as an electrician?
4163,It's been close to 6 years. Very rewarding to finally be done with my apprenticeship! 
4163,That is great. I've been working as a landscaper for 20 years now. It's tough work but I'm getting by.
4163,"Yes, it's always great in our occupations to be able to stand back and admire the work we did. Not that many people can do that."
4163,"True, though interacting with people and having to be friendly with them seems exhausting sometimes."
4163,I hear you. It's tough talking trade with people who don't really have a concept of that.
4164,Mostly just looking at me.
4164,Maybe they like you?
4164,"Perhaps, but I have not experienced such glances before."
4164,"If you don't them to be clingy, just don't respond in any way, you know? Do not smile."
4164,I will try to be more aloof.   Thank you!
4164,"that's no problem, just be nice anyway."
4164,Thank you for your good advice.    Maybe you can help my golf game too!
4164,"golf? being a truck driver, it's too mellow and slow for me of a game! I do love mini golf though "
4164,I can never do the last hole when playing with kids.
4164,"how many kids do you have, and how old are they?"
4164,I have one - eight years old.
4164,that is fantastic! perfect age to discover the world. you ever take them camping? I love my weekends camping.
4165,"Usually 35 SPF. Luckily, I tan more than I burn."
4165,"That's good that you don't usually burn much! I'm the opposite, I always burn unless I use loads of sunscreen. What do you like to do at the beach?"
4165,"I enjoy body boarding, reading, napping, playing bocce ball or flying a kite. What about you?"
4165,"Ohh those sound fun! I like sports on the beach a lot. I'm always up for volleyball, soccer, bocce ball, or anything really."
4165,I enjoy volleyball and soccer on the beach as well. What beach is your favorite?
4165,Hmm that's a hard question with so many nice beaches. I got to travel to the Florida Keys once and I loved the crystal clear water. What is yours?
4165,"I hear Florida Keys is beautiful. I haven't been to too many different beaches. But it would either be at Belize or Pensacola, FL"
4165,"I've heard those are very nice, Florida definitely has some nice beaches with such white sand and pretty water! Do you get to go to Belize often?"
4165,"Yes the sand and water are beautiful. No, I've only been once and that was several years ago. Only problem is you have to worry about piranhas!."
4165,Ah I didn't know about the piranhas there. That sounds a bit terrifying! Are they fairly common there?
4165,"It some areas, they say don't wear anything shiny and they'll be more scared of you. But on shore it was beautiful!"
4165,I would definitely make sure I did not even pack anything remotely shiny! Outside of the piranhas it sounds very wonderful there!
4166,Some kind of pipe underground exploded I believe. I don't think anyone was hurt but it was certainly scary.
4166,That sounds like a poor Halloween trick!
4167,I have usually about 6 cats that come and go.
4167,Are they stray cats?
4167,"Usually, I'll just go out for a drink with friends, find one, and keep it."
4167,Do you like to talk to strangers?
4167,"Sometimes, but my cats love it."
4167,Is your favourite animal a cat?
4167,"I prefer them to dogs, how about you?"
4167,I prefer cats to be honest.
4167,Sometimes I also like to go out drinking with starngers' cats.
4167,What do you like to do in your spare time?
4167,"In my spare, I can usually be found drinking with my friends and enjoying cats."
4167,Do you like to watch cat videos?
4168,"Yeah, male pattern baldness runs in my family. It's the same condition that I have I guess."
4168,Have you considered talking to a doctor about it?
4168,No. It's just genetics. Nothing will help it. It's why my mother doesn't love me
4168,Well hopefully you get a few more good years out of it before it gets really bad.
4168,I doubt it. It's getting bad.
4168,Are you considering shaving it bald and try out that look?
4168,"Maybe. That might look nice on me, huh?"
4168,I think its worth a try.  Some ladies like the bald look.
4168,Yeah. It's worth a shot.
4168,"You can do it.  It worked for Michael Jordan, Bruce Willis and Jason Stathem."
4168,Yeah. Do you think it'll help my mother to love?
4168,"Maybe,  if not she might just enjoy smacking you on the back of your bald head . :)"
4169,So what do you do for fun outside of work? I watch a lot of Battlestar Galactica.
4169,I just do a lot of reading.  I think that has always been my favorite thing to do.
4169,"Reading is nice, although I don't read as much as I probably should.  Who is your favorite author?"
4169,"To tell you the truth, who I like to read the most is Agatha Christie.  "
4169,"Oh, I love her.  The mysteries are so nice."
4169,"Yeah, I love mysteries and I like the time that her books were set.  So, much more refined and romantic."
4169,"For sure.  It's not gritty like stuff today.  Since moving to the beet farm, I have had a little time to read."
4169,The only other beet farmer I have heard of is Dwight from The Office.  lol
4169,"Lol, I really like that show too.  It's definitely an unusual job, but I love it."
4169,Part of my family is from the Philippines and they were tobacco farmers.
4169,I have heard that is very had work.  I didn't want to have to get the license to do that.  Too many rules.
4169,"It is very hard work, over there, because a lot of the farms are still ox powered. "
4170,Oh i find that very sad :(
4170,Do you like eating beef? I think it's just a fantastic activity.
4170,no i prefer tacos with very hot sauce
4170,I like to eat beef with my boots on.
4170,Do you have twitter or snapchat?
4170,"I only have boots, and beef. My beef boots."
4170,i enjoy ittoo
4170,"Do you ever put beef in your boot, and then eat the boot?"
4170,no i find that discusting
4170,"That's good, no one has ever answered ""yes""."
4170,Why do you like cow so much? why not the milk
4170,I have this odd fixation with beef. It's all I eat.
4170,oh that would be an odd diet
4171,"Yeah,  its not trendy but you gotta dress warm for those hikes this time of year."
4171,How often do you go hiking?
4171,I do short hikes at least once a week this time of year.  Its the best time.
4171,It sounds like a great activity!   Do you go alone?
4171,Sometimes I can talk the wife into coming with me to take a few photos
4171,That sounds like fun!    Is she a good photographer?
4171,She is pretty good.  The changing leaf colors makes for some pretty nature photos. 
4171,The fall is my favorite time of year!
4171,"Mine too.  Its not too hot, not too cold and it leads into the holiday season."
4171,Snow is nice too if it is only a little cold.
4171,"Yeah,  it gives me a good reason to stay in and sit by the fire."
4171,Partners also like to snuggle!
4172,"Yeah, I'm always out shopping with my daughters and they love to pick out their favorite, the purple one I believe?"
4172,"I always love to look at all of them when I'm out shopping, there are so many different colors. They're all so pretty! Especially Rainbow Dash!"
4172,I hear Rainbow Dash is a big favorite. So colorful! I love that the series seems to have given them all such in-depth personalities.
4172,It is such a great show! I agree that it's nice they are all so distinct and unique. Pinkie Pie is probably my least favorite though.
4172,Oh yeah? Why is she your least favorite?
4172,She has all of those pink spots all over her and she isn't as pretty others. They are way more unique. Do you have a favorite pony?
4172,"The white and purple one, Rarity? I just love her color scheme and the look of her mane and tail!"
4172,OMG Rarity is definitely like one of the prettiest ponies! I love her too! I love the symbols on the ponies too.
4172,I love how each symbol is special to the pony that has it.
4172,Foreal! And the fact that they have transformed at times is so cool!
4172,You mean when they turned into humans? That was really cool. It must have been a fun challenge to translate the pony designs into human designs.
4172,That was pretty crazy! I was so shocked to see that and how they looked!
4173,yeah he is my rock
4173,"It's just a weekend, I am sure you will be fine."
4173, i feel he will cheat on me
4173,I think you should have more trust in someone you refer to as your rock.
4173,i do. 
4173,"See , there is nothing to worry about.  What our your plans for the weekend?"
4173,hanging with family
4173,That sounds great. I love family time.  What family exactly?
4173,my sisters
4173,Great.  What do you guys do? Going to a movie would be fun.
4173,yeah it would.
4173,It seems like most of the movies anymore are super hero movies. Do you like them?
4173,yeah
4174,What kind of dog? I work on a farm as a farm hand and there are a lot of dogs there
4174,he is a border collie named robbie
4174,Very cute. Collies are a great do and Robbie is a nice name. I would get a Lab if I could
4174,he goes everywhere with me. why cant you have a lab?
4174,Right now I don't have enough space. it'd be mean in such a small apartment
4174,"understandable, when i lived in an apartment i felt them same. and the pet deposits were so expensive"
4174,Agreed. Hopefully in the next year or two I will move out and can get one. Have you had other pets?
4174,i used to have a cat when i lived with my mom but she ran awhile away ago.
4174,I am sorry to hear that. It's always tough hearing stories like that
4174,she was a wild one. a black feisty cat but i still ocassionally spot her when im visiting home.
4174,"Oh okay, well that isn't as bad. I was thinking it was an indoor cat that escaped"
4174,well she was indoor but very wild and always got free til she decided to not come back inside
4174,Makes sense. Sounds like she can take care of herself then out there
4175,"As a cartographer, I let my maps speak louder than my words."
4175,what is a cartographer do?
4175,We draw the maps that you find in atlases and online.
4175,"wow , i have never met a cartographer before . do you enjoy it ?"
4175,It comes naturally because I enjoy painting outdoors. You?
4175,i work in an office
4175,"The office probably pays better, but I like the forest."
4175,It sounds like a peacefull job
4175,I enjoy it. It helps an old guy like me stay in shape.
4175, i am sure you are in good shape
4175,I do my best lol
4175, i like to play video games
4176,"i also like the movement on the river,the galloping movement i mean."
4176,Ha! So many of the paddling-on-the-water past times are like that. What else do you like aside from kayaking?
4176,"i like football a lot. I like football in different forms. Video game ,physical football, fantasy football etc "
4176,I'm part of the Philadelphia Eagles! 
4176,"oh really, cool. what we call football here is what you call soccer. I am actually referring to soccer."
4176,I see. Who's your favorite team?
4176,I support Arsenal football Club of London. Who is the star player of the Philadelphia eagle?
4176,It's Carson Wentz for me. The guy's dedication is unbelievable. Do you bet on your favorite team?
4176,"I rarely bet on my team, the team has not been consistent with their performance recently. its not encouraging"
4176,That makes sense. I also won't bet on my favorite team if they're not likely to win. 
4176,That's the right thing to do. How is the Philadelphia Eagles doing recently?
4176,We're doing alright but could get better. We just need to pushing ourselves. 
4176,Great. i heard some great things about Philadelphia city itself. i heard it's a great city
4177,"that is right, they are so wonderful to be taught"
4177,"They are, I love working with children too!"
4177,"what is your name, my name is Sarah"
4177,Hi Sarah. I'm Matt
4177,Do you also work with children too?
4177,I do. My son is 8 and I coach his soccer & baseball teams
4177,It must mean you are good with sports. Is that what you teach?
4177,"Yes I grew up playing sports, so it's fun to pass that along to my son. Did you ever play sports?"
4177,When I was young I had knee injury so I can not play sports anymore only occasionally that doesn't require too much movement. What sports are you best at?
4177,I am sorry to hear that. Hopefully it is better now. I am best at soccer and golf
4177,"I have never played golf before, does it take a long time to get good at aiming and getting the ball into the holes?"
4177,Yes it does. It took me 5-7 years to get pretty good at it
4178,I'm not sure.
4178, i thought it was a real place too
4178,I also love cooking how about you?
4178," i am a terrible cook, the worst"
4178,"I've been binge watching Hells Kitchen.  It's a good show, I like"
4178,It is the best show ever made ever in life ever lol
4178,"Gordon Ramsay is funny.  I know some people don't like him, but I get a kick out it.  Hey, do you do any sports?"
4178,"no, couch potato, I love Nascar though."
4178,I love to swim.  Won a few comptetions when I was in school. Who is your favorite driver?

4179,I walk my dog as well. He is very friendly.

4179,I have a German shepherd named Benjimine.
4179,Benjimine--is that a French name? I have never seen that spelling.
4179,"Yes, Its a French name. Its pronounced a bit different to Benjamin."
4179,My grandson's name is Ben. He likes chocolate cake.
4179,My grandpas name was also Ben. He used to love to talk.
4179,My grandad lived to talk too. He used to talk about old times.
4179,I think I inherited my bubbly character from my grandad.
4179,I think I inherited my independent spirit from mine. He was a hardworking man though.
4180,"Yes. I'm waiting on a few, actually. I'm so excited, but I don't have anyone to talk to about it."
4180,I'm glad you have some exciting mailing on the way! Who are you expecting them from?
4180,I bought a bunch of stuff from Amazon. They have so much selection!
4180,"Ohh that's really exciting. I love how fast they ship so many things, Amazon will be so useful when my child is born. What stuff did you buy?"
4181,Not really.  I do occasionally enjoy getting out and taking photos

4181,"What a dream come true! If you don't mind my asking, what career are you retiring form?"
4181,I am a software engineer and I have been doing that for 25 years.  
4181,"Oh I see, well congratulations! You must be very excited!"

4182,too cool. i've got pink hair to complete the look! how long you been playing?

4183,"Yes it is, they have each other and are not lonely"
4184,"Yeah, you can call it art. its beautiful and tasking at the same time"
4184,Indeed. I like to play strategy and role-playing games. What kind of video games do you like?
4184,I play a lot of soccer games both Fifa and PES. i find it more intriguing playing opponents and winning them.
4184,"That's cool! The latest versions of FIFA soccer video games include exclusively-licensed leagues and teams from all over the globe, makes it extra exciting to play."
4184,"Yeah, thats one of the benefits of playing Fifa, they have proper licensing for the content unlike PES which is partially licensed."

4184,"Cool, i love ""Mood Forever"" especially from the last album. "
4184,That's great. So many popular songs but I always get back to what I've always loved.
4185,Good. My parents had the same philosophy as you
4185,i've always taught myself to eat organic food only .
4185,I agree. The most important things in life are taking care of your health and family
4185,"i agree and sometimes they're taken for granted. However that being said, before I start organic food my favorite food was pizza"
4185,Pizza can be organic as well. I really like experimenting with organic recipes and having fun in the kitchen
4185,That is great a lot of countries and people are practicing organic foods and it is increased interest a lot. How long have you been experimenting with organic recipes?
4185,"My entire life pretty much. My parents, like you, always wanted to live a moral and healthy life while having fun at the same time"
4185,I am still in high school and I am hoping in the future persuade them to eat like me and think like me it takes time
4185,It's good you're trying to teach your parents. You really don't appreciate them until they're gone
4185,"That is so true, do you have children?"
4185,"Yes I do. They're my everything, so I try my best to give them everything while i still can"
4185,"You sound like a great parent, they're lucky to have you! How many do you have?"
4186,My girl friend also lives in a condo.
4186,Do you like dogs? I think they are very reliable partners.
4186,I prefer cats. They are so cute. 
4186,"Cat's are fun too, but I find that dogs are more in tune with human behavior. Dogs can also be trained well."
4186,"Yes, Cats cannot be trained to do tricks. "
4186,What kind of tricks can you do? Anything out of the ordinary?
4186,I can do a flip.
4186,"oh wow , I could not do that as a kid and still not today"
4186,What kinds of stunts can you do?
4186,I can shoot a target with my eyes closed.
4186,"Wow, I tried that at a party and ended up hitting a ballon. Everyone jumped."
4186,"Ha, that sounds comical."
4187,"That is funny, good luck with that."
4187,Thanks! One day....
4187,"I am sure it will happen for you, i would like not to work so hard."
4187,Do you do any stock trading? Its not hard.
4187,I recently looked at bitcoin and forex but i have not jumped in yet. Have you had any luck?
4187,"I have done a lil bit of bitcoin, but no forex. Seems easy though."
4187,If it works it would be the perfect get rich quick. 
4187,Yep. Wonder how you know when to sell?
4187,"Im not sure, but im sure if it increases thats a good sign"
4187,Yeah that is when you make money.
4187,"yes good luck with it, i will take a second look and try it."
4187,Thanks! Good luck to you as well.
4188,haha. they are important to me though
4188,i can understand that lol. what's most important about them to you?
4188,they are so loyal. it's only fair i am too
4188,"you mean loyal to you or themselves? you don't have to feel bad about not obeying, you can blame it on someone if you're caught"
4188,"both, really. i just don't like to break the rules."
4188,i see. who makes the rules in the first place though and what if rules conflict?
4188,"i mean, they both do. i just abide by them. "
4188,won't you have to have some rules of your own at somepoint in the future?
4188,"i guess i will. i haven't thought much about it, though. i guess i should."
4188,yeah i mean you get to make the rules you want to live by and those can be rules that you want.
4188,i guess i should think about those in the future. structure is important.
4188,yea i think that sounds like a good plan. you can find out what you enjoy and what you think is right and still have structure
4189,i was so embarassed.  I wish my family had seen it and told me.  
4189,"Oh no, that must have been terrible"
4189,"yeah. it was at a kids sports game so not exactly pg, lol.  this is why I prefer a good book to sports."
4189,"That has never happened to me, i really dont wear dresses"
4189,what's your favorite outfit?
4189,"jeans and a nice sweater, you?"
4189,yoga pants and a long sweater. lounge on the couch with a good book and hot tea or coffee! especially in the fall.
4189,"I love the fall weather,love to cook a nice soup and veg"
4189,just ate some broccoli cheese soup with a baguette for dinner. small world!
4189,I love beer cheese soup the best
4189,oooh that is good. do you ever make it from scratch? have a good recipe?
4189," i love to cook and usually improvise,the beer needs to be dark and any 2 cheeses you like"
4189,sounds good with some home made bread. i use oatmeal to make a nice loaf in the bread machine.
4190,I am too! I had been stuck in the rain for hours!
4190,Did you get wet or where you able to avoid the rain?
4190,"Well I was able to avoid it most of the time, but I had to get out to check the tires and couldn't find an umbrella."
4190,So what happened that you ended up on the side of the rode?
4190,A truck I was driving behind hit a pot hole and a box of nails fell off and I ran right over them?
4190,Wow that is terrible to hear I hope you're ok!
4190,"I am now, mostly thankful that officer arrived. Thanks for picking up my slack of work"
4190,A good officer is always good to hear about.  Sounds like a solid member of the force.
4190,I agree! He was so accomadating as well
4190,I bet he has some crazy stories he tells his friends on the force and his family at home.
4190,"I bet, he told me he used to patrol the late night/early morning shift. Who knows what he has seen!"
4190,Indeed.  I hope he stays safe when he's on duty.
4191,"Oh, mine too! Now that the apples are ripe, it's pie making time!!!"
4191,nothing like waking up from a nice nap to the smell of a nice apple pie !
4191,"Yup, I just love baking pies. There's just something about making them from scratch..."
4191,I agree. I am hoping that I will have time since I started taking a weekend class
4191,Oh! What class are you taking?
4191,Krav maga - it is a type of self defense/workout class
4191,"Oh, wow! I've heard about that. It's Israeli, isn't it?"
4191,Yes.  It was developed by their military.  I think it is interesting
4191,"It's very interesting. Very aggressive, too!"
4191,Yeah.  I am more interested in self defense and just enjoy the workout in the gym
4191,I wish I could get to the gym more often.
4191,It is hard to find time. I try and go 3 times a week - me time
4192,Maybe I should get a tattoo as well
4192,I got a thorns one on my toes and it looked really cool
4192,That costs a lot of money though. I do not have enough funds
4192,Well you could be like me and get a job as a dental hygienist but the only problem is that i hate seeing others saliva
4192,"I plan to go to college after high school, but I don't think dentistry is for me. I am also grossed out about saliva"
4192,well what do you enjoy then?
4192,"I enjoy painting and art, but my parents tell me I won't make money with that kind of profession."
4192,well art is very fun but usually it is quite hard to sell things like paintings
4192,"That is true, but there are other kinds of art such as digital design which seems to be more popular"
4192,I agree. The market for digital design is on the rise
4192,Do you regret choosing Dentistry
4192,"Not really, you get to meet new people all the time and give them advice that will help their lives."
4193,Variety is good. What kind of restaurants?
4193,"It really varies, but most times we get Italian. I love pasta especially."
4193,That's cool. I found my first geocache outside an Italian restaurant.
4193,"Wow, that's interesting. What did you find inside it?"
4193,Sheet music. It's what made me take up piano.
4193,The piano is cool. Have you heard of pianist Bruce Hornsby?
4193,"Hornsby is good, he has the same birthday as my Uncle Jurt"
4193,Nice. I share the same birthday as Robert De Niro. Maybe that's why I like Italian food so much.
4193,Robert De Niro is like your power animal. Mine is Howard the Duck.
4194,"No, just that once. Do you have siblings?"
4194,"Yes, i have two sisters, one brother and loads of cousins. it was awesome growing up with them."
4194,Siblings are great. Now that I have children I am realizing just how much work they are though.
4194,"They really are, they are the first friends are i know."
4194,That is amazing.
4194,"Yes it is, growing up with my siblings and cousins gave me the chance to know them properly and to get close to them."
4194,Did you grow up eating lollipops in your family?
4194,"Yes, we loved lollipops as kids. do you? "
4194,Yes! I love lollipops as well. And rainbows! haha
4194,"i love rainbows too, your childhood must be quite interesting. where did you grow up?"
4194,I grew up in Maine. Where did you grow up?
4194,"I grew up in London, what state is Maine located?"
4195,I can play only basic songs on the piano. Maybe one day I can become better. What instrument do you play?
4195,i dont play anything well. took violin lessons in elementary school
4195,I tried learning how to play violin and I'm just not good at it. I gave up. I'm busy these days working anyway.

4195,What kind of books do you like? I'm not into it. 
4195,I like to read autobiogrophys
4195,I see. How often do you read? I work as a nurse in ER so I get so busy to have time to do other stuff.
4195,I am a nurse too. i like to read on my lunch break
4195,"That's a good way to pass time. When I'm off, I try to chill by playing the piano even just a few songs.,"
4195, i like to curl up with my cat george after work
4195,Sounds sweet. Pets can be therapeutic after a busy day.
4195, i love cats alot and i also like parrots
4196,That's the truth! What would you do if you were rich?
4196,if i was rich i would do a lot of charities
4196,"Well that is noble of you, but what would you do for you?"
4196,buy a car and help family out . 
4196,Nice. I think I would invest. Passive income you know!
4196,oh indeed a passive income would be nice. small business for sure . 
4196,Would be nice to work while traveling I think.
4196,oh there is nothing better then traveling and getting passive income at the same time for sure. 
4196,#goals
4196,my goals in life is to be successful . healthy and and make money while doing it. 
4196,same. we should team up lol
4196,Good idea!
4197,Maybe the guy was in shock?
4197,"It could have been shock, yeah, but who knows?  Was it your daily commute train you saw him on?"
4197,"No, just going up town to meet some friends. I offered the guy on the train a tissue but he just looked right through me, strange."
4197,"Man, that's strange.  You think he was on drugs or something?"
4197,"Maybe, one of the passengers called 911."
4197,Probably best.  I called for help once and got put on hold!
4197,"Lol, how long did you have to wait?"
4197,"Too long!  The only good thing about that call was the hold music from my fave band, Red Hot Chili Peppers, lol."
4197,"Maybe it should have been the song ""Time is on my side""."
4197,"rofl, for sure.  I'll never forget that day, it was so cold--I love cold weather, but this was too cold."
4197,"Change the song to ""Baby it's cold outside""."
4197,"lol you're funny.  I think the song should have just been ""HELP!"""
4198,I like how his voice reverbs off of my bug jars.
4198," i love garth brooks, he is cute. i would like to see him in concert'"
4198,I hear he puts on a good show.
4198,he came here but i was sick and missed it
4198,"When I ran for governor in 2004, he let us use a song"
4198,did you win?
4198,"No, I didn't have the advertising money some others did unfortunately."
4198,that is a shame
4198,"It's ok, life goes on."
4198,what do you do in your free time?
4198,I collect bugs. Jars of them.
4198, i love dragonflys
4199,"Math is my favorite subject, but some concepts are hard to grasp"
4199,"Mathematics has been quite a big phenomenon recently, but of course some students will always have a hard time grasping some concepts"
4199,"My little sister is 5 years younger than me, so I help her out with the easier math classes"
4199,That sounds very cool. I sometimes have trouble understanding math so i just decided to become a stand up comedian
4199,Nice! Do you have a large audience?
4199,"No not really, I do it in my small town"
4199,How is the reaction from the audience usually like?
4199,"Well I just have some small conversations with them and crack a couple of jokes, Of course some like it more than others"
4199,Did you train yourself or did you take classes?
4199,"I took some classes from a distant education, they always taught me to be formal in big crowds. But I ended up staying quite informal in the end."
4199,Informal is the best when it comes to comedy. People like to laugh along with topics they personally relate to
4199,"Yes, they are most happy when you relate to them. By the way, do you want to become a comedian in the future as well?"
4199,"I am not a comedic person, probably should work harder in my math classes."
4200,what language are you learning?
4200,Right now I am learning Japanese. Very different than English!
4200,"that sounds way harder than english. i don't think i would be able to learn a new language, its a lot of work. how long have you been learning it?"
4200,It is much harder and a lot of work. But also very fun and rewarding. It's been roughly about a year or more now. 
4200,wow youve been working on it for quite a while. have you been able to find anyone that speaks japanese that you can practice with ?
4200,No I haven't yet. But I'm able to practice a good bit online too. 
4200,thats cool. are you planning on going to japan at some point?
4200,"Yes, I can't wait to go. But I would want to have more experience with their language first. "
4200,that will be fun i bet. yeah im sure it would take a lot of experience to talk to people over there.
4200,I think it will. But I think people are understanding when you can see that it's not someones first language. 
4200,i think people definitely respect someone who puts in the work to learn something. ive heard japan has a very different culture compared to america.
4200,Hopefully you've heard good things about Japan!
4200,yeah i have heard it has very nice mountains.
4201,She really enjoyed it. It's a dish my grandma taught me. Do you enjoy cooking?
4201,Yes.  My friends and I have a potluck dinner every Sunday - so fun
4201,That sounds nice! I wish I had more friends who cooked
4201,It is a nice way to get together - nothing fancy is required.  
4201,I have my  friends over once a week for dinner. Most of the time I do all the cooking. The time together is always very nice
4201,Do you all play games or watch movies or just enjoy the company of each other
4201,"/Depends on the way we feel. Sometimes we just chat about our week, other times we pull out the karaoke machine and everything in between! how about you gus"
4201,"Love the karoke idea - sounds fun.  We play games - cards, jenga, cattan, etc"
4201,Admittedly that came about on accident when my daughter gt a karaoke machine for Christmas. It's great fun!
4201,I don't have kids.  How many do you have?
4201,I have two daughters. Any pets?

4203,Do you compost your leftover food?
4203,"No, I do not compost my food but I should. I have not thought of that"
4203,It is great for the environment.
4203,How is composting your waste helpful for the environment? 
4203,"It creates amazing fertilizer to help people grow their own food, which lowers packaging waste."
4204,I remember growing up I ate PB&Js for lunch every day at school until I graduated
4204,I don't believe you. I used to eat them all the time as a kid
4204,"I did! That was the only thing I liked, besides chicken nuggets and pizza of course."
4204,"The chicken nuggets are good! I like that they serve healthy options now too, such as salads and smoothies"
4204,"I'm sorry, I am a bit confused. Where are you talking about?"
4204,i love chicken nuggs
4204,"Oh okay, I still love them. What type of sauce do you like with your nuggs?"

4206,"That's interesting , i prefer to play on the PlayStation system. i have a PS4 console. whats your favorite game"

4206,"My favorite is Fifa, i like soccer a lot,i play God of war too."
4206,Soccer is such a competitive sport. I never really played the games but I'd like to try them. Ever played NFL Madden Football?
4206,"You should try playing soccer sometimes. No, i haven't played NFL Madden,how is it though?"
4206,It's pretty fun. I have a friend who plays it competitively and is top 100 in the world.
4206,"Wow, that's awesome. She must be very good at it then."
4206,Yeah she really is. I haven't once been able to beat her at that game. Do you watch real soccer by any chance or just play the games?
4206,"i watch real soccer, i have been to the Emirate stadium to watch Arsenal football team played couple of times. i play physically too. what about you?"
4206,Wow. That's amazing. I played football in high school and college at the running back position.
4206,"oh ok, what does the running back do? "
4207,I'll tell you what I don't like. Green eggs and ham.
4207,"One of my fave books growing up!  But I hate eggs now, lol"
4207,The green ones are usually rotten.
4207,"And smelly, lol.  I can only hope that my writing career is as well-known and profitable as Dr. Seuss!!"
4207,The world always needs writers. Do you like dogs?
4207,"Yes, I have six dogs.  All shelties and I love them all!"
4207,"Very nice, I have four myself."
4207,Really?  Aren't they the best?  Maybe I should write about them!
4207,Always a good source of inspiration. The world to a dog.
4207,"Oh, yeah.  So, what's your career?  And do you love it?"
4207,I work in a gorcery. It's ok.
4207,My first job was at a grocery store.  Wound up hating it.  
4208,when i used to have a dog he used to help me excersise when we went for a run
4208,"That's nice! Dogs are really active, so they are good exercise partners"
4208,what other breeds would you recommend to me
4208,"I personally prefer smaller dogs, like the corgi"
4208,"yeah, but would such small breeds serve well as excersising partners?"
4208,"They have small legs, but nonetheless are very active breeds in my opinion"
4208,Anyway i am planning to adopt a dog in the next few weeks
4208,it is always better to adopt rather than purchase .
4208,"Yeah, I agree. The problem is shelters are sometimes too demanding in their condtions"
4208,"True, but I still think that shelter dogs end up being really loving pets. It is worth the hassle"
4208,I agree it is worth the hassle.
4209,i have  3 dogs
4209,What kind of dogs do you have
4209,i have a palmeraineon ridge back and a poodle .

4211,yea it was time to step up. I've been feeling better ever since
4211,"that is so awesome , never give up , keep pushing"
4211,I got to reconnect with my daughters and now once a month i try ti take them shopping
4211,"oh wow , good for you ! that's admirable stay present time fly's "
4211,Excactly! I was so caught up in my work and being obsessed with re modeling houses that i didn't spend any time with my daughters
4211,hey it's good to reflect on self from time to time
4211,How do you balance your work life?
4211,"single , people around here are very childish so i tend to separate myself from the ignorance and focus more on my task"
4211,"Oh nice,thats a good way to do it!"
4211,"yea finding a good balance between work and living a healthy life, too much of either is unhealthy"
4211,"I agree,thats why now i feel like i am on the right path of achieving that balance!"
4211,"yes , well start small , and then go big your going to do great !"
4212,how was that ??
4212,what happened that made the date a disaster?
4212,i showed up late and sweaty . lol 
4212,"Oh, well I am sure the date was just happy you were there!"
4212,yah after a little mingle it was great after that . 
4213,I can smell it on his clothes when I do laundry
4213,"That's also sad, it will affect your level of trust for him. He may be really trying to stop, have you thought of that?"
4213,"We do not talk as much nowadays, it might be due to my job, which requires me to drive long distances"
4213,what type of job is that?
4213,"Truck driving. I am barely home, but I need to pay my bills"
4213,"That will actually require you to travel a lot,whats the farthest you have driving?"
4213,"Sometimes I am required to cross the state border, which means I am away from home days at a time"
4213,"I think you need to have a serious conversation with your husband on his drinking habit, especially since he'll be with the kids more."
4213,"That is true, even though my children are in high school now, it is not a good image for them to see their father drunk all the time"
4213,"No, its not at all. how many kids do you have?"
4213,"I have 2 sons. On good days, they go out hunting with my husband"
4213,"Oh,so you are both hunters? what does your husband do for a living?"
4214,"I guess that is true. I just wish there was more connection with customers, something more personal"
4214,"Yeah, that's what consumers are losing today, the personal touch.  Maybe we can hire more associates to field calls."
4214,"That would be a start, maybe even a video call for customer service needs."
4214,What a great idea!  I think that might go over really well.  I'll suggest that next staff meeting
4214,"Thanks! If I could just receive graditute from someone I have helped, I would enjoy my days so much more!"
4214,"Well, I'd certainly let you know how the idea goes over.  You'll have my gratitude, and maybe something from Amazon.  Who knows?"
4214,Maybe a promotion or a bonus? It couldn't come at a better time!
4214,"That would be so great!  And it would help the customers a lot, seeing a real person."
4214,My thoughts exactly. I always feel like I'm not even talking to a person when I call a company's customer service.
4214,"Yeah, as much as I love robotics, I HATE talking to an automated, robotic voice on the phone."
4214,"I don't hate it, I just always have additional questions because I am such an overthinker. I need to be positive I understand."
4214,"Yes, same.  I also write down everything and try to get a session number, in case I need it later."
4215,I work for Toyota manufacturing. It is hard work but I enjoy working with cars. What about you?
4215,I am a university student currently on a hockey scholarship. What is your favorite model of Toyota
4215,I like them all but the 4-Runner is my favorite
4215,That's a great choice. They look really nice and safe. What do you do for fun?
4215,I enjoy going to car shows and volunteering at election polls. I like to keep up with politics. What about yourself>
4215,"my family gets into politics a lot, but fortunately it rarely turns hostile."
4215,That's lucky! A lot of times people don't take different political opinions well. 
4215,it doesn't sound like it . how are you with politics ?
4215,I just like to be informed but I respect other people who feel differently than I do
4215,It is good to stay informed.
4215,It helps keep the peace!
4215,What was your favorite subject in school? Government? I love math
4216,Just an ex wife of mine. She was something else let me tell you. 
4216,"Oh goodness, you will find someone better. "
4216,I sure hope so. Next time I won't let my dog introduce us!
4216,Oh you have a dog! What breed?
4216,He is a mutt from the pound. Rescued him 10 years ago. Some kind of lab mix. 
4216,Awww that's really sweet. I like dogs more than people.
4216,Most days I do too!
4216,Do you have anymore animal friends?
4216,Just the one dog. He has plenty of love for me. Not sure I'm ready for another one just yet.
4216,I'm really glad you and your do are getting along well. Dogs are mans best friend after all! 
4216,If only he could reach things up high for me. i'm simply too short!
4216,"Yeah, same. Im pretty short myself."
4217,i agree 
4217,Do you not like shopping?
4217,i love shopping . 
4217,Same! Although I do not brag to my friends about the things I buy.
4217,same here no need to brag. 
4217,"I live in a small town, so most of the shops around me are not expensive name brands."
4217,i live in a small town my self and sometimes i will come into name brand stuff. 
4217,Are they authentic though? Some places sell look-a-likes.
4217,well not really sure how authentic they are but that is a good question .
4217,"At the end of they day, what matters is if you feel comfortable with what you wear"
4217,i so agree to what you are saying . 
4217,The clothing shown on fashion shows are not even seen in daily life. High fashion is only for the rich
4218,Oh nice....talking about being vegan is my favorite
4218,I can't give up cheese!! I've tried the vegan cheeses and not enough flavor.
4218,Yeah cheese was a hard one to give up 
4218,I imagine I'd lose a bit of weight if I made the switch
4218,"Yes, I'm a nurse and I've encountered many patients who lost weight when they made to switch to vegan"
4218,It could also go the opposite if you eat the wrong foods. What type of nurse are you?
4219,My parents are divorced and it really rocked my world as a kid
4219,"I'm sorry to hear that. It is a hard thing for children to go through that. If you don't mind me asking, why did they separate?"
4219,My dad had an affair with his secretary :(
4219,That's horrible. I have never been married but my girlfriend was having an affair with a friend of mine. It's rough sometimes huh?
4219,I am so sorry to hear that! What did your friend say for himself?
4219,They left without a word. But I'm doing much better now. I hope you are as well after going through that as a kid.
4219,I am doing better now. I'm nearly thirty but some worry about the past comes into my own marriage. Sorry to get deep
4219,It's fine. Just stay strong and you'll get through it. These things all take time you know? 
4219,For sure. I love working with animals. Do you have any pets
4219,I own a cat. He's so curious too. I was playing chess with a friend and he just hops up on the table.
4219,You could have the first chess playing cat!
4219,Haha! That would be amazing to see. What's your favorite animal?
4220,I am doing well. Yes we did get the house repaired. Thanks for your concern.
4220,"I know something about homes renovations, I can give you some tips if you want"
4220,"Sure, I'l be glad to take in a few tips for future references."
4220,You are more than welcome :)
4220,Thanks dear.
4220,was to expensive your reparation after the all was do it?
4220,Please futher explain.
4220,was to expensive the reparation after the huracane?
4220,Yes indeed but we managed to get thorugh with everythig in the process.
4220,Where did you move to after the hurricane?
4220,We didn't move but temporarily stayed with a relative until we rennovated the home.
4220,"nice, alwas it's good have people to get help, where I live we not have huracanes frequently"
4221,"For sure, I wouldn't know what to do without them. Are you close to your family?"
4221,i like to think so . but i only have a few close ones .
4221,"Glad to hear it, even one close person in your life makes a world of difference. My father in law actually taught me to sew. Doing it ever since!"
4221,that is truly a gift of frugality . i wish i could sew .
4221,"It's a lot of fun, and of course useful. Making some costumes for friends this Halloween, and baking some cookies! How is your weekend going?"
4221,I will be playing video games with my husband. what are you going to be this Halloween?
4221,"We're going to have a small get together, dress up, and watch scary movies... Bad ones, for a laugh, heh. What games do you two play?"
4221,"We play Evil within, resident evil, last of us, and silent hill. Do you play video games?"
4221,I've seen some of those played. I mostly like to watch. Haven't played one seriously since Space Invaders in the arcade!
4221,nice! i like the old arcade games from the 1980s like pacman.
4221,"Oh yeah, that's a good one too. I played the heck out of a Mrs Pacman machine at the laundry mat around that time, heh."
4221,"Nice! In fact, there's a rock band based out of Denver that is called "
4222,"They had a god run, have you ever seen one in person?"
4222,I do. I drive a restored 1973 Mustang. It used to be my father's. 
4222,Oh I bet you love it! My twin brother and I spent years restoring out grandfathers '69 Mustang. 
4222,"That's awesome. They're very fun to drive, and definitely a conversation starter."
4222,"Yes, you can't take it anywhere without at least one person saying something about it to you."
4222,"I agree. My father's a doctor, so I own multiple cars. But the Mustang is my favorite."
4222,"Its a classic, what kind of doctor is he? "
4222,He's a plastic surgeon. He even did a few procedures on my me.
4222,"If you don't mind my asking, what kind of procedures have you had done?"
4222,"Well, I've had a rhinoplasty and a hair transplant. The best part is I get a family discount."
4222,"Oh, he did not do it for free?"
4222,"I wish. He's a bit cheap that way. But considering how I looked before, I was lucky I even got a discount to begin with."
4223,football injury 
4223,Ouch that must have hurt! Is he doing better now?
4223,well no he is in a coma from the injury . 
4223,"Oh wow am so sorry, I hope he recovers fast!"
4223,they said he will over time . 
4223,Thats good to hear! A fellow biker friend of mine was also in a coma after he got in an accident and he recovered fast
4223,amen on that fast recovery is always great . 
4223,yes just keep your head high and pray everyday!
4223,not a day goes by i dont pray thank u so much for your support and caring. 
4223,"Of course we have to help each other however we can,the strength remains in the prayer!"
4223,amen on that . 
4223,Take care of yourself and good luck to both of you!
4223,ty so much for your support . 
4224,"I do try, but it's difficult because I travel a lot. "
4224,I hear that. I wish I could travel more.
4224,"I once traveled around the world in a boat! Too much seafood for me, haha. Do you like to eat seafood?"
4224,"It's pretty good, yeah. I like to have variety in my meals so I wouldn't want to eat it all the time though."
4224,I totally understand needing variety. Did you normally cook your meals or eat outside your home?
4224,My roommate and I take turns cooking. I think she's better than I am though.
4224,Oh wow you are luck. A good roommate is hard to find.
4224,"Yeah. She's a bit clingy though, always bugging me when I'm playing war games on the computer."
4224,"That sounds annoying, sorry to hear that. Do you often play computer games?"
4224,"Yeah. It's pretty great, I get to command armies and everything."
4224,I like those type of games as well. I enjoy a game called Tropico where I get to rule an island.
4224,"Oh that sounds awesome, I'll have to check it out."
4225,I think my love for mortal kombat is what pushed me to take krav maga.
4225,thats legit! i love mma and jiu jitsu 
4225,"Yea it's such an intense sport, very technical and "
4225,I've never tried it but I bet it is. Do you stick to a certain diet?
4225,"usually lean meats like chicken and veggies. Nothing unique, workouts are the more important part."
4225,Do you have to give up carbs? Pretzels are my favorite i don't think i could give them up 
4225,"Yea sadly you can't really dip into carbs, they offer very little."
4225,Oh man! That would be difficult. I get a good workout from my job with our local railroad
4225,Oh thats an interesting job title.
4225,It's a very difficult but interesting job. What do you do?
4226,"Oh yes, it was a pleasant surprise. They have themed it around my favorite color - green"
4226,"Neat, that sounds like a good idea! Will they be cooking your favorite meal? I love to cook, so I have to ask, heh"
4226,"Nice match, I love to eat. ha ha.. My mom had made my favorite dish - vegi-meatballs in her special tomato sauce"
4226,"That sounds so good! My boys love Italian food. I'm always making it after their soccer games, and for the team every once in a while."
4227,"I don't have much of a career right now, so I can't really afford it."
4227,if you like the plumbing you should try to do some work by your self and safe money
4227,"I would, but I'm afraid of making the problem worse."
4227,you can use youtube videos to learn how to do it by your self
4227,I could try. Have you ever had to fix anything by yourself?
4227,"yes, all the time, I prefer spend time on youtube watching the videos instead got a huge bill after the service"
4227,Very smart! I'll have to look into it.
4227,some time the more spensive thing it's buy the tool but nothing comparative whit the amount of the bill
4227,"Yeah, but I should have the tools to fix a sink already."
4227,"for that problem the supply and the tools are not expensive at all, maybe with less than 60 usd you fix the problem"
4227,I'm hoping to not have to spend anything at all.
4227,"sure, then you can take my advice about do it by your self..lol"
4228,Well those neighbors have ten puppies that need help. I'm not sure what to do.
4228,"My dear, what happened? Hopefully you can take care of them."
4228,"They don't seem to feed them, they appear malnourished and they've had complaints from other neighbors."
4228,Has animal control been called? they could make a visit and check things out perhaps. 
4228,I think someone called them yesterday thankfully. I have heard they are hoarders and that might be why they have so many puppies.
4228,Keep an eye on the situation and call the police if necessary!
4228,"Thanks, I will keep an eye on them, hoping the animal control shows up tomorrow."
4228,I wouldn't be surprised if they took all the animals to the local shelter. Sounds like a better life for them to me. 
4228,"I agree, hopefully they get the hoarders some help too, otherwise they might keep doing this."
4228,Fixing the root problem of the hoarders could really go a long way to help everyone involved.
4228,Yeah it's just not good for anyone involved.
4228,Sounds like maybe it was a puppy mill. I would consider a rescue dog if I was to get one.
4229,I don't know if I have time to finish the project now. Ideas?
4229,I could get some of my friends together and see if they could help. They're nice girls. 
4229,That'd be amazing! It's due in an hour and a half.
4229,Oh no! I have volleyball practice in fifteen minutes. Some of the friends are on the team. Should I ask the whole team?
4229,Would that be okay? I need to pass this class to finish up my doctorate.
4229,"Absolutely! They're always willing to help out, I'll organize a meeting with them since I'm the coach. Just meet up with us in the gym!"
4229,"Alright! In exchange, I'll take you all of one of my next hiking trips. The mountains are my happy place."
4229,"sounds amazing! I love mountains, great for exercise!"
4229,"For sure! I know all the good spots with the best views, too."
4229,I'm sure the team will love it. What will we bring as snacks?
4229,Whatever you want! I'm more than happy to provide after all you've helped me with.
4229,"Just don't bring any apples, you know I can't resist even though I should! "
4230,I think financially and a family unit.
4230,Those are good goals. I'm currently studying English. Did you go to college?
4230,That sounds great. I did not but wish I had.
4230,I'm torn on if this was a good decision. If all goes well though I hope to teach at my college 
4230,Have you always wanted to teach?
4230,Yes as long as I can remember it is what I've wanted to do
4230,I thought about teaching music at one point. I love all styles. It is great you are following your dreams
4230,The best teachers are passionate. Do you enjoy your career?
4230,Not really. I consider it a job as opposed to a career. It pays the bills but I have no passion for it.
4230,yes I know that feeling I do not enjoy my current job. hoping for better after graduation 
4230,what is your current job?
4230,I work in a restaurant serving. They work around my school schedule
4231,I should but I can't. I t won't leave me alone.
4231,"Try teaching it your favorite poem or song, then it would be a pleasant sound."
4231,Except he can't keep a proper tune. 
4231,I would try to singalong and help him get better
4231,true. I think i will find him a tudor. I am far too busy to teach him how to sing. thank you for the idea.
4231,You are very welcome. Perhaps I could send my parakeet along for the lessons.
4231,Why not? might be a good example for my parakeet. 
4231,"That sounds great, I could bring him by on my way to the lake. I love to sit and knit at the lake."
4231,You knit? sounds like fun!
4231,"I love it, it is very relaxing."
4231,I bet. Do you ever bring your parakeet?
4231,Usually. He likes to get out of the house as well. You could try that with yours too
4231,i could try it.
4232,How are you?
4232,I'm doing quite well. I'm wondering why you chose not to tell your friends about your struggle buying your ferrari.
4232,"That is great. And well, to be honest, my friends come from high class and I didn't want to look bad."
4232,"I don't know if you should care about what your friends think that much, my friend. I'm sure you're doing way better than you think!"
4232,"I suppose so. But I guess in some ways, I don't want to be excluded. Took me longer to get where I am, than them."
4232,That makes sense-people with less struggles don't understand those with many struggles. 
4232,Correct. They had things given to them growing up and still do. My family struggled for awhile and now so have I.
4232,I'm still struggling trying to take care of my family solo-so I totally feel you.
4232,"Yes! Although, I feel like when you struggle some, you gain wisdom and appreciation even more, for what you have."
4232,I can agree with that.  What do you do to support yourself anyway?
4232,I am in finance. What about u?
4232,I am actually a dancer.  That's how I support my family. 
4233,"great, make sure the greenhouse it's in good condition before use it"
4233,That sounds like a good plan. How big is your garden?
4233,"I have no garden, my space on the front of the house it's limited"
4233,"Oh, yes I understand. I am looking to buy a new house myself, with more space."
4233,"nice, before you buy be sure about the regulation on the neightborhood, some times you cannot do too much in your front house"
4233,"Yeah! I've heard about that, thank you! So what do you like to do on your days off of work?"
4233,cooking meet on my yard and drink beer..lol...I know how to cook brazilian food 
4233,"Cool, I like that too. I've never had Brazilian food before, but would love to try it! I like to paddle board on my days off, when it's nice weather."
4233,I lived in brazil for 4 years and the beachs ar perfect to do that...you should try
4233,I have never been but I hear the beaches are pretty Do you travel ?
4233,"I like travel, ussually I travel to sopain or brazil, I have family on both countrys"
4233,That sounds nice! I have never left my country. I would like very much to visit Spain.
4234,I love my steak medium-rare. It's great with a dollop of horseradish.
4234,"Sounds good. I haven't really had a good steak, really. Horseradish sounds good right about now, though. Even getting my kids into it, heh"
4234,That's too bad. It's good you're getting your kids into horseradish though. Kids need to learn to feel the burn at a young age.
4234,"Haha, I agree! Kinda happened by accident, but they like weird food in general. What are you up to tonight?"
4234,"That's funny. I work in finance, so I just got home about an hour ago. I'm just relaxing now. What about you?"
4234,"Been home a couple hours, I work at Amazon, warehouse stuff. Just taking care of the kids mostly, have some scary movie on."
4234,"That must be exhausting taking care of kids and having a job at the same time, so it's good to unwind with a movie. Are they excited for Halloween?"
4234,"It can be hard, but school is useful to keep them busy. Used to it by now, anyway. Yeah, they're super excited. Me too, honestly, love the vibe."
4234,I love Halloween too. When I was a kid I dressed up as the grim reaper every year.
4234,"Nice! I was a very terrible grim reaper one year, but mostly random video games characters."
4234,That's cool. Are you going trick or treating with the kids this year?
4234,"Yeah, though I'm not sure I'll be dressing up, heh. The boys are REALLY into a new show lately, so I ordered some pretty cool costumes. Should be fun."
4235,How are you doing?
4235,I'm doing very well! How about yourself?
4235,"I am good. A bit under the weather, but no complaints. "
4235,"Yeah, I can understand that. As much as I enjoy nature, I have terrible allergies this time of year."
4235,"Allergies are awful at times. When I suffer from them, I tend to relax and watch older movies."
4235,I like old movies a lot. I watch a lot of Alfred Hitchcock movies. Are you in University?
4235,"Alfred Hitchcock movies are great. And no, Sterling. What about you?"
4235,"Yeah, despite failing some of my classes, ugh, I'm only a semester away from my Bachelors in Science"
4235,That is awesome. What are you planning to do with it?
4235,Biology. I love nature and animals. Do you travel?
4235,"That is so cool. I love nature too. And yes, I enjoy traveling. You?"
4235,"Yeah, I love to travel! Although, I usually go for short stays but hop around alot."
4235,"Yes, short stays are best. I like to take in as much as I can each time."
4236,I'm not a car-obsessed kind of boy. I prefer sports.
4236,"I prefer sport to, extrem sports more than everything"
4236,"Oh really? Which ones? I like hockey the best. But I'm biased, because that's what I play."
4236,"I like jumping on brigdes with a rope, and rapel too"
4236,Wow! That's amazing. Do you watch or do you participate?
4236,"I participate 100%, I like to feel adrenaline on my vens"
4236,Do you recommend it?
4236,"for sure, but go with someboddy prepared and with a safe equipment, it's a dangerous sport"
4236,I'd definitely be too scared to go by myself.
4236,you can jump with someboddy alse on the same rope if that help
4236,I'd probably do that for the first time and then go by myself the next time.
4236,"yes, you should try, I did by my self on my first time, and once a time we jump 3 guys on the same rope"
4237,"Yeah, I thought I was going to die. I was lucky to have my husband with me."
4237,"sure, a partner it's very important in that cases.Do you have survivor skills?"
4237,"Not anything more than I had seen on TV. I used to camp as a girl, too, so I suppose that helped."
4237,lol...on that escenaries the minimun info or skill helps but if you like practice outdoor sport you should be prepared
4237,What kind of outdoor sport?
4237,camping with limited supplys for example
4237,"Oh, sure. I did used to really enjoy fire building. Do you know anything about survival?"
4237,"yes, I was on the army for 2 years and I got real skills"
4237,You were? What branch?
4237,"braziliam army, not here on USA"
4237,"Oh okay, my bad! For how long?"
4237,"2 years on field, once on the trainning they left us on the middle of the amazonia forest to survive for 2 weeks"
4238,Any reason you stopped?
4238,At my age I decided traveling sounded more appealing. Have you ever done any traveling before?
4238,I do travel from time to time but I feel bad leaving my cat home alone... It can be hard to find someone to watch it.
4238,Where have you traveled to? I also have a dog and I try to find places where I am able to take him with me.
4238," I have traveled to Europe. That's kind of you, my cat would hate to leave the house I think, haha."
4238,Europe is beautiful! Where in Europe did you go? I am guessing you are right haha! What is your cats name?
4238,"England is where I went it was so nice there, but rainy. My cats name is Hazel, named after my eye color."
4238,I have heard England is so but dreary. Did you try any interesting food? I love that name - that is my eye color too! 
4238,I got to try some real authentic fish and  chips! I have one eye hazel and one blue actually. 
4238,Was it good? That is very unique! What color eyes did your parents have??
4238,It was great! Very simplistic though. My father had brown eyes and my mother blue.
4238,I will have to try them when I make it to England. How cool! I am sure that is a conversation starter.
4238,Haha sometimes people ask me if I forgot to put a contact lens in..
4239,I hurt my ankle while running and im scared to go back out
4239,Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor about it?
4239,I haven't but I should
4239,Is your ankle still painful or is it improving?
4239,"It seems to be improving, but it flairs up with a lot of walking"
4239,How long has it been?
4239,about a week
4239,I'd give it another week and then see a doctor if still remains painful.  I know a good orthopedist if you decide on seeing one. 
4239,I'd love the name!
4239,Its Dr. John Smith at Orthopedic Surgeons of NYC 
4239,Perfect. Thank you!
4239,No problem
4240,Paris is a great city to visit!
4240,Paris is indeed a wonderful place to visit.
4240,I can't get enough  of the Eiffel Tower!
4240,I really enjoyed visiting the Eiffel Tower! It's such a wonderful landmark!
4240,"It's worth the wait, because the Eiffel Tower can get so crowded. "
4240,"I agree, when I was there, there were so many people trying to get in. I'll have to plan again on a less busy day."
4240,"Good idea, weekday mid afternoons would be the best time to visit."
4240,I'll keep that in mind. My sister used to live near the Eiffel Tower and that's how I got a chance to visit it.
4240,"I see, you must have had a great time visiting your sister."
4240,Yes I did. She's been living there for ten years now and doesn't have any plans to come back.
4240,Good for her she must be used to the Paris life by now then.
4240,Yes she is. She wanted me to move there but it would be too much of a culture shock.
4241,"I am. I want to be an explorer and I'm physically fit because of my athletic career, but I'm afraid that I'm not adequately prepared."
4241,I feel ya. Hopefully you'll plan destinations that make the traveling easier. Where would you like to go?
4241,I want to go backpacking in the rocky mountains.
4241,That sounds like a blast! Have you been backpacking before?
4241,Nope! That's part of why I am so worried.
4241,I hear ya! Could you train by going backpacking on smaller trails on the weekend?
4241,That's actually a fantastic idea. Thank you! Do you know of any good places to start?
4241,Are you near any state parks that you could walk through? I know they always have great trails!
4241,I do! I'll have to start planning that soon.
4241,Good luck! I hope it goes well for you :)
4241,Thank you! I hope so too!
4241,Besides your 3 month backpacking trip do you have any other trips planned?
4242,It might have been a ghost because nothing was missing when i checked
4242,oh my gosh another ghost in my house .
4242,"Its very spooky, maybe because i live alone i get even more scared"
4242,Totally understandable. Have you ever noticed anything other times?
4242,I've heard noises before and i usually turn on music at night to help me fall asleep better
4242,"Wow, that does sound really scary then. I'm not sure I could do that haha"
4242,Yes its very helpful you should try it! Do you live alone?
4242,Nope. I live with others. No ghosts though lol
4242,Haha lucky you then!
4242,Surely! 
4242,"I am going to go skateboard now, blow off some steam. Have a great day!"
4242,"Oh, ok. Sounds interesting. Goodbye!"
4243,I don't really mind the raw part. I actually enjoy sushi quite a bit. 
4243,"You gotta try it, You should try the kind thats prepared with either brown or white rice for the best flavor. Oh and not all sushi has raw fish either."
4243,I already have tried it and I enjoy it. I've tried it at my university. 
4243,What university do you attend?
4243,I attend George Mason University. I'm studying for my masters. 
4243,what are you studying ? or are you undecided ?
4243,I'm studying chemistry 
4243,That's cool. I'm studying biochem at the moment.
4243,I wish I liked biology more. 
4243,"It seems it overlaps wiht a lot of topics though, like biochemistry, ecology, and even paleontology."
4243,Most subjects have some overlap even if they don't seem to at first. I find it interesting how statistics relates to every subject. 
4243,Indeed. Nature is very interesting and complex to interpret. Survival is the only mechanism that drive us to have certain physical features
4244,great!...what kinf of volunteer gig are you doing
4244,Providing food to the homeless at a shelter. 
4244,awesome!...I'd like to try something with kids without parents
4244,That would have to be something like a summer camp.
4244,I'm new in this country and I need to get more info about how to do that job
4244,Well I have been doing this for 8 years so I have a bit of experience. 
4244,nice!...where do you do that gig?...I mean what location
4244,Unfortunately I am not allowed to share that information. 
4244,"Oh sorry, my bad...I just wondering if you live here in usa"
4244,"Yes, I am in the USA. "
4244,great...I moved to USA 2 years ago and there is a bunch of thing that I need to learn here
4244,"I understand, is there anything else you wanted to know?"
4245,Oh how cool! Do you work for a commercial airline?
4245,Yes i work for a commercial airline!
4245,Which one?
4245,I work for Southwest.
4245,Where's your favorite place to fly?
4245,I like flying to Salt Lake City. My girlfriend lives there so every time i fly there i get to see her!
4245,How long have you been together?
4245,We have been together almost two years now!
4245,How cute! How did you meet?
4245,It was on one of my trips to Salt Lake City actually. I had a layover and met her out in the city
4245,Where are you from?
4245,I am originally from Florida. You?
4246,Great information - thank you! I love ice cream. My 2 favorite flavors are mint chip and cookie dough. What about you?
4246,My favorite is cookie dough as well. I love trying new flavors as well. 
4246,As do I! We have a local shop here in town that creates delicious flavors like blueberry pie. 
4246,I Bet! Flavorings and colors are added once the cream is made.
4246,How interesting! I like to find ice cream that doesn't have added artificial colors. That's why I try to stick to a vanilla/chocolate base.
4246,"I guess i""m a weirdo. I like the artificial flavors, they're so much more fun. "
4246,What is your favorite artificial flavor?
4246,My favorite artificial flavor is cotton candy. It doesn't even really taste like actual cotton candy. I wonder how they make it?
4246,Have you ever tried cotton candy Dip n Dots? Those are good! I'm not sure - lots of sugar!
4246,I haven't tried cotton candy Dip n Dots. Whenever I get Dip n Dots I always get mint chocolate clip. What other types of food do you like? 
4246,I just tried those yesterday! They were good. I love Italian food! What about you?
4246,I don't have italian food often. I really like to grill food myself. I own a george forman grill
4247,It's a full 2 weeks deal!
4247,a vacation sounds like a good idea to me ! Going anywhere?
4247,"Yes, on vacation, but I always think people are looking at me"
4247,Just embrace it. Own the moment if they do stare at you.
4247,"I care about the way i look when i'm in public, so I think often of it. Thanks!"
4247,Relax and be yourself! It could be worse... I'm a cook and hate cheese. How awkward is that?
4247,haha how interesting! I'll enjoy my vacation with that thought in mind
4247,What is the craziest thing you ate while on vacation?
4247,"Hmm, probably an octopus tentacle. Was not impressed!"
4247,I was not impressed the first time either but turns out it is delicious on the Bbq!
4247,"Ah, okay. Might give that a try this vacation then"
4247,i definitely recommend it ! what do you do for fun ?
4248,"Yes i need some time off from the kids, it adds up!"
4248,Yeah I love my two but they get on my nerves.
4248,"Oh you got it easy,i have five! lol"
4248,Five is so many. I don't know how I would handle any more. 
4248,Yes it gets hectic but also i love it and couldn't be happier! I love to crochet for all my kids
4248,I wish I knew how to crochet. 
4248,Its a great hobby! What are some of your hobbies?
4248,"I love to cook and work around the house. I'm a stay at home mom, so I have so much time to cook. "
4248,Oh nice! What are some of your favorite dishes to cook?
4248,I love to cook italian dishes with pasta.
4248,Pasta is one of my favorite foods!!
4248,"I hate how many carbs it has in it. I want to eat healthier, but I love carbs."
4249,"I have experimented baking with rose oil, but never the actual flower. Have you?"
4249,No just joking
4249,Do you like to cook?
4249,Yes. I tried out for a local cooking show and almost got in
4249,Wow that's very cool! What entree did you submit?
4249,Crawfish Bisque. I'm going to keep trying though
4249,Sounds delicious! What cooking show was it?
4249,Local show here in town
4249,Ah I see. Is crawfish bisque your signature dish to make? 
4249,Yes but i like cooking anything with seafood
4249,I love to make a shrimp scampi. Where do you shop for your seafood?
4249,Usually right off the boat. I live close to the gulf
4250,I wonder what type of flavors are there in in India. I wish I could visit there.
4250,There are such a variety at the grocery store of flavors inspired by India. i just ask the stockers and they helped me find it.
4250,I really want to move to another country. American life is getting to be disappointing.
4250,I can definitely emphasize with that. I prefer a much cooler climate since i work construction in the summer. It can get HOT
4250,I can relate to the hot weather. I live in Mississippi and this past summer was one of the hottest on record.
4250,The weather in my state has also been hotter than it ever has been in years prior. Do you think that could be due to global warming?
4250, It's most definitely due to global warming. There are now extremes in the weather it be cold or hot.
4250,"Yeah, it has been extreme. Once while i was on a job in the road, i passed out from the heat and that has never happened to me before."
4250,It can really be dangerous. This past Summer was the worst for my vegetable garden.
4250,"Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. I don't eat vegetables at all. My diet is mainly dairy , mostly ice cream. lol. keeps me cool"
4250,There is NO way that I can live without vegetables.
4250," Vegetables are gross to me, maybe if i was able to blend them together with chocolate ice cream and make a smoothie? What do you think ?"
4251,Nope i dont
4251,"Oh, I turned my passion for cooking into a career. "
4251,Are you a chef?
4251,"I sure am, and a really good one at that."
4251,where do you work?
4251,At an Italian restaurant. But my real job is selling paper products. 
4251,what kind of products?
4251,"Plain sheets of paper, toilet paper, paper towels, etc. "
4251,cool! How did you get into that?
4251,Just something I decided to do until my cooking career takes off. 
4251,do you have a specialty dish?
4251,My specialty is lasgna for sure. 
4252,how old is heÉ
4252,I don't know how old he is.
4252,how is the weather there ?
4252,"It's nice now.  It's been hot, but cooled down.  How about where you are?"
4252,Days are getting colder. snow soon.
4252,"I love the snow at first.  But then I get tired of it.  If there's too much, I can't go shopping."
4252,i do my shopping online 
4252,"I'm curious, why?  I don't particularly like it when people get too close to me.  Is that why?"
4252,to save time and stay home with it is warm
4252,That makes sense.  Where do you do most of your online shopping?
4252,amazon and costco
4252,"I love amazon.  I used to shop at Costco, but gave up the membership a few years ago."
4253,I love photography! Do you like to play videogames?
4253,"I dont play a lot anymore, the whole micro-transactions becoming the new standard is a huge turn off. I do however chase northern lights for amazing pictures!"
4253,"Me too, I like video games, but older ones without all the MT's. I've never seen the Northern Lights, but would love too, I hear they are amazing."
4253,Its an experience thats for sure. If you can endure the cold that is.
4253,"Oh, that's right, I forgot that you can typically only see them in areas that are cold. Do you travel at all?"
4253,All the time. If you're smart you can do it for cheap. Hike somewhere remote and take pictures
4253,I used to hike and camp all the time in the Rockies. Now I am too busy to travel unfortunately.
4253,"Nice, im actually going to the rockies in 2 weeks. I try to go at least twice a year."
4253,"I am envious. I would love to go again, though I would need to find someone to feed my turtles."
4253,Would you believe me if I told you I had a turtle when I was a kid and my sister ate it?
4253,Whoa. That sounds just crazy enough to be true! Though one has to ask how that happened?!
4253,I just walked in the room and the little tail was sticking out of her mouth. She ended up with purple zits on her tongue ahah
4253,I will bet she will never eat turtle again!
4254,"The Walking Dead is a classic show, I watched it all.  Anime is great as well.  Ever see Sailor Moon?"
4254,"No, I haven't but I do like reading game of thrones. I'm sure you've heard of that?"
4254,"Of course!  I had a hard time getting into it, but once I did I had to binge watch the whole thing."
4254,"Haha, I think that happened to most people. Whats your favorite book series?"
4254,Probably Enders Game.  Don't know if you like SciFi.  I read the series after my grandparents died.
4254,"Oh, i'm sorry to hear that, but I LOVE sci-fi. My favorite book series is Harry Potter though. Stereotypically lol"
4254,My grandmother loved the Harry Potter books.  I really missed her after she died.
4254,"Well at least you have her lasting memory, and the books to read time and time again in her memory."
4254,"Yes, that's true.  Who is your favorite character from the Harry Potter series?"
4254,"Hmm, I have to go with Hagrid. He's a big softy that looks out for everyone. You'd never expect it looking at him lol"
4254,That's a good choice!  He actually reminds me of a character from an anime series.  I love watching anime
4254,"I enjoy anime, nut I always find it difficult to find shows I really enjoy"
4255,"Yes, I love to grill! I live in the south and we are the BEST at grilling."
4255,"I love the south,I have family in Atlanta!"
4255,I live in Mississippi and I am 6 hours from Atlanta.
4255,"Very cool,what time of the year its the best to visit Mississippi?"
4255,The best time is in the Spring or Fall. You don't want to come this way in the summer. It's WAY too hot then!!
4255,Thats a good tip! I'll have to plan something for the Spring then
4255,It's nothing like it used to be when it comes to racism. Things have changed.
4255,Thats good to hear! Means there have been progress!
4255,"Yes, and even though many people who live in other parts of the country think it's the same, it's not."
4255,Yea i've heard people saying nothing has changed in the south but i dont think thats true!
4255,"It's not, it's just that people who know the old south still think that it is still the old south."
4255,Exactly they are stuck in the old days!
4256,"I have never been to Asia, it is on my bucket list for sure! What would you recommend for a first time traveler to Asia?"
4256,i try and pick a new place each time so i can learn about different cultures
4256,That sounds like a dream! I have 3 children so traveling is a little hard
4256,do you like the colder weather ?
4256,"To visit, yes. I've lived in the south for 25 years so I can't imagine living in it again."
4256,i try to go to a new place every summer
4257,A porsche 911 turbo. Silver model.
4257,Those are nice cars! They go really fast. I had a classmate once who owned a red porsche
4257,My love for the car came from playing one of my favorite video games - Need for Speed. Have you ever played?
4257,"No, I've never played it. Sounds like that is your passion. My passion in life has been studying and traveling"
4257,I do enjoy playing video games! I also like to travel though. Where have you traveled?
4257,"Gosh, I've been all over the world as I am a navy brat. Can you believe in 12 years I have attended 16 different schools!!"
4257,Wow! That is a lot of moving! Where was your favorite place to live in?
4257,By far Hawaii was my favorite place to live. I accomplished a lot of my goals in becoming a special education teacher while in Hawaii also.
4257,Oh I bet Hawaii was beautiful. Did you develop a love for pineapples while you were there?
4257,yes i did ! I love pineapple. Did you know they are extremely high in vitamin C which is great for your health and immune system? ?
4257,I do too! I did not know that! Great fact. I eat a lot of pineapple since I live alone and get to shop for myself! 
4257,"Do you mind living alone? I hope you are not lonely. Being a navy brat i was also apart of a huge family, never by myself for long."
4258,I should but I am always busy
4258,It really helps me get through my rough weeks
4258,why are your weeks bought?
4258,Oh just work is boring so chess allows me to escape 
4258,"that's true, it's a good escape"
4258,What is your hobby?
4258,soccer
4258,I've never been able to get into soccer
4258,why not?
4258,Just bores me running back and forth
4258,but you get to exercise
4258,Yes. I enjoy exercise but need to change it up. I prefer a circuit workout
4259,I was 23 when I first started playing.
4259,Did you play in college?
4259,"Yes, I played at the University of Florida, also known as the Florida Gators when it comes to football.."
4259,Nice! What position did you play?
4259,I was a receiver for three years and a back up quarterback during my last year.
4259,Thats cool! My husband is a University of Arkansas Alumni. We are fans of the razorback football team
4259,The Razorbacks are a great team. I once visited the U of A before I decided on a university.
4259,"Very nice,what made you choose University of Florida?"
4259,"I like the marine-type life that Florida has. I was never a big fan of large bodies of water, but Florida changed my mind on that."
4259,Yea and the weather its great over there year round!
4259,That's the best part of it all. It's never really TOO cold there but the summers can sometimes be a little bit unbearable.
4259,Oh yea for sure! Which city do you live in?
4260,"I'm a gas station cashier, and I operate the milkshake blenders sometimes"
4260,I can eat less but drink more
4260,That sounds like alcoholism mixed with an eating disorder. Be kind to your body.
4260,I mean I like drinking juice milshakes etc more then eating
4260,"haha well I'm turning 26 in May, so when I hear drink, i think alcohol. Apologies lol"
4260,I do not drink alcohol at all.
4260,Cool
4260,I like drawing. mostly ponies
4260,I'm more of a landscape person. I love capturing scenes in action.
4260,I like looking at the pictures in the scenes in comic books
4260,Haha. Reminds me of my favorite childhood comic series Captain Underpants
4260,Oh man! I grew up on that cartoon too!
4261,"Yes, I've talked to her and she seems to be ok with my decision, but deep down, I know she isn't."
4261,Maybe you can take her out for a nice dinner to make it up to her.
4261,"That's a great idea, and I just nay do that, but I really wish that I had chosen to help them instead of choosing the party."
4261,"Yea i know how you feel,but you cant take time back so you might as well forgive yourself and try to amend things "
4261,"That's true, there are times when we take the ""heavily-traveled road instead of the less-traveled on."
4262,I like to pratice baseball when its nice outside
4262,I like to be the pitcher at baseball. It's fun.
4262,best part of the game. 
4262,"I went to see the Detroit tigers play when I was a kid, my dad took me. "
4262,very nice ! I visited Detroit once.
4262,"Yes, but it's hard getting through traffic, and the bus is terrifying to me."
4262,oh true i love staying home and reading books
4262,Me too! But my passion is music. I even listen to music when I'm reading.
4262,I do love music and history 
4262,"Yes, I love history too. Thinking about history and music, have you seen the new show about the history of music?"
4262,"I did not know about that show, I will look that up"
4262,"Like I said, music is my passion. I listen to it all the time, probably 6 or 7 hours a day at least."
4263,"Ah, cool. My 53 years of southern food has led me to be obese."
4263,"But at least you enjoyed the food, I hope.  What else do you enjoy?"
4263,"Not walking, that's for sure! What about you?"
4263,I like listening to country music.  Sometimes i run to Zach Brown Band.
4263,I think I've heard my grand-kids mention that band before. I personally enjoy One Republics old stuff
4263,I'm somewhat familiar with them.  Maybe I will listen to them at work.  How many grand-kids do you have?
4263,"Definitely check out All This Time, Can't Stop, Passenger, and the whole DOL album. Just 3"
4263,Awesome.  Will do.
4263,Theyre kind of sad song but I definitely enjoy them. 
4263,"We'll check it out.  Depends upon the mood you're in, I guess.  Do you work?"
4263,"Nope, i'm too old and obese, so I retired."
4263,What did you do before you retired?
4263,"Hey, nice meeting you, Goodbye"
4264,I love thrift shopping. I like finding cool second hand dark clothes
4264,You can find some good stuff when you look.  I thrift b/c poor college student
4264,"Yea that definitely helps,they have good prices on some stuff!"
4264,Yeah - good b/c I grew up poor b/c my mom was just a janitor
4264,What are you in college for now?
4264,I have a dual major - accounting and international relations
4264,"Oh wow,thats very impressive! Do you like it so far?"
4264,Int'l relations is fascinating; accounting is meh - but hopefully a job at graduation
4264,"Yea thats a good profession,you should be able to find a job easy!"
4264,I hope!  Are youin school?
4264,"No,i finished school three years ago. I work at a hotel now"
4264,Do you like it?  You must meet interesting people all the time
4265,"Yes, I am ok, but her death was just a shock to the family."
4265,That'
4265,That is what?
4265,"Sorry, I accidentally hit enter. That is so Horrible. I've been sober now for several years, but it still has affected my body."
4265,"No problem, I really wish that she had taken the route that you did. Things would probably be different now."
4265,It's hard. I still struggle sometimes. I think one big help is having a hobby. Mine is pottery making.
4265,I can understand the difficulty it it. I tried pottery when I was in college. It was really a challenge for me.
4265,"It took me forever to get the hang of it. But the best thing is, if you are angry or frustrated, you can just smash it down and start over."
4265,That's an interesting take on dealing with anger and frustration. Does it work?
4265,"It does for me. Helped me through some hard times. I know you're dealing with a loss, maybe it could help you."
4265,I just may take you up on that advice. I really need to find something that will relax me.
4265,"If you didn't want to go anywhere, you can get a cheap little pottery wheel online, and see if you like it."
4266,"cool.  Virginia, just outside of DC."
4266,I live more up north it is starting to get colder
4266,"Gotcha.  Yeah, it's getting cooler here too.  I don't make it to the park as often as I did during the summer."
4266,staying inside and listening to classical music is my thing
4266,That sounds nice.  I prefer listening to podcasts.
4266,"podcasts are amazing , i prefer them to tv ."
4266,"Yeah, I feel like I get so much more out of them.  Pro-tip, listen to them at 1.5x speed and you can get through so many more."
4266,I like that will use it ! time is money
4266,yeah.  you have to get used to it.  Cause it's fast.  My wife hates listening at 1.5x speed.
4266,having three kids I have to wear headphones
4266,that makes sense.  you can also find podcasts for them too!
4266,i will have to look into those for kids podcast 
4267,"Video games, but the oldies. Like Mario, Tetris, that stuff."
4267,Tetris used to be one of my favorite old school games. My hobbies are drone-flying and drawing. Just two of the many I have.
4267," Wow, that's cool. I've been thinking about checking out drone-flying. But I can barely draw a stick figure, lol."
4267,It can be intimidating when you first start because you have to familiarize yourself with the dynamics of flying one and then move from there.
4267,"Sounds like fun. I like things that are calming, I have a stressful job. "
4267,What is the type of work that you do? I work in Information Technology and I also repair and troubleshoot computers. That's another hobby of mine.
4267,"Wow! You are amazing. I'm a police officer, I depend on people like you to keep the computers going for me. "
4267,"I don't think I'm amazing, but I do believe that what I do is vital to the technological age that we now find ourselves in."
4267,It's amazing to me. My pre-teen knows more about computers than I do. I get her to fix mine sometimes.
4267,A lot of kids these days are addicted to technology. Does she listen to you often?
4267,"She is more into fixing computers than things like social media, so I don't have to get on to her about it."
4267,That's great! At least she's using her mind in a more productive way.
4268,yes i was but my friend played a prank on me and had someone follow me. I was so scared I ran. Some jokes take things too far.
4268,"Yeah, i'm a gas station cashier, so I know how scary those close calls can be. At least you're safe though"
4268,Gas station attendants have a risky job. Stay safe. I just can't believe my friend thought that was a good joke. 
4268,"Yeah, too far when someone fears bodily harm. My mom faced similar issues when she did ballet in London."
4268,"Ballet in London, what happened? "
4268,She just had to work really hard. It's very hard on your feet. At least her hard work gained her fame though
4268,Sorry for your mom pain. i was in ballet class as a child and we did a dance dressed as the Flintstones. i still like them today
4268,Wow sounds cool. Did you stop going?
4269,i like visiting thrift stores
4269,Yes I do as well. What are your best finds from the thirft store?
4269,I like finding old computer or game consoles
4269,what's your favorite console? I found a gameboy at the thrift once
4269,bought a gameboy on kijiji love it. my favorite console is the coleco
4269,that's an old one! My favorite is the SNES. I gave one to my son because my family is very important to me
4269,i love my kids I build them an arcade with a few hundred snes games build in
4269,that's amazing. I'd love to do something like that sometime. What's the best SNES game?
4269,I like playing mario cart 
4269,me too! that and star fox
4269,ahh yes star fox for sure 
4269,"My knee is filled with metal, kind of like slippys head from star fox"
4270,No. I was totally speeding. But I'm a baseball player from Miami University. People know me. I'm kinda important.
4270,So the stereotype is true - athletes do get special treatment?
4270,I can't really complain. I drew the long straw on that one. Ha ha. Are you an athlete? 
4270,"I enjoy playing recreational sports, but not an athlete.  Just a common working person."
4270,"Gotch . Well, us athletes are really advanced humans compared to you.  We're physically superior. "
4270,"Agree you are advanced physically!  So what else is interesting about you, besides sports?"
4270,"Not much really. I went to the U. So we pretty much just played sports, drank lots of beer, and did a bunch of drugs."
4270,Are you going pro after college?  What is your major?
4270,I'll probably go pro. We could have gone to state if coach just put me in. I know we could have. 
4270,Who are you pulling for in the World Series?
4270,Housto . I despise Washington. How about you? 
4270,Not one in particular.  In a way maybe Washington because it has been so long for them.
4271,Interesting
4271,Yes it is and the technology is rapidly evolving to the point where future telecommunications will seem like magic.
4271,Yeah I think so too I am interested in the evolution of the internet to see what will happen next
4271,Now that is something that I'm interested in seeing regards to the future of internet technology.
4271,Yeah I know with comcast now you can get 1gbit internet for like $200 a month
4271,And 1 gigabyte is a fast enough speed for the average home and even a few small businesses.
4271,Yeah it is a lot colleges used to have slower internet for a lot more money
4271,"I remember the old days when dial up was the only thing that we had, and if someone picked up the phone, the internet would disconnect."
4271,Yeah dial up was crazy lol
4271,Telecommunications have come a long way since those days and I'm eagerly anticipating what the future has in store.
4271,Yeah it will be nice to see what we can do next
4271,"One thing I do know is the days of the dial tone, the dialing, and that screeching AOL sound are long gone!"
4271,for sure
4272,"Oh, ok. Well I also make short films. I like to record myself tap dancing lol"
4272,Bob
4272,"My mom is also a well-known celebrity for her photography, so it runs in the family"
4272,Has she ever done Theatrical dancing? ive heard its interesting.
4272,"She's pretty adventurous, so it's likely she has, I personally prefer theatrical"
4272,"I guess I enjoy watching theatrical dance, I like when it is a performance!"
4272,Yes! That's why I often go to plays.
4272,I do as well give me some good music and I just be thinking I'm performing and doing lot's of movements lol.
4272,"haha. My favorite is The King and I, though I do enjoy tap dancing scenes"
4273,"Yea it was, question; are we having coffee? what are our surroundings?"
4273,"I love Starbucks! But I like to sit on the patio, especially when it's not busy. "
4273,after my buddy and I got over the awkwardness of why we hadn't seen each other for ages we started talking like we never left.
4273,That's awesome! I keep up with my old friends on Facebook. I love seeing their pics
4273,facebook's an awesome! my buddy agreed to come with me to visit an animal shelter Wednesday; you said you like your patio do you watch the sunset?
4273,"Yes, but I miss out on all the colors, because of my colorblindness. "
4274,I enjoy going on hikes so i get a lot hiking gear from there
4274,"My dad really likes hiking, he wants to hike the blue ridge trail"
4274,Oh yea i would lioe to hike it as well! What are some of your hobbies?
4274,"Hunting, fishing and computers."
4274,Where do you like to go for fishing?
4274,My favorite is salmon fishing in alaska
4274,Nice! Do you ever cook the fish you catch?
4274,"Yes, i cook every fish that i dont catch and release. Salmon is soooo good"
4274,Its one of my favorite fish to eat! How do you prepare it usually?
4274,I usually grill it but sometimes i smoke it as well
4274,Yes i like it grilled!
4274,It is so good. My grandma cooked the best salmon
4275,"Are you a composer, like Mozart? What specifically are you wanting your Master's in music for, if I may ask?"
4275,I have been a lover of music right from 6 years old
4276,honestly it switches back and forth depending what mood i'm in lol
4276,"Lobster!  It's the best!  Interestingly, travel came from the word "
4276,Lobsters are tasty lol red it my favorite color so maybe thats why i like them

4278,Right now i am in school which i hate studying to get my associate degree in massage therapy. I live at home on a lake with my parents.
4278,What do you like to do on the lake?
4278,I like to relax at the lake. I go there and meditate while looking across the lake. I clear my thoughts of hating school this way.
4278,oh. Meditating works. Unless you fall asleep and have a nightmare.
4278,"oh no, do you have nightmares? I feel for you if so. It is true that living on a lake can be very peaceful and provide beautiful scenery. "
4278,yes ! i have seen many ghosts in my lifetime. you are lucky to have a lake and parents to live with.
4278,"Gosh, i am so sorry that you see ghost? I would not want to experience that. Are you ok? I don't feel lucky as far as school goes"
4278,I am ok. I like to drink tea before bed it help to relaxe. it getting colder here these last days
4278,Tea is relaxing. Chamomile tea is known for its calming effects especially since it is caffeine free too. Our lakehouse is cold at nights.
4278,my thing is i have a cup of chai tea every night it helps me rest .
4278,I am glad you get rest. A good nights sleep is very important for your physical and mental health. Is Chai tea from India?
4278,Yes it is. I live up north in Canada. work as a computer tech
4278,Computer technology is a job very much in demand in this day and age. Congrats on such a lucrative job. What is Canada like?
4279,She broke her leg going down the stairs.
4279,I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anyone who's there to help her?
4279,"Well, my friend will be. Which will mess up the shooting of our reality tv show."
4279,"dayum! but at least his mumm will be looked after, anyone who can take his place?"
4279,"I'm looking into it. I have a friend who plays the guitar. She's thinking about it, at least temporarily."
4279,that's good to hear that there's someone who can step in during a crisis :)
4280,"That is cool.  Not a huge hockey fan myself.  More of a football fan, me and my friends from the bank watch it on Sundays."
4280,"Yeah, since I take care of my mother and she takes care of my grandmother, we just all watch it together"
4280,Family event.  Thats great.  What is your favorite team?
4280,Definitely gotta go with the Maple Leafs
4280,Ok.  You must be from Canada.  I am from the Dallas/Ft Worth area.  Followed the Stars in the 90s.  Quit after the strike.
4280,"Ah, no.  I get my 8 hours of sleep in the usa as well lol"
4280,"Ok, was just assuming.  Do you work or do you take care of your mother full time?"
4280,I also work. I do customer service
4280,Great.  Thats alot of responsibility working and taking care of someone.  I bet that gets rough sometimes.  
4280,"Yeah, but she took care of me as a kid, so it's a privilege to repay her"
4280,Amen to that.  I bet she appreciates that.  Alot of respect for you.  Not common in our culture anymore.
4280,"Yeah, unfortunately. These kids nowadays mistreat their parents and take them for granted constantly"
4281,If you would like I can teach you 
4281,"That sounds great, I love learning new skills! How do you start?"
4281,"The best thing to do is to develop interest first. after developing an interest, I will sit down with you and teach you"
4281,Where would I begin? I love to learn new hobbies late at night! Do you have any other interests?
4281,"I like swimming too, what out you"
4281,yes I have been swimming since I was young. It's very fun. I enjoy playing guitar
4281,"Wow, I love instruments, can you teach me"
4281,I only play guitar as a hobby so probably am not the best teacher but I use the internet to improve!
4281,"What you know is enough, as I teach you sewing, you will teach me playing guitar."
4281,Sounds like a solid deal. I'm in.
4281,"Good, when are you free?"
4281,Right now. First things first - you need to buy a guitar
4281,"Okay buddy, thanks for reminding. I have to go now and attend to other matters. "
4282,yes you need pratice to be good at it
4282,I guess it probably requires a lot of practice to get the technique down.
4282,what is your hobby ?
4282,I love music
4282,I like playing games at the arcade with the music playing in the background
4282,Those games do seem fun

4282,yes i totally agree with you .
4283,"It was a blast. It was at a friends house, she's the youngest of five. I am the only kid, so it was fun being with a big family."
4283,"Oh, definitely sounds fun. Since, i'm an exquisite guitar player, I get hired to do parties pretty often."
4283,Awesome! What's the best one you've done?
4283,Definitely an engagement party. It went off more like a bachelor party! lol
4283,"Awesome! My best friends bachelorette  party was fun! I was a redhead then, blonde now, who knows what next week lol.  "
4283,"Ah, life on the wild side eh? lol John Grisham is definitely a better actor than writer. Do you know him?"
4283,"I know the name, unfortunately I am lacking in that area."
4283,"Ah, ok. That's fine lol"
4283,"I don't spend enough time inside, lol. I love hiking, camping, and the outdoors. You?"
4283,"I also enjoy those things, but I'm also super introverted, so there's that haha"
4283,"It's funny. I am an introvert, but nobody believes me. So, maybe I'm just not super lol."
4283,"Yeah, usually if you're introverted people tell you so. "
4284,Any time. Y'all have been through so much together. Just relax.
4284,yeah we have been through alot. we are happier now then ever so i am relaxed.
4284,Awesome! Well come on over and binge on some Grey's Anatomy with me then. Unless you are otherwise occupied.....
4284,"haha Grey's Anatomy, I remember when it was popular. lets watch it!"
4284,Sounds like a plan! I'll get some wine chillin' and put together some nasty snacks to stuff our beautiful faces with!
4284,"hahah sounds like a plan cuz, um some whiskey shots? thats lit"
4284,I just happen to have some Skull Whiskey and some Maker's here with our names on them!
4284,wait actually? thats sick. i am bringing some chips as well.
4284,I got th dip Brocephus. Fly your whip with the chip to my crib with the dip!
4284,ahaha you got bars bruh
4284,"Like a Robert FRost on crack, yo"
4284,yo what? naa you have your own style 
4285,I used to live in New York and that is where i found my adorable cat. My cat has an unusual name. Leroy Jenkins
4285,Leeeeeerooooooyyyyy Jeeeeeennnnnkiiiinnnnssss! We learned about that between classes at my high school. 
4285,"LOL. What did you learn ? Oh Gosh when i think of my high school days and the clothes that i would wear, i crinch."
4285,I go to w catholic high school so we mostly learn about God which is great. But it also keeps my somewhat sheltere . 
4285,I'm sorry to hear that. Catholic schools are easier as far as wearing uniforms. The suspenders i used to wear in school hurt my shoulders badly.
4285,We're you wearing suspenders that were too small? 
4285,"Yes, they were way too small. My shoulder pain was crazy. Anyway, back to the topic of my cat Leroy  Jenkins, she is a female cat. lol"
4286,what happened?  What did you steal?
4286,"I needed food for my kids, so I took some chicken. I've never felt so bad in my life. But really needed it"
4286,oh man.  sorry you were in that situation.  Got to do what you got to do.  I hate my current job.  But i go.
4286,"I'm very much the same, my wife's ill, I hardly see her but I keep working to support her and the kids, their comfort makes me feel good"
4286,that's commendable of you.
4286,you got a family?
4286,i do.  3 kids.  All 7 years and younger.
4286,"Hey! good on'ya mate, I guess y'know where I'm comming from; supporting others cause you want to love and protect them?"
4286,i do.  got to keep them safe and healthy.  that's the most important thing.  What else do you do for fun?
4286,"fun, I love reading, studying languages and trying to earn an extra dime, you?"
4286,"playing guitar, working out and hustling like you."
4286,"hey guitar! sounds great, I pull one out and pluck it but have my fingers in too many pies, how long you been playing?"
4286,since college.  I've got a blue guitar.  My favorite color!
4287,I have a lot of hoarders in the family.
4287,"Me too, my mother is really bad with it, her reasoning is that she holds a lot of value in all of her things."
4287,"Although my family doesn't hoarde shoes, they hoard food."
4287,I think that food is an okay thing to stockpile in case of disaster.
4287,My parents hoard food because they lived through the Great Depression and were hungry much of the time.
4287,"Understandable, I think that life experiences can lead to hoarding later."
4287,"I definitely agree. I think psychologically, people are afraid something will happen to them and they are staving against it happening."
4287,"Other things can lead to people becoming hoarders as well, like civil unrest or natural disaster."
4287,That is so true. I cannot think of a reason a person needs 500 pairs of shoes though.
4287,"500 pairs of shoes is definitely way too many.  If she was unwilling to discard the items and the shoes were covering up living areas, I would hate it."
4287,I would love to know her reason behind so many pairs of shoes.
4287,"I have no idea, if I knew I'd tell you."
4287,Have a great evening. Great talking with you.
4287,"you as well , have a great night ."
4288,I work as a high school teacher. I teach German language and culture
4288,"Awesome. Where are you from? My parents were born in Algeria, but me, good old USA"
4288,I am also from the USA. Did your parents move here for work-related reasons?
4288,"Yes, to get some lol. Also, for an education. They were young when they came and both have great jobs. Me? just a barista lol."
4288,That's awesome! Are you going to school now? Any specific plans for the future?
4288,"I'm part-time, taking some pre-reqs right now. But I want to be a nurse. I just want to do it on my own, without my parents' help."
4288,That's a great goal to have. It sounds like you have a great work ethic!
4288,"I learned from the best. But more about you, what do you do for fun?"
4288,"I love cars, so I follow the automotive industry and go on cruises on the weekend."
4288,"Awesome. I went to the Woodward Dream Cruise in Detroit this summer. Ever been? Old cars driving down the road, like a parade/"
4288,"I've never been to Woodward before, but I would love to go. Normally, I go to Carlisle in PA"
4288,"Cool. I have family in Detroit, so that's what took me there."
4289,"my dog loves the snow, idk what it is but it gets so happy when it sees snow"

4290,"half way, when not writing I relaxe working puzzles"
4290,"Wow, I see you like complex things, no wonder you are a fiction writer?"
4290,"The weather being getting colder these days, slows me down."
4290,"Yeah, the cold weather can be discouraging, but that's nature. Just continue working bit by bit you will get there. What are your other hobbies?"
4290,"I love music, I like to practice playing the guitar"
4290,"I know how to play guitar and piano, I can help you learn if you would like"

4291,That sounds fun! What do you normally bake?
4291,"I love baking sweets, dougnuts, danishes, it's full on but it's so much fun"
4291,I don't think I could ever do that. I love my job too much to ever give that a try!
4291,"haha! it does sound like you have a beaut job, I dunno there's always something great about trying new things..."
4291,"Yeah I always say that, but I would never give up my job. I love the free merch lol"
4291,"ah! yep, yep! free Nike merch does sound like a really good incentive haha! I'm a gotta keep my mind busy guy if I don't I'd die ;)"

4295,"I only get headaches when wearing my glasses for extended periods of time, could my glasses magnify too much?"
4295,"Maybe that could be a problem, you will need to see your optician as soon as possible"
4295,Is there anything I can do to help this in the meantime? I know if I don't wear my glasses my vision will just get worse.
4295,"Not that I know of, the immediate solution will be looking up for answers over the internet"

4296,hahah well looks like i am not visiting my cousins soon 
4297,"yeah, I don't know about that Ronaldo dude, he seems like kind of a pud IMO."
4297,He is the best player in the world.
4297,How can you really know that though?
4297,"Come on, everybody knows that."
4297,But seriously.... what about all of the absolutely phenomenal unknown players who are just playing around in their neighborhoocds?
4297,"I'm sure there are many people with raw talent out there, but when they are good enough they will get discovered."
4297,Do you really believe that is always the case?
4297,"Not always, there are many undiscovered athletes that are just unlucky and we'll never know about them."
4297,"True, but I think we can all agree that the greatest player ever is without a doubt Canadian!"
4297,"Lol, we'll just have to agree to disagree."
4297,"I guess so.... but still, Ronaldo?? I'm not convinced, Brotato chip."
4297,I'm convinced he's the best and nothing can change my mind.

4298,what kind of food was it ?
4298,"French fries and and Juice, "
4298,There is nothing like a hot and crispy order if fries is there?
4298,"I guess not,anyway, has anything like that happened to you?"
4298,"Luckily not, I don't eat out much because I'm trying to save as much money as I can."
4298,"That's good of you, saving is always a good thing, do you have a goal though? "

4298,"Good, you will as long as you are determined. I live in my apartment already."
4298,Any other tips you could give me for living by myself?
4298,"Just be sure you have enough money to pay your apartment,and try to be responsible always"
4299,"Yes, I always make sure I know where the exits are. It's a little scary. "
4299,why are you anxious ? how old are you ? i sleep so much that i feel like my anxiety levels aren't usually very high. i'm not very alert.
4299,"I just worry that something could happen. You never know, right? But I'm not going to stop going to the movies. "
4299,"Life is a scary place, anything could happen at any time. I like to distract myself with music like Bruno Mars or other upbeat artists. What about you?"
4299,I love Pink Floyd. But I guess they are not very upbeat. 
4299,"That may be true, but I just don't like their sound. I prefer the music of Cuba! Which is influenced heavily by west African and European music."
4299,I can't think of any Cuban music that I know. Who are some Cuban artists that I might have heard?
4299,Probably La Isla Bonita. I love the Cuban influence.
4299,Isn't that a Madonna song?

4299,It's a good song!

4300,"Nice! BMW seems like a common car nowdays, seems like you've found your niche market ;)"
4300,i mean you are not wrong. but like they are expensive 
4301,Ah really. I have taught kids Literature in my spare time as a part-time tutor. 
4301,What grade levels do you tutor in Literature?
4301,I taught grades 5-7 during my time. What about you?
4301,6th grade.  An interesting age!
4301,Yes it is. So many of the kids love talking about their interests and hobbies. It's a wonderful job.
4301,True!  What hobbies do you have outside of teaching and tutoring?
4301,"I used to spend much of my time reading. Lately, I have been enjoying painting. It's a very relaxing hobby for me."
4301,I took some painting classes once. I was too self conscious to relax - my paintings seemed weird.
4301,There's beauty in all kinds of paintings. I'm sure that they are beautiful in their own unique way.
4301,Perhaps.  My hobbies are crosswords and crocheting.
4302,wow really. i wonder how people found all this information out. my parents were actually scientists and i am one as well.
4302,"It's bewildering! but it's amazing when following philosophies history, take the history of medicine! human biopsies wern't allowed"

4304,That's why I joined the IT industry.
4304,Is IT your passion or you are in it for the money or other reasons? 
4304,More like it was passed on to me from my father.
4304,"I see, have you grown to love it or you just do it for the family's sake"
4304,A little of both I think. It's what I always wanted to do because that's what my Dad did and I wanted to be just like him.
4304,"Wow, I am a media person. I love everything communication and production"
4304,"Nah, not me, I prefer to be alone with my computer and music. In the zone."
4304,"Yeah, IT requires a lot of concentration and thinking"
4304,"Yeah, but I don't mind it sometimes.  And sometimes when something isn't working right, it can get real frustrating."
4304,"I can guess, thinking can be hard more so when you are working under instructions from a client"
4304,It is. Most of the time they don't even know exactly what they want.
4304,"Very true, but they demand it anyway. You just have to talk with them and get the balance right I guess"
4305,you used to live in russia? i love russia. i took the trans siberian all the way to moscow about 5 years ago
4305,"Yes, Russia is a very interesting nation."
4305,"how do you feel about the poverty there? i'm very concerned about this issue worldwide, but i find i annoy people obsessing about it"
4305,It has a high degree of poverty in some areas.
4305,definitely agree. i hope i don't come across as annoying or unlikeable because i care about the poor communities so much.
4306,"I love to read, and used to do a lot of writing, but no time for it now."
4306,I love to read and write in my free time.
4306,What other books have you read recently?
4306,"I read a lot of hello kitty  Sanrio books, does that count?"
4306,"To me, any reading counts! If you're reading, you're learning!"
4306,"true , true . Reading is power just wish I could earn money doing it!"
4306,No doubt! I just had a run of bad luck and ended up on welfare last month.
4306,"Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that! I hope things start looking better for you. Can you file for disability or social security?"
4306,"No, just had a job change and several big expenses hit unexpectedly. I'm sure it'll turn around, though."
4306,"oh , sorry to hear that . do not worry i'm sure things will turn around soon ."
4306,"Yeah, I try not to worry about stuff, and I'm sure it'll turn out OK. Thanks for the support!"
4306,You are welcome. I'm in a tough spot with my pen obsession.
4307,"No, but I'm glad they came"
4307,It's always nice to have some good friends.
4307,"Yeah, he told me how he has been traveling place to place"
4308,That does sound really interesting to be honest!
4308,People think sewing is a wimpy hobby but being able to make your own clothes is pretty metal. 
4308,What I enjoy most of all is taking an old but nice vintage piece of clothing found while thrifting and creating something new out of it!
4308,That's really cool. What kind of things have you made? 
4308,"I've made a few jumpers from jean materials, Bags but mainly messenger style, Kids dresses, skirts! I've even made a few bowties."
4308,"That sounds really interesting, you must have a lot of skill. "
4308,I'm not terrible though I do have room to improve. I believe there is always more to learn on every topic and in all skills.
4308,I like embroidery too but it takes so long to make anything. 
4308,Where did you learn to do that?
4308,"You can buy a kit with all the supplies and it will have instructions, but it is hard to make some of the stitches. "
4308,That makes sense. It's similar to how I learned to knit.
4308,I tried knitting but it was too hard. 
4309,aw i am sorry
4309,"It's OK, I have my iguanas to keep me company"
4309,what are those 
4309,My pet lizards.
4309,ohhh i remember what they are. thats cute!
4309,"I got them because they looked funny, then I just fell in love with them."
4309,awww you think i can meet them?
4309,I think they'd like that. Especially Monty you can't usually tell but he's the shy one.
4309,when are u free? how does tomorrow sound?
4309,That sounds great. How about noon? 
4309,yeah i am free all day tomorrow 
4309,"Sure maybe we can get lunch, but it has to be somewhere cheap."
4310,Right? I haven't had such a terrible dream since I was a child.
4310,"Dreams can be scary, but do not worry so much about it. Just ensure your daughter is well taken care of"
4310,"Thank you for your wise words, I will take them to heart. I believe she is, between my wife and I we show her heaps of love."
4310,"That is good of you, children need to be showered with much love. I also have a little boy"
4310,You do? How wonderful. What might his name be?
4310,He is called Blessing because I believe he is a blessing to my life 
4310,"This is a wonderful name! My daughter is named Praise, because I give praise for her wellbeing."
4310,"Wow, what a profound name, how old is she?"
4310,She is 8 years old. And how old is your son?
4310,"He is 3 now, but looks like a big boy already. I hope they can be friends maybe"
4310,"Yes me as well. One day, when he is bigger they can be friends and play. But for now he is still so young, and cute!"
4310,"I told you he behaves like a grownup, one day when he is old they can play together I guess"
4311,That's so interesting. Do you like baking?
4311,"Well yes, i love to bake. Plus, baking has been around for thousands of years so i figured its something people will always want"
4311,That's true. And I love baking too. Wedding cakes are definitey my specialty
4311,Have you ever made a civil war themed wedding cake before? 
4311,no way sounds amazing though
4311,"My mother is getting married soon and a big time celebrity, could you make one?"
4311,"of course, if you like! i can send you some of my previous work"
4311,I would love it if you would! I'm in charge of the cake. 
4311,thats so exciting!
4311,Yes it is. Its going to be a huge event and could bring some business your way!
4311,when is the big day??
4311,Tuesday :O
4312,"I like the water, I enjoy swimming at the Y because the water there is so blue."
4312,"My favorite color is yellow because it's the brightest color of all, just me."
4312,You must enjoy the sun then?
4312,"Yeah, that's why I love summer time, the beach, sunny days,  and all night Forth of July parties."
4312,Probably enjoy the golden arches too huh?
4312,"Sure do, chicken nuggets and fries anytime of day."
4312,"LOL...so why yellow, just your personality or what?"
4312,"I don't know, I guess it always spoke to me on a personal level."
4312,Prob the same way blue does to me I guess.
4312,"You know if you mix blue and yellow together, you get green."
4312,The color of money...and that was also a great movie
4312,It's also the color of vegetation.
4313,yeah i do as well 
4313,"I have to be super careful of where I go to eat, shellfish is in all kinds of stuff you wouldnt think of"
4313,"true, good thing no one in my family like sea food."
4313,Not just seafood. 
4313,wait you have to look out for more?
4313,"lots of Asian sauces have fish or shellfish, and Caesar salad dressing "
4313,omg so true. i need to look out for them 
4313,"It's scary, I wonder what people who had allergies did before modern medicine. "
4313,yeah thats somthing to think about 
4313,It seems like people have more allergies these days but I think it is just that we notice them more. 
4313,very true. i wonder if i have more allergies and just not know about them 
4313,You should talk to your doctor about it. 
4314,I was nervous alcohol could get into my bloodstream and take effect on me
4314,"Yeah, that's usually how drinking works.  Your job must be really stressful."
4314,I handled a troublesome client and felt really bad
4314,"Tell me about it, I've been there before.  But that's not going to help you out, it actually makes the situation worse."
4315,Yes that was a very sad time. Who was your favorite member of the band?
4315,"I think Niall, Liam, Harry, Louis and Zayn at the onset. do you like video games as well?"
4315,"Yes, I do. Especially Fifa. I want to be a footballer one day"
4315,yes i love fifa too! the music is so catchy i find myself humming the songs all day
4315,"Yes me as well! I think the best song was the main menu theme, how about you?"
4315,yeah it's a catchy one for sure
4315,How about your favourite player? Mine was Ronaldo
4315,i like messi best. did you know he uses an inhaler? i need to use one as well so that fact about messi makes me feel like of a nerd
4315,"I did not know that, that is very interesting."
4315,yea he is the best player in the world.
4316,"You are nice to talk to also, what is your name?"
4316,"Harmony. I hope we don't have to wait too much longer, I am getting hungry. "
4317,"Oh cool! I used to live there too, I was a line cook at a restaurant."
4317,i worked at a restaurant when i was in school . helped pay the bills
4317,"I love to cook, I'm still doing it now. What do you do now?"
4317,college mainly
4317,What are you studying?
4317,law and natural resource
4317,I would have loved to study law. I'm studying IT and business currently.
4317,"Nice, IT kind of interests me thats why I am into mturk stuff"
4317,"Yeah IT is so broad, you can always make money off of it and learn new things."
4317,"Yes, it is rapidly expanding"
4317,"I wish I could just keep cooking, but it doesn't pay the bills!"
4317,"Yeah, in High School I wanted to go into wildlife biology but had the same issue they made barely more than minimum. "
4318,I am in New York City.
4318,"I could never live in a city, I need space and water. "
4318,"I used to be that way, but then i tried Pizza in New York and I had to move here. I also love the sound of cars."
4318,"Give me a boat any day. The sound of the sea and the waves, it is peaceful. "
4318,So true. Where would you take a boat?
4318,Wherever I can find land. I have been to many different places. 
4318,Oh? What was your favorite place?
4318, L'Anse aux Meadows
4318,"Wow, that sounds amazing. Where is that?"
4318,"Newfoundland, in Canada"
4318,"I love Canada. I have been once, to Quebec."
4318,It is a beautiful country. 
4319,oh that's cool. do you know if there are any rock concerts there soon? i love classic rock
4319,Not sure.   Concerts get to rowdy for me.  
4319,yeah i get that. i prefer more low key things anyway. what do you like to do?
4319,bars and gambling
4319,haha sounds fun to me. i prefer low key weekends like getting ice cream or smoothies
4319,"Not for me, I'm not moving there to be a good boy."
4319,haha that's fine. i want to own a smoothie shop someday. what do you do for work?
4319,A fast food place and I saving up all my money so I can move to Las Vegas.
4319,oh neat. i'm sure you'll have a fun time there
4319,Me too.  I hear it's pretty dangerous so I'm going to take a lot of self-defense classes before I go.
4319,like mma or karate or jiu jitsu?
4319,All kinds.  I gonna be an underground streetfighter.
4320,It is amazing to think about how people did things in the past. We take simple things like needles for granted.
4320,"Yes, I think that it it something that a lot of people overlook these days"
4320,Most people would just probably buy a new shirt if a button fell off. It's wasteful. 
4320,"I agree, things were made to last for a very long time. No wasting resources"
4320,"I think things these days were not made to last as long, but only because people don't expect them too. "
4320,"Yes, and that is part of the problem. We must reduce our waste."
4320,What do you think is the best way to get people to be less wasteful?
4320,"Many things. For example, we could ban plastic bags."
4320,I have noticed a lot of stores are using different types of plastic bags. I think they might be recycled. 
4320,What a great idea! Who do we write letters to to get that to happen?
4320, It's towns and cities that can ban these things so the mayors and city council I think? 
4320,Does your city council usually have a large agenda or list of items to be acted on?
4320,I'm not sure. I'm not very political. 
4321,I love swimming
4321,"Yeah I love being outside, "
4321,Do you like hiking?
4321,Hiking is fun I wish I had more time to go out. Do you hike a lot?
4321,"Yeah, mostly during weekends, why can't you join me one day?"
4321,Weekends are actually when I am busiest with my occupation and school
4321,"Okay, then it is not as easy because weekdays I work, what is your specialty"
4321,Environmental conservation currently. What is your field?
4321,"Media is my passion, Such an interesting field you are in. I love nature"
4321,"Yes, there can be quite a bit of media in conservation. "
4321,"Very true, do you believe in environmental conservation?"
4321,"I do, I think there is a balance in being efficient with what we use. Both business and nature can succeed. "
4321,"Wise thought, I think so too."
4321,"Thanks, media also is pretty interesting. Everyone uses it."
4322,"my mom was a piano teacher, so i'm learning to play the piano now for her"
4322,Wow! Maybe I should start taking some piano lessons and go to a recital of my own.
4322,that would be lovely. what is your home life like?
4322,"It is good. I do the shopping, while my significant other has a job."
4322,"that sounds like a good way to divide things up. my husband brought home a cat the other day, but i'm allergic. so the cat has to go! haha"
4322,"I see. lol. I do not like cats, so i do not want one in my house either!"
4322,yes i'd much rather have a puppy! do you like dogs?
4322,"Yes, I do.  Currently I have a poodle.  How about you?"
4322,"i don't have a dog, but i would really like one. maybe a golden retriever or a smaller terrier dog"
4322,A yorkshire Terrier might be a good choice. It is a toy dog and is a popular companion dog.
4322,yes they are very cute as well
4322,they are . so what do you do for fun ?
4323,"Fantastic, I'm fond of Mozart myself"
4323,who is your favorite painter ?
4324,Thats very intersting. Australia is somewhere I have always wanted to visit
4324,"I hear Australia is lovely and would love to visit one day, myself."
4324,Yes. Do you travel much?
4324,"I love to travel, but haven't much since having a child. For now, I stick to short roadtrips."
4324,"Yeah, that would make it tough. Even without kids I still don't have a lot of time to set aside to traveling"
4324,What keeps you so busy?
4324,"Mainly family, school, and work. "
4324,What are you going to school for and how much longer until you graduate?
4324,"Environmental resources, 2 years. are you in College or have a degree?"
4324,"I was attending a univerity, but took a break from to travel and experience life. "
4324,"Nice, what is your focus area?"
4324,"Engineering was my degree plan. However, I was easily destracted with social justice issues and studies."
4324,Environmental engineering is a good cross section I have found between those issues
4324,Great suggestion. What inspired you studies?
4324,Always loved being outside. Also I have always been a policy and politics nerd I guess. 
4325,"I think so. Mostly, I'll be relieved to know for certain."
4325,do you usually do your homework at home?
4325,"No. I prefer to study on a patio of a cafe. Between work and school, I try to outdoors as much as possible."
4325,me too. i like being at home more than being out and about
4325,What sort of hobbies do you have?
4325,"I read a lot of hello kitty  Sanrio books, does that count?"
4325,"Hahaha, absolutely!! Is Hello Kitty actually a cat?"
4325,"i think so, but some controversy about that. my friend and i are in a band together as well. do you like music?"
4325,How genre does your band play? I have quite and eclectic taste. I listen to anything from Tupac to Tchaikovsky.
4325,kind of acoustic folksy
4325,What instrument do you play?
4325,guitar. can you play any instruments?
4326,Body piercing is something which we can't do 
4326,"I agree, but some people love it"
4326,But tattoos are fine compared to them and looks good on us.As a Canadian I love to have tattoos. 
4326,How many tattoos do you have?
4326,I have a tattoo over my chest and left shoulder.I am planning to have more in the future.
4326,"Wow, that is good. I have none and I do not necessarily planning to have them "
4326,Cool.Tattoos are not the most important ones in our lives.
4326,"It depends with preferences of someone, do you love them a lot"
4326,Yeah I do. May I know your interests?
4326,"I love swimming, reading book, and writing poems. Actually I believe I am a good poet"
4326,Poetry takes a lot of skill. I love poetry too.
4326,What I love about poetry is that it enhances your power of imagination and observation too
4327,"Once you learn, no."
4327,I guess it probably requires a lot of practice to get the technique down.
4327,"Yes, a lot of failing and learning how to fix errors on the fly so the audience doesn"
4327,"Well as they say, practice makes perfect."
4327,"yeah, what hobbies do you have?"
4327,I enjoy volunteering with my local humane society
4327,That is really nice. A lot of animals are helped by humane societeis
4327,I totally agree. They help rescue animals.
4327,"Yes, I am glad they are at least in my area recieving a lot more help and recognition. "
4327,They also deal with injury and disorders for animals too.
4327,Ours doesn't do much veterinary care I guess. 
4327,Do you have any pets?
4327,"yes, 1"
4328,They almost seem human sometimes!
4328,i have to go hunting sometimes for work and so i think it's quite fun. what do you think?
4328,"I've never been hunting myself, except sometimes hunting for honeybees"
4328,oh that sounds fun. do you like collecting honey?
4328,"I do! I love honey, especially on peanut butter sandwiches, so it's very worth the work."
4328,"that sounds nice. i love veggies personally, all except for broccoli haha"
4328,Did you know that a lot of other veggies come from genetically engineering broccoli?
4328,really?? i had no idea
4328,"Actually even broccoli is engineered from kale. Cauliflower, broccoli, and Brussel sprouts are all manmade"
4328,i've never heard of any of this. i'll have to do more reserach
4328,I never knew until recently! It's especially funny that broccoli was made to make cabbage taste better
4328,wow that's amazing! 
4329,"Trump behaved like a bully then, but I admire him now"
4329,yeah a bully. How about that weather
4329,"I do not like it when it is cold, I love summers better"
4329,Its pretty hot year round where im from
4329,"You are lucky, here it is cold half the year"
4329,"nah, you can bundle up as much as you want but you can only take off so many layers"
4329,"What are your hobbies, I love to swim"
4329,Swimming is really fun. Im a bit of a fitness freak
4329,"Why is that, you should try it one day. I can teach you"
4329,but i said i like it?
4329,"Okay, That makes us a team"
4329,Sounds fun.
4330,Being a dad is very rewarding. I want to make sure she has the best life I can give her
4330,It's wonderful to hear a father fully engaging in their children's life! Is your child a boy or a girl?
4330,She's a girl. It would be fun to one day have a son too so he could play football like I did
4330,"That would be awesome! I remember how wonderful it was when my father engaged with me in sports, it's great bonding."
4330,With things getting more progressive though she may be able to play football when she gets older too! We do play catch
4330,Oh wow! Does she have a fondness of football?
4331,"Yeah, I never knew that. That's very interesting ."
4331,Do you that Usain Bolt is the world recorder for 100 meters?
4331,Yeah now I do know that. If you don't mind me asking where are you from?
4331,"I am from America, what about you?"
4331,Me too what part  are you from?
4331,"Midwest, MN to be exact, what are your interests"
4331,Cool I'm from the texas area. I love listening to music what about you?
4331,I really love reading books and writing poems
4331,me too I like reading too.
4331,"That is cool, we can make a good team I see"
4331,Yeah I guess so.  Do you like music?
4331,"I like music yeah, but classics mostly"
4332,So interesting! How is your sister?
4332,"She's wonderful. Always adventurous and supportive. I really look up to her. Now that she is married, we don't see eachother much."
4332,"Oh, I am so glad to hear that. Married already, wow! Time sure does float by -- sometimes too fast, for my taste! "
4332,I couldn't agree more. I don't think I will ever settle down. What about you?
4332,"I think so, yes. Here's a question for you -- would you rather have kids now or never? "
4332,"I would rather not birth a child, but consider adoption if I ever choose to start a family... in the distant future. ha "
4332,haha yes -- we are but high school students right now -- it's a little premature to discuss such things :)
4332,"Goodness, yea. Do you plan to attend a university after high school?"
4332,"Yes indeed, but only if I have enough money to cover the cost of tuition. You?"
4332,"I'm sure, if your grades are good enough, you can apply for grants. I never went to college, I got caught up singing for a band."
4332,Good idea. Good luck with everything going forward! Heading to sleep
4332,You too. Thanks for the chat.
4333,What other foods do you love
4333,I love rice and chicken a lot
4333,"Okay, that is nice. I love rice too. What about hobbies "
4333,I love to dance so much
4333,Dancing is not my thing to be honest. I love to listen to music and play some instruments
4333,"It is fun and healthy to dance, I can teach you if you like"
4333,"Wow, you are sweet. I'd love to for real. when are you free"
4333,During weekends mostly. you should also teach me how to play some instruments
4333,I will definitely do that. I play guitar and piano
4333,I will be looking forward to it. You seem like a nice person to hang out with
4333,Thanks for that. I hope we can be friends
4333,"I hope so, we should say bye now I guess"
4333,"Yeah, bye."
4334,Yes I love taking my dogs on hikes too. What kind do you have?
4334,"I have a mix between a corgi and chihuahua, I named him Elton. What kind of dogs do you have? "
4334,I have mostly pit bulls as I rescue them from the shelters I volunteer at. 
4334,Oh wow! That must be a very rewarding volunteer opportunity! What do you do while you're at the shelter?
4334,Mostly play with them. Do you volunteer? If not you should its very rewarding!
4334,I've been intending to. I haven't found anything fitting for me around my community. How did you sign up to volunteer?
4334,"Have you tried local rescues too? Just call around to your local shelters and ask about it, is what I did. "
4334,I never considered those! Is volunteering more like a job or do you have more freedoms?
4334,Do you have a lot of free time? Its usually very flexible and many need help all the time. 
4334,"I mostly only have time on the weekend, but even that varies. I can't make guarantees about attendance, which has always led me off from volunteering"
4334,Most are willing to work with you due to high demands. Have you thought about visiting local fundraisers to get more info on it? 
4334,Nope! I mostly browse stuff online. What are these fundraisers about?
4335,Huh! I didn't know that about the Celtics. What's another reason you like them so much?
4335,"They are the hometown team, been a big fan since I was 8"
4335,"Nice, nostalgia factor. Wish I could make it out to see them, but with my rent being raised tickets are a no-go."
4335,They will be good again
4335,No doubt! I'll keep an eye out for them on TV. So how have things been for you at home?
4335,I've been great.  I've been walking in the park recently and it's been nice
4335,"That's good to hear. And it's the time best time of year to be outdoors, in my opinion."
4335,yes. I love the outdoors.
4335,Fall weather's great for walks and hikes. Is your park nearby?
4335,just around my neighborhood. I love fall weather. What is your favorite season?
4335,"Fall's actually my favorite! Good weather, and all my favorite holidays happen then. How about you?"
4335,"Probably the spring.  I like it being warmer, though not having the holidays is a bummer."
4335,"I get that. At least you get Easter! It's been great talking to you, but I have to go. Hope to chat again some time!"
4335,You too! Thanks!
4336,"Bigger ones, do you love them?"
4336,"I don't have much experience with them, but I do enjoy the way they look. How about you?"
4336,"I really love them, what your hobbies and interests"

4337,"Great, now I want some strawberries.  You know what I would die for right now?  To be able to go skiing. "
4337,"I really like strawberries too. They are cultivated worldwide, so you can get them in a lot of areas. Do you pick your own?"
4337,I don't I wish I could.  I'm going to school for business right now so I rarely get the time between class and studying/
4337,I am planning to plant strawberries in most of my farm. 
4337,"That sounds exciting, do you enjoy farming?"
4337,"yes I love farming.I like breeding pets too, mostly cats and dogs."

4341,I also like wendy's. their fries are great
4342,"Yeah I did, it was such a painful experience for her"
4342,Oh no. I wonder if getting her some toys would help to distract her. I have a rubber band ball i could bring over?
4342,You think that could help? if so just bring it on
4342,"I think it might help, the rubber bands are made out of really premium rubber bands"
4342,"Okay, I will appreciate if you bring it over to me. What times are you normally free?"

4343,"Since the 1960s, my moped is hot pink, I've been looking into getting a new, more modern colored one."
4343,Oh mine is pink too. I've been in my motorcycle club since 1990 but i started riding when I was a young girl
4343,Is your club organized around a certain model of motorcycle or style of riding?
4343,Not really it's just a community thing 
4343,oh cool. I never been to any kind of motorcycle event
4343,they're very fun and you can learn a lot. what color do you want to get on your new bike
4343,It's orange. My childhood choice is this! It reminds me of my childhood. My bedroom walls were orange since it was and is my favorite color. 
4343,That's very interesting! Do you only have one bike or multiple
4343,I just have one. What about you?
4343,"I have five, two of them I got from my dad"
4343,"Oh man, your dad sounds awesome."
4344,"oh i see , why roses are specifically given to express love ?"

4344,"yes correct its is red rose that are used to express love ,indeed its is a beautiful flower"
4344,Indeed and many of the different breeds of roses have acquired major cultural significance in many societies. Do you have a favorite colored rose? Besides the common red one?

4345,"I will play her a song I think, I'm a musician"
4345,ok 
4345,"I'm pretty good, my parents used to be in politics but something changed and they got out and went a bit hippy dippy"
4345,I see. Were you a hippie?
4345,Were? I still am! lol
4345,"The girl is your wife, correct?"
4345,Not yet!
4345,"oh ok do you truely love her , will you be able to spend the entire time of your life with her ?"

4346,"No, he has no money. But sometimes I'll give him something to eat."
4346,What food do you give him?
4346,"A sandwich, or some candy. His favourite is Reeses Cups!"
4346,That's nice.  Hopefully his life will get better.
4346,I hope so too. He seems like a decent guy. Iwonder if there's anything else I could do to help. Maybe I should give him Q-tips...
4346,Yeah there could be something that would help him a lot.
4346,He says he loves music. Perhaps there's something in that.
4346,It could be hard for him to listen to music if he doesn't have a place to plug things in.
4346,I suppoes thats true. It must be a hard life.
4346,It would be nice if there were more resources to help homeless people.
4346,You're right. But where would the money to pay for them come from?
4346,It could come from a lot of different places if more people cared.
4347,my first one
4347,that's some great news . i am happy because i earned a bonus at work
4347,I thought you said you never did?
4347,just joking ya
4347,I'm gonna buy a new kayak
4347,"i got the bonus actually , kayak ? that is a great idea , i love adventure "
4347,I go on weekends 
4347,"great , where do you kayak usually ?"
4347,At Sale waterpark here in the uk
4347,"sale waterpark , great , i have never been there , is it safe ?"
4347,"It's very safe, beautiful too!"
4347,"great , i will love it so much"
4348,It was funny for then and embarrassing for me.
4348,Please tell me it wasn't one that smelt too bad!
4348,Not as bad as the smell that comes out of of my experimental dishes I prepare.
4349,approval news about skydiving
4349,Thats fantastic! I'd be so scared to do that but I bet it feels amazing. What an adrenaline rush. What did you have to do to be approved?
4349,"approval from my high command wife i took a lot of effort to convince her ,"
4349,Hahaha. I bet it did. Especially with the baby news. When is it due?
4349,baby news??  we already have two kids .
4349,Oh sorry. I guess I misunderstood you earlier. How old are your kids?
4349,2 and 3 years old both are girls
4349,Thats really lovely. Do they get on with each other?
4349,"yeah but not all time you know , they are kids hopefully they will get on when they grow up ."
4349,Im sure. They'll be sharing clothes and going to parties! I have a little boy. He's four in December.
4349,"ya sure , managing a single kid much easier than managing two ."
4349,"I bet thats true. We were thinking about trying for another one, but Im not sure I can manage the stress! Plus they're so expensive."
4350,But I am working for Discovery. It is nice to work for that channel.
4350,Discovery! That's so cool! You must be so proud to have achieved that. I would love that myself.
4350,My father wanted me to work for technology. So I've built my passion for creating and editing videos.
4350,"Wow! That sounds technical. I write poetry, guess some would say I'm a hopeless romantic but it pays the bills...just :)"
4350,Nice one! I have an ear for poetry. But work makes my life busy.
4350,"Creativity lets me wear my heart on my sleeve, guess you're the same? Following your passion?"
4350,"Following our passion, that is the most satisfying thing than any other thing in this world."
4350,"Yes, it doesn't feel like work then does it? What kind of videos do you create and edit?"
4350,I mostly work on science project videos and videos on nature and animals.
4350,That sounds amazing! Any big ambitions for the future?
4350,I want to make and release a video on our universe before the the Big Bang.That's my life ambition.
4350,I so hope you achieve that. It sounds like you're on the right path to do that.
4351,"oh , that is not cool . why do they think so"
4351,Its against the teachings of the church. This school is so stupid. What kind of school do you go to?
4351,"that is completely lame , you should always do what you feel good for you , "
4351,Exactly. We're not children any more. We can use our own judgement. I guess my fait his still important to me though. Maybe I should do what they say.
4351,its your choice after all but learn what will be good and make good difference to you and make your own decision
4351,"Thank you for that. Its good advice. So now that Ive spilled my soul, tell me about yourself!"
4351,spilled your soul yeah ;) that is so nice of you 
4351,:) I like to share!
4351,"that good that makes us friends , i studied in woodlands Methodist school in Houston"
4351,Oh thats cool! Ive never been to Houston. It must be much warmer than here. I went to Dallas once. Do you like it there?
4351,"yeah its definitely warmer that Dallas , but i got cool friends hear which is better."
4351,Are you still at school?
4352,"A little, but we live in different cities, so it wasn't too bad"
4352,so how would you guys meet for a date? would you both meet halfway or...?
4352,We usually meet halfway since we're two hours away from each other.
4352,"that doesn't sound too bad, the most I've traveled for a date has been 45-50mins"
4352,"We've been dating for three years, so the travel is worth it."
4353,I like to go to different conventions around the city.
4353,That sounds interesting. I usually like to attend tailgate parties.
4353,D
4353,I'm not sure I understand. What's your city like?
4353,"It's pretty big, lots of people. I always carry a weapon to feel safe."
4353,That sounds scary! I live in a pretty rural area. I would have moved to a more urban area for college if I could.
4353,What did you study in college?
4353,"I didn't attend college, unfortunately. It was only a dream; I had to stay here and help run the family farm."
4353,Farming is very important! I wish my family had a business I could be part of.
4353,That's admirable. Maybe you could start your own someday. You could pass it down to your kids.
4353,Maybe. Seems like it would be difficult. 
4353,"It might be a little difficult at first, but you could probably get the hang of it after putting in some work."
4354,Thanks. Do you want to have a pet like Jake?
4354,"hmmm... I'd pass on snakes I'd think about a dog so I could run with, I love playing football, running with a dog would be good"
4354,looks like you are very outdoorsy 
4354,"yea I've been trainning to run 2.5 kms in 11mins, I go hiking, go to the beach, me and my mates watch football. you got hobbies?"
4354,You can run 2.5 kms in 11 mins? That’s awesome!
4354,"not yet haha I can get close, 11mins .30seconds. I get so close but I can't beat that time just yet"
4355,Really?  I didn't know that.
4355,"Yeah, it's pretty crazy. I was going to attend a rugby game last week, but my car broke down."
4355,I hear you.  My car has an oil leak somewhere.
4355,That's awful! You should get that checked as soon as possible. Better late than sorry. 
4355,"True.  But it's a 2011 Passat, and I've been thinking of getting a hybrid instead."
4355,That's a pretty good choice. I wish I had purchased a more sustainable car so I wouldn't have missed a live event for my favorite sport.
4355,"I'm sorry you missed your event.   If I'd known, I would have driven you."
4355,That's very kind of you! What's your favorite sport?
4355,Tennis.
4355,"Tennis is great. I pretty much love all sports, but rugby is always my go-to."
4355,"Rugby is interesting, but I prefer to hit a ball, rather than another person! LOL!"
4355,"That's a big charm of it, though! I don't even think I could hit a ball in tennis if I tried."
4356,So what are you up to? I'm watching anime.
4356,I'm just enjoying breakfast at the moment. How's your day so far?
4356,"Pretty good. I had to go to the store to get more chocolate, that was fun."
4356,That seems very eventful. I had such a terrible headache yesterday that I called 911 for assitance!
4356,Oh no! Are you OK?
4356,"Yeah, I'm fine now! Thanks for asking. Worse things have happened!"
4356,That's good to hear. Hopefully it doesn't happen again.
4356,"So far so good. It's not as bad as not being able to write, though."
4356,What do you like to write about?
4356,"Unfortunately, nothing. I never learned how to write!"
4356,It's never too late to learn!
4356,"Yeah, that's true. Maybe I'll get it down someday."
4357,"True, that's why I love my huskies."
4357,Huskies live in Alaska don't they?
4357,"Not always.  They like colder climates, so they're perfect for Michigan."
4357,"Oh, I like kitty cats though."
4357,"Cats are OK, but you can't beat the loyalty of a husky.  And they're more snuggly than cats."
4357,"My friend Abigail has a bulldog, he's not very snuggly."
4357,I can imagine!   There's nothing like Husky fluff to keep you warm! LOL
4357,Does you dog like the snow?
4357,"I have two, and they both love the snow!  They would spend hours in it if I let them."
4357,"they're so fluffy , do you groom your husky ?"
4357,Constantly!   I spend about two hours brushing both of them three times a week.
4357,"Wow, that's a long time. I brush my cat but she usually runs away"
4358,do what online?
4358,Purchasing music. Which is your favourite u2 album? I like Joshua Tree.
4358,War an oldie but goodie.  Early U2 was the best! now they just need to retire lol.
4358,"Hahaha. Yeah, I know what you mean. Have you ever seen them live? "
4358,I have never seen them live.  I've seen live taped performances but of course in person likely better.
4358,"Yeah, Im the same. Its been a while since I've made it out to a gig. Once you have kids it becomes impossible!"
4358,So true!  I always want to catch a band live.  So tired now!  And it's been years since I even set foot in a club.
4358,I know. I feel so old! What kind of clubs did you used to like?
4358,Back in college I would go to raves lol along with just one local club.  Memories lol.  You?
4358,I was never that cool :) I was always more into disco and old school music. I did go to Ibiza for a summer though!
4358,Ooooh Ibiza! was it fun?
4358,From the little that I can remember! There was a lot of alcohol involved lol!
4358,lol!
4359,Yes they are usually very docile. I have to hire someone to care for them when I visit family.
4359,"They are wonderful dogs. I have two of them, and never once have they been aggressive or anything of the sort."
4359,Their behaviour is definitely affected by the person who raises and trains them
4359,"I agree, I dislike the labels that they attract.Finding someone to care for them whilst I am away on buiness is hard due to the prejudice against them"
4359,DO you travel for business often?
4359,"I do indeed. I guess that comes with the $200,00 paycheck, but, honestly, I'd rather spend more time with my puppies"
4359,Any family members around that could care for them?  My mom has an allergy to dogs so I can't get her to watch mine unfortunately.
4359,"Oh that must be horrible for her. I don't really have any family I am close to. What about yourself, are you close with your family?"
4359,"Yes I am, I have some living close to me but most of my family lives further away so I don't see them as much as I wish I could."
4359,That's a shame. Do they live overseas ?
4359,"No, just on the other side of the country but it's still expensive to fly and visit.  You must fly around a lot for business?"
4359,I do. Mostly international. The last trip I went on was great as the airport we flew with was pet friendly so my two pitbulls got to come with me
4360,Oh thats a shame. Its a great way to get some fun exercise. Do you do any sport?
4360,I like golf.  Form matters more than height in that sport.
4360,Ive just started that myself! Theres a great local public course near me. I lose a lot of balls.
4360,I used to lose balls also until I took a few lessons from one of the course pros.
4360,I think thats a good idea. Im learning from a friend but he's not a great techer. Do you have a handicap?
4360,Not a great one in my opinion; I've got a 5 handicap.
4360,Thats not bad! How often do you lay?
4360,"I try to get on the course at least once every couple of weeks, more if I can."
4360,I guess you have to put in the time to be any good. Hopefully I'll get there someday! I have a baby which takes up a lot of time!!
4360,"Oh, I know!  Kids take up a lot of time, even when they're not babies any more!"
4360,And there was me hoping it would get better! I love her but my god its an adjustment! Do you have kids?
4360,"I have two boys.  Yes, it is an adjustment, but does get better!!  "
4361,I guess it needs great discipline to do that.
4361,"i guess that's true for anything , hard work and discipline get results . you got any goals?"
4361,I have a few. like I want to loose some weight
4361,I've read alot of used books and one thing I've learned is its all about mindset. never let your setback be a failure
4361,that is inspiration right there. thanks
4361,"have you ever read the book mindset? highly reccomend, inexpensive and I applied alot of it to my everyday"
4361,I haven't read it but i will have to look for it
4361,what other goals do you have mate?
4361,I want to go back to college and complete  my degree.
4361,"hey good on'ya that's another really great goal! I admit studying isn't easy, what were you studying?"
4361,i am doing psychology. What about you?
4361,"wow psychology! I finished my degree in ministry, but haven't exactly landed a job out of it yet."
4362,I'm best at running long distances.
4362,Do you run in marathons? I prefer being i the kitchen myself.
4362,I've won a few marathons. Being very fast helps.
4362,Have you every run a race in Italy?
4362,"I haven't. It would be nice to go to Italy. I hear they have good coffee,"
4362,They do! I love Italy and love to speak their language
4362,Do you cook a lot of Italian food since you're in the Kitchen a lot?
4362,I do when i have the time for it! Do you have any favorites?
4362,I love pasta but don't eat it much with my runner diet. 
4362,Right! Italian food is delicious but not so great on the calorie intake for sure!
4362,I stick to things with caffeine to get my boost.
4362,I totally understand! Coffee helps me to function throughout the day!
4363,I am sure it is. where do you come from?
4363,I was born in VA. How about you?
4363,I was born and brought up in Paris.
4363,Cool.  Do you have a dream car?
4363,Not yet. I still use my mother's car
4363,Gotcha.  Do you work or go to school?
4363,I an in college.
4363,What are you studying?
4363,I am studying political science. it was my dream course. Do you go to school?
4363,No.  School was a long time ago for me.
4363,you are working?
4363,Yes.  I am a Realtor.
4364,I do.  I'm married with two boys.
4364,"Oh, I have two boys too. One grown up and one at school."
4364,My two are still young; both are in elementary school
4364,The drop - off and pickup routine can be tough. Do you work?
4364,I'm a client relations manager in a bank.
4364,"Wow, lots of responsibility! I couldn't do that - need more family time."
4364,"I'd love that, but we need the money I make from working full time."
4364,"I hear you! You don't get lost time back with the children, though. We like walking and chatting on the beach."
4364,"That sounds like fun!  When we have free time, we like hiking the trails in a local national park."
4364,"The exercise is good, isn't it? Especially if you spend a lot of time indoors working or gaming."
4364,Absolutely.  Sometimes I feel like I never move from my desk!  I'm glad the park is so close and so inexpensive
4364,"It's great that you have the free space. I'm so lucky we live on the coast, I used to walk for miles with my dad just chewing the fat."
4364,"We don't live on the coast, but there are a lot of beautiful mountains and national parks in the region."
4364,Which mountains? I'm near the Cairngorms in Scotland.
4364,"We're in Virginia in the U.S., so Shenandoah.  We have the Blue Ridge Mountains."
4365,You just have to embrace it.  Who is your favorite author?
4365,"Ursula Le Guin, Earthsea books are great fantasy for escaping the real world for a bit"
4366,Why do you think you lose too much?
4366,I never win and i play all the time! I am getting used to it
4366,What else do you like to do?
4366,I like mountain climbing whenever I am  free
4366,That's cool. Do you listen to music when you climb? I like metal music.
4366,Yes I like to listen to music when i climb
4366,What do you like the most about climbing?
4366,the challenges. it takes great sacrifice to do it
4366,I bet. What else do you like to do?
4366,I like dancing a lot. i have started attending classes for the sama
4366,Dancing is fun. I wish I could dance better while listening to metal music.
4366,practice all the time. you will be perfect.
4367,I was thinking that everyone else will be so ahead in life and I am just poor and uneducated enough to show up after 5 years
4367,"Trust me,  very few people have all their stuff together 5 years after graduation.  "
4367,"Yeah, after years I did realised that eventually but I was just so shy in that instance, what about you how yours went ?"
4367,"I didn't go to mine.  I couldn't get off work to travel.  In hindsight, I wish I made a better effort to go."
4368,Really?   I don't think I knew that.  
4368,Cool! What's your favorite thing about pancakes?
4368,"I actually like their versatility.  You can add different flavors and toppings, wrap a sausage in them."
4368,"I like the taste and texture of them, They are so sweet and delicious!"
4368,"Definitely!  I like different toppings, like hazelnut spread and bananas."
4368,"pancakes with tons of syrup is my favorite , i eat a lot of it."
4368,I like to mix it up.  We use lots of fruit and fruit syrup.
4368,I have never actually had one of those! We don't get very exotic fruits here in the midwest. What do they taste like?
4368,"Oh, we don't get too exotic.  We use a lot of blueberry and cherry syrup that we make ourselves."
4368,Blueberry sounds like it would be very tasty.
4368,"It is!   We have a blueberry patch, so we have them all summer long."
4368,I wish I could have a blueberry patch..
4369,I can never stay awake long enough to catch him.
4369,If only I could fall asleep!
4369,"We get up early, so we fall asleep early."
4369,"Jimmy Fallon is worth watching for me since I can't sleep, he is so funny!"
4369,He is!  I don't even know who is on late night TV anymore.
4369,I don't know either to be honest. (except Jimmy Fallon)
4369,"Him, maybe Conan.  That's all I know.   I don't even know what's on past 10:00pm"
4369,"Hmm, you are probably in a time zone behind me then."
4369,"Could be.  Also, we get up at 4:30am, so 10 is a late night.  lol."
4369,Makes Sense.
4369,We don't really stay up late unless it's football season.  Then we make the effort.  lol
4369,Oh now I see lol. Who's your favorite team?
4370,"I have seen kimodo dragons, they're amazing."
4370,"I know, it is almost like seeing a dinosaur.  Do you like lizards?"
4370,I live near the coast and we have lots of little ones scurrying around! How about you?
4370,No I live inland.  We mostly have small newts and salamanders. 
4370,How did you get into lizards? I got into bees because I noticed lots of different ones in the garden!
4370,When I was a kid the reptile house was my favorite exhibit.  Are you afraid about the disappearance of so many bee colonies? 
4370,"Very worried. If they disappear, ultimately so do we! It's easy for anyone to encourage them with a few plants, etc."
4371,My rescue dog. She's so scared of people.
4371,What kind of dog is she?
4371,I'm not sure. I got her from the shelter and they said she's just a mix of things. A regular Mutt.
4371,How often do you take her out for a walk?
4371,We go for walks every day. Do you have a dog you like to walk with?
4371,Yes my dog is called Rover and we go out in the forest for our walks.
4371,That's fun. What else do you like to do?
4371,I like to go cycling and running in the woods too.
4371,"I don't go to the woods much. As an only child, I never felt safe going there alone."
4371,Oh you should get down there. Maybe take a friend at first. It is great to get out in nature.
4371,I'll give it a try. Thanks for the idea.
4371,So what else do you like to do. Do you like to be in the city more?
4372,How is your job in a craft shop?
4372,I like it.  It's extra money doing something I enjoy
4372,Sounds great! What type of food do you like?
4372,"Oh, I like it all!    I love Japanese food especially, though."
4372,I like mexican food! It is the best in my opinion.
4372,"Mmmm, Mexican is good.   My local farmers market has the best tacos."
4372,What do youusually have inside tacos?
4372,"Chicken, if its from the market, but usually beef anywhere else."
4372,"Yeah, me too!"
4372,"I've had a few great fish tacos, also, but don't usually get those."
4372,"I like those as well, I guess I just really like tacos."
4372,What's not to like?   I also like huevos rancheros at a great local restaurant.
4373,Yeah I am not a big fan of salads in general
4373,I agree. I consider eating salads more of a chore.  
4373,I am always going to go for a nice big juicy steak rather than the salad counter.
4373,How do you like your steak cooked?
4373,I like medium rare. What kind of food do you like?
4373,I love 
4373,I didn't catch that - what kind of cuisine do you like?
4374,well i was planning to go with a friend but he got the flu so im going alone
4374,"Oh this is so bad, I wish I could come with you, where about do u live ?"
4374,"it would be great .I live at Dallas,texas. where u are from ?"
4374,"I live near south padre Island in texas, where about you will be riding ?"
4374,im thinking of canceling the trip because of the student exams i have to check 
4374,"Oh wow, studying is way more important than a horse riding you are absolutely right!"
4374,yeah. i teach math at the school .what u do ?
4374,"Wow, i thought for a second that you will be taking exams yourself haha! I am a warehouse worker"
4374,that great . that work must be hard to do 
4374,"Yes it is, but I like hard working it is great for me to keep active and fit!"
4374,u getting free exercise out of it lol. that great thinking 
4374,Haha! Yeah you have to think always positive! The best things in life are free!
4375,music or stone?! I live near mountains so there are some interesting looking rocks around
4375,"Either, I like both lol"
4375,me too. I like going to gigs with my friends. Have you heard or seen anyone good lately?
4375,"No, I have never actually been to a gig before."
4375,You're missing out! Why not?
4375,I like playing videogames more.
4375,"Ok, you got me there. I love that in rpg you can be anyone you can't be in real life"
4375,I like any games really.
4375,Got any favourites? 
4375,"Anything by Nintendo, CS:GO and anything competitive."
4375,"Nintendo always get it right, even my dad had a gamecube, it's a relic!"
4375,"I have a Nintendo Switch, I love it!"
4376,She let me walk for a bit then pointed at my trousers and started to laugh.
4376,"Oh, wow, I guess you were embarrassed? It happens to us all though, so you just laugh it off!"
4376,It was a bit embarrassing but it helped to break the ice so it was good in the end.
4376,So I guess the date went well?
4376,Yes we had a good time and she came back to my place for a coffee
4376,"Well, you don't want to date someone who doesn't like coffee anyway. :)"
4376,That's true - what's your favourite blend?
4376,The darker the better!
4376,"Ok, so have you been out on a blind date before?"
4376,I just turned 25 and single so my friend said they would set me up on one.
4376,So did you set out any types of person or look that you didn't want?
4376,Nothing too special. Just that I like blue eyes since it's my favorite color.
4377,"The top forty usually has quite nice songs, shame we can't sing them in the church choir"
4377,I don't go to church so I wouldn't know.
4378,"I didn't!!  It happened so quickly, and I was so surprised, I didn't even get a chance."
4378,That's a bummer.  Your just going to have to have another one so you can get it on video.
4378,Yes.  I'm going to glue my phone to my hand until I get a picture or video!
4378,"I know.  I a filmmaker, and always have my camera at the ready."
4378,"Ah, you have that instinct.  I should know to be prepared like that, but I forget to do it."
4378,Maybe not.  Sometime I think we experience life too much through the lens of out phones and not our eyes.
4378,"You make a good point.   I want my kids to have actual memories, rather than pics on a cloud."
4378,"If you want to make some of these memories special, take some pictures of your children with actual film.  I feel like you are more in the moment."
4378,Can you even get film anymore?  Or a camera that uses film?  I wouldn't know where to look for that!
4378,You can find both on line.  Try amazon.  You can even find instant cameras.  
4378,Great suggestion!  I should have thought; Amazon has everything.
4378,"Yes.  I think they will own the world in a few years, lol."
4378,"lol, probably"
4379,Summers are too hot here compared to where?
4379,"Im in tenessee, and is very hot and humid."
4379,Where I come from it snows most of the year.  I find the US temperatures relatively mild.  
4379,"Oh really, where u are coming from ?"
4379,I come from Russia.  Most of my family still live there. 
4379,"Wow this is amazing, how many languages do you speak? My passion is teaching, I teach English!"
4379,"I speak Russian, English, Polish, Ukrainian, Bulgarian and Czech.  When my relatives get together it sounds like a UN convention.  Do you teach English to adults or children?"
4380,Do you like going to concerts?
4380,I love going to concerts but I can't always find someone who likes the same music.
4380,I usually go with my friends because then it's a good time even if I don't like the music!
4380,So what kind of music do you like?
4380,I like pop music
4380,So who is your favourite pop star. I like Ariana Grande.
4380,I like Taylor Swift!
4380,I went to see Taylore Swift in concert last year. She was amazing and it was a big production.
4380,"Yeah, Taylor Swift is great."
4380,So have you got a holiday booked this summer. I love travelling especially back home to Russia.
4380,I like Russia too! I have been to Moscow.
4380,Oh great - what did you see while you were there?
4381,I am a baseball player
4381,I love baseball.  The have better snacks than every other sport.
4381,It's wonderful! I make good money too.
4381,I love to work!
4381,I love my job as well.
4381,That's awesome! What do you do?
4381,"Yet again, I play baseball."
4381,"Oh sorry, i forgot. How long have you played for?"
4381,Around 2 years.
4381,"Thats good, i dont have enough free time to play sports "
4381,"Well that's a shame, It's good fun!"
4381,"Yeah, i work too many hours a week to have any free time"
4382,"I can draw basic things.  My son, though, is an excellent artist."
4382,My son is a pretty good artist if i do say so myself and he gets that from me.
4382,"My son doesn't get it from me, lol.  He does amazing things with his pencils, almost photorealistic"
4382,"Interesting. I have always preferred crayons, which are non toxic and safe for children. "
4382,My son  has a definite preference for pencils.  He used crayons when he was younger.
4382,"Well, do you have a brand that works the best?"
4382,"He likes the expensive ones, Prisamacolor, but will work with Faber."
4382,They sell them in mild too! Where can I get one?
4382,I think you can get them in any craft store.
4382,"I get a lot of my supplies at Walmart or sometimes Sam's Club, but I will make a point to check out craft stores."
4382,"Michael's has a good selection.  A bit pricier, but more selection."
4382,I'll have to check it out!
4383,i love quilting as i feel closer to her
4383,That's great.  I think it's important to find connections like that. 
4383,im also sorry you lost your grandparents where you close?
4383,"Yeah.  They were great people.  Older people are so much more down to earth, and have great perspective on life. "
4383,i love my grandchildren as i hope we continue our bond like i had with my grandmother. 
4383,You can.  If I learned anything form my grandparents is to be a good listener.  
4383,that is very ture!  sounds like you had amazing grandparemnts
4383,They were.  But I still have memories of them.
4383,thats the best thing in life. we can always keep our memories. thats why i love to quilt and pass them to my grandchildren
4383,How many grandchildren do you have.  
4383,4 and one on the way. do you have any?
4383,"No.  I don't have any children, and don't see any in the future."
4384,It sure was!
4384,How long ago did you graduate from high school?
4384,Around 3 months ago now but it feels like just yesterday.
4384,What did you graduate in? I studied writing.
4384,Maths
4384,Are you a math major?
4384,Yes I am!
4384,Really?  You got the best grades in your class?
4384,"Yes, My friends said I was really smart."
4384,Well done! What are your next plans?
4384,Possibly work at Nasa with my boyfriend.
4384,"That sounds fun, do you do any other activities? I do Yoga, is that something you've ever tried."
4385,"just his bike, I think! But the mom did nothing - I had to go over and help"
4385,That is so caring of you! You are a good person!
4385,"Not really, just a good mom. Would you intervene in a similar situation?"
4385,"Of course I will, as I did many times, but not everyone is like me and you! What is your occupation ?"
4385,I'm a nurse. More of a vocation than a job!
4385,"This is cool! This proofs that you are a good person, I love psychoanalyzing my friends what is something that you love ?"
4385,Not sure I'd enjoy being analyzed - I can't even analyze myself. I love curling up with a good book. Do you read much?
4385,"I can not say I read much 3 days out of 7 I will have a read, but not everyday and all the time, not obsessed with reading lol"
4385,It's not compulsory! I find it relaxing though. How do you chill out?
4386,School is doing great but I have been facing a few challenges.
4386,What kind of challenges. 
4386,A few debts here and there.
4386,Oh.  Do you have anyone who can help guide through how to paying it off.
4386,"Not really but I have been venturing into some hobby, or could you help?"
4386,Believe it or not the best way to pay off debt is to save.  
4386,"That is why am working my hobby of being a DJ, mostly with electronic music. What do you think?"
4386,"Not much of a club person, but if you like it and you can a bit of extra cash, then go for it."
4386,Do you like any music yourself?
4386,I love music.  Unfortunately I have zero talent in creating it. 
4386,Being a fan is also one way of supporting the culture.
4386,I agree.  I am so lucky to live in an area where there is so much access to different types of art and culture. 
4387,Such a cool gift! I got a mug with dragons on it.
4387,For graduation or for something else?
4387,"Yeah, graduation, but it was from my partner so it's sentimental. You got anything you wouldn't part with?"
4387,I can't think of anything material that I couldn't give up. I don't really place much value in things.
4387,That sounds very Zen. What is valuable to you?
4387,I guess family and friends. Everything else is replaceable.
4387,True enough. Do you have any pets - I just love animals
4387,"Nope. Never had one. They seem like they'd be a ton of work and I'm busy enough, you know?"
4387,That's actually really thoughtful. Too many people have pets but neglect them 'cos they don't have time. What's your job?
4388,Do you get to go riding much? i use to before my best friend moved away. she lived on a ranch.
4388,I love riding but haven't been for a long time
4389,Karate and Tae Kwon Do - it's really good exercise too!
4389,That's great that you are learning a martial art and blowing off steam at the same time!
4389,"Yeah, what do you do to let off steam or relax?"
4389,I'm a big fan of running. I find it clears my head really well. 
4389,Have you got somewhere nice nearby to run? I'm in the city so it's difficult
4389,Have you tried the local park? If you go early morning when it's light it's quiet and quite nice. 
4389,Too busy feeding and fussing my cat in the morning before work! How far do you run?
4389,"I don't really measure distance, I just put on an audiobook and run for about 30mins or so. "
4389,That's cool. What are you listening to?
4389,I'm trying to work my way through Game Of Thrones at the moment. Not sure if I like it yet. 
4389,"I've seen it all, but it would take ages to read! Really enjoyed it all the way through"
4389,"Hahaha, that's why audiobooks are good - you can listen to them when walking or driving! I haven't seen the series yet, want to read it first."
4390,"Yeah, I guess having it there just makes it more convenient. "
4390,So what are you watching on TV right now?
4390,I'm watching Peaky Blinders.
4390,I love peaky blinders but it is very violent sometimes.
4390,Yeah I'm a big fan. I suppose it's pretty violent but it's also clearly adult television.
4390,So do you like any other British TV programmes?
4390,"Yes. I'm a big fan of Top Gear, a very interesting car show. You?"
4390,Top Gear is good - do you like the new presenters or prefer Jeremy Clarkson and friends?
4391,Perhaps for people like that gambling is best avoided altogether.
4391,time is our gambling partner on the other side of the table and it holds all the cards of the deck in its hand
4391,Do you like to gamble?
4391,"there is too much of a risk, and I avoid risk ( esp gambling)"
4391,Yes I would agree. I only do it once or twice a year for fun.
4391,"Everything's a gamble, love most of all"
4391,Do you like to gamble with love? It is a losing game
4391,"chance is a flip of the card or a toss of the coin,,, we live to test the waters  "
4391,Perhaps it is better to experience it than not
4391,"It's hard to walk away from a winning streak, even harder to leave the table when you're on a losing one."
4391,I once lost a lot of money here in france
4391,were you at the casino in Monaco ?  Ive been there and its wonderful
4392,Yes I have a cat called Minnie.
4392,Oh what kind of cat is she?
4392,Some kind of cross between a tabby and a ginger cat!
4392,Oh! My mom had a tabby cat. They are very pretty.
4392,"Yes, although she keep bringing in mice at the moment which is not so nice!"
4392,It's always funny to see that hunter instinct in cats.
4392,Not so funny when you are chasing a tiny mouse around your living room...
4392,That's fair. My mom's cat always killed the mice before bringing them in so we didn't have that problem.
4392,Do you like listening to music. I love the rolling stones.
4392,"Yeah I kind of listen to everything. Modern pop, hip-hop, alternative, etc. The Rolling Stones are a bit before my time."
4392,"Yeah they are before mine too, but my dad was a big fan so I have always liked them."
4392,Parents have a big influence on music choice. I'm a big Michael Jackson fan for that reason.
4393,"Good things too, though. Did you never have an imaginary friend?"
4393,i still have an imaginary friend lol
4393,"That's awesome, tell me about him / her"
4393,He is a friend i have for sometime now. i love knowing he is there for me.1
4393,Sounds like you deserve someone real who can be like that! For me it's my dog Daeshin
4393,Aww i love his name. i really need to get out more
4393,Have you got anywhere nice nearby for walks?
4393,Go to a walking path or park. Maybe to a dog park also.
4393,"My dog, like a friend, is good to talk to. He loves swimming at the coast"
4393,my mom lives with me we go on walks nightly
4393,"That's nice, you must get to talk and have a good relationship"
4393,Most definetly she knows when I need her support and she takes the role as 
4394,"Yeah, so was my wardrobe lol"
4394,Lol. Was the bag full?
4394,It was...oh how I regret that. 
4394,Well you live and you learn i guess
4394,That's what I get for using those cheap twist ties.
4394,yea - you could always double bag the rest of them
4394,"The kids suggested that I should, but I didn't want to waist another bag just going a few feet outside."
4394,For sure I relate. Next time you could take out the whole bin ;)
4394,"Next time, the hubby will take all risks. I'm not touching another garbage bag unless I'm lining the can."
4394,Haha that's the way to do it! 
4394,"He' swears by some unknown law it's a ""man's job"" so he can consider himself promoted."
4394,"And if he complains, just remind him of that :)"
4395,"Hi, how are you?"
4395,"I am doing well, and you?"
4395,Well also.  Do you have any children?
4395,"Yes, I have 2. How about you?"
4395,I have 3 daughters
4395,Nice. I have 1 son and 1 daughter. How old are your girls?
4395,"3, 5, 7"
4395,My son is 7 and daughter is 9
4395,Cool.  Do they do any activities? I love horseback riding.
4395,"I did ballet when I was younger and have put my daughter in it. I might put my son in music classes, I'm not sure yet"
4395,Do they do any sports?
4395,"Yes, I take them to swimming lessons as well. How about your children?"
4396,"Nice, I will have to check him out"
4396,He also writes his own songs
4396,"Thats impressive, I've been trying to write some of my own songs recently"
4396,That's very cool. What are they about?
4396,"They are instrumental at the moment, I struggle to write lyrics"
4396,What genre? Maybe I can help.
4396,That would be great thanks. I'm going for a soulful sound
4396,Who is your inspiration?
4396,Stevie wonder mainly
4396,I love him! Named my dog Steve after him. He is blind
4396,That's awesome! What type of dog is he?
4396,"Pit mix. He was a stray, so I'm not really sure."
4397,"I am in Spain at the moment, the closest person is in the UK"
4397,Where does your mother live? There might be a check-in that someone nearby could do.
4397,"My mother lives in England, i could ask my cousin if she would visit"
4397,That's a great idea.
4397,"yeah it would be best, i would fly over but i am a bit busy"
4397,"Yeah, I get that. You can't just drop everything at every sign of issues."
4397,"no exactly, i am starting to write my vegetarian book so time is limited "
4397,Oh are you a vegetarian? I've thought about going vegan.
4397,"Yeah it defiantly worth it, i have so much energy!"
4397,"That was my main worry, that it would be hard to get enough nutrients without animal products."
4397,"Yeah it can be tough, but if you plan your meals its okay"
4397,I'm a big fan of meal planning so that should work.
4398,Oh you need to try it.  People get so stuck on cow milk for ice cream. There's so much more out there.
4398,I'll have to give it a go. I am sure I will like it. Are you very health-conscious then?
4398,Not exactly.  I explore health conscious options because they are so under-explored.  There's flavors and tastes you ignore by avoiding it.
4398,I guess if you are eating ice cream you can't be too worried about calories!
4398,"True, but when you set your mindset right you don't have to. Eating normal ice cream isn't the problem: it's when that's all you eat."
4398,"Everything in moderation, well apart from watching Friends."
4398,"Exactly.  I have a policy: if I want to be healthier, ADD, don't subtract. Add a vegetable. Add a different snack instead of the same M&Ms.  "
4398,"I only eat the blue M&Ms, they are the healthiest ones."
4398," Well next time you want a snack, eat something else blue. Each time. Within a week you'll find yourself eating eggplant and boom, healthy."
4398,"I can't think of many blue foods, so I would most definitely lose some weight."
4398,"Well nature doesn't do blue a lot so it's more purple/burgundy. So that'll give you some ammo.  From there, go international, then odd.. "
4398,Well all this talk about food is making me hungry - might have to find that coconut ice cream in the store.
4399,Thats very interesting! do you have any food allergies?
4399,I don't have any food allergies do you? I love to grow my own herbs and veggies in my garden.
4400,"Oh totally, we went for at least three months. I can't believe I won!!"
4400,How wonderful. Please tell me more about the experience.
4400,"We did streamers in the gym and a dance, it was fun!"
4400,That is very cool.  Dances are so much fun. Do you like to dance?
4400,"Oh yeah, Tay Tay is the best. What is your favorite type of music?"
4400,"I like all kinds of music.  But my favorites are R&B, old school hip hop and the Blues. "
4400,"My Mom likes that stuff too, have you ever run for anything at school? It was really tough to win"
4400,"No, I never ran for anything in school. But I do like running itself."
4400,"Running is fun, I like to do volleyball but my mom can't always take me because she has to work. How did you start running?"
4400,I started running as a way to exercise. But after awhile it became one of my favorite things to do.  What other hobbies do you have?
4400,"My BF likes baseball so I like to watch him, and also fortnite is cool. I also like to draw a bit "
4400,That's interesting.  I also like to draw.  It happens that I work in a museum.  
4401,"I wish I could be tell you which part, but my sense of direction is awful. "
4401,"i've only been there once when i lived in virginia , i really liked it ."
4401,I just moved out here. I have to get out more to explore the country side.
4401,"The mountains are gorgeous, especially in  the Fall when the colors change."
4401,I know. I'm from a small town and love the peacefulness of the country setting.
4401,I love camping in the State parks. 
4401,My husband is a camper. He swears I will love it. I told him once we've settled I we will have our first official outdoor camping.
4401,Nothing smells better than food cooking over a campfire.
4401,"He teases my senses with the grilling on weekends. He always say ""Imagine all this happening outside this backyard""."
4401,He is correct in his assessment. Camping is an unforgettable experience.
4401,I hope I love it as much as he does. 
4401,"Not only is it addicting, but it soothes your soul to be in sync with nature."
4402,"it became quite popular, everyone wanted one"
4402,Well I still love animals and I am hoping to study to become a vet when I am older.
4402,"oh really, that exciting! my family have a small restaurant so i hope to work there"
4402,That's cool - what kind of restaurant is it?
4402,"Its a Indian restaurant, i would work there now but i volunteer at a soup kitchen  "
4402,You'll have to tell me where it is - I love a spicy curry.
4402,"Its in London, its only small at the moment "
4402,"Well, I am sure it will do well, curry is the favourite food for the Brits."
4402,yeah that is very true! 
4402,So what is your favourite kind of curry. I like a Chicken Dhansak.
4402,"My favourite is a chicken madras, with a poppadom "
4402,Currys are great. I really enjoy Thai food too.
4403,I think someone hit it with their door in a parking lot.  Thank goodness I have a lot of cars to use while the door is fixed.
4403,oh wow I would have been upset about that. what do you like to do for fun? I run 2 miles everyday.
4403,"Awesome, I wish I had your dedication.  I am really into watching sports."
4403,"I love sports, i played football in college "
4403,Where did you go?  I love college football.
4403,I went to Virginia Tech where did you go?
4403,"I went to a small DII school in the Midwest, but didn't play.  Do you still follow the Hokies?"
4403,"I do still watch from time to time, I love football. Who's your favorite NFL team?"
4403,"Me too.  I really like the Oakland Raiders, what about you?"
4403,I love Dallas Cowboys 
4403,America's Team.  Half the country agrees and the other half vehemently disagrees! 
4403,I also really like Carolina Panthers 
4404,Dreams are what fuel our lives. Always strive for them.
4404,I always try to be an optimistic person. Have you reached a dream you can share?
4404,"Yes, I wanted to get out of a boring job. I took classes and now have a fantastic job!"
4404,Good for you! I wanted to be a firefighter but I'm too short. That's something I can't change.
4404,"No, but is there something you can do related to the profession? Think outside the box."
4404,I do volunteer at my local station. It feels good to help out even in small ways. 
4404,That is great and I know you are a valuable asset.
4404,Thank you. Do you volunteer anywhere?
4404,"Yes, I volunteer for an organization called ShowerUp. It gives homeless people a chance for showers once a week."
4404,I love that idea. It feels good to help others for sure. My family volunteers with me. It's good for the kids.
4404,There are so many unfortunate people in the world and I help because I could find myself in the situation someday.
4404,"""There but for the grace of God"" I agree. Do you like movies?"
4405,How interesting.  My kids love tomatoes. But I don't care for them.
4405,"I enjoy them as toppings. Even better, the fried green tomatoe."
4405,I've never tried fried green tomatoes.  My favorite fruit is blueberries.
4405,I've had them once. My husband fried them. I absolutely loved it.
4405,That sounds nice. Does your husband cook frequently? Mine doesn't cook at all.
4405,Oh yes! He's from the south and will cook up a ton of spicy southern food.
4405,I like spicy food a lot! Pretty much anything with a kick to it makes me happy.
4405,I agree. I can't get enough of the sauce he makes. I think he puts the whole red pepper in it. It's so flavorful with a nice kick.
4405,How ironic.  I grow a variety of peppers and make hot sauce every year!  
4405,That saves on going to the store for it. 
4405,"Indeed. And, it is also tastier. "
4405,"Yes, it's not enough variety in hot sauce on the market anyway."
4406,No
4406,Do you play in a band?
4406,"No, I just play solo because I'm shy about it."
4406,"I am a guitar teacher, so I get lots of people who want to play in bands."
4406,Oh ok. I'd love to learn the guitar but it's so much more difficult than a keyboard.
4406,Well if you have a good teacher and you practice then it is not too bad.
4406,I'm a teacher too but I teach yoga
4406,I have never tried Yoga but I would like to. What's your best advice fo beginners?
4406,practice a lot. even just 15 minutes a day helps
4406,Do you offer a beginner's class. I would be intimidated if everyone was an expert already.
4406,Yes.
4406,That's good - it must be good for your flexibility. Does it help you lose weight?
4407,I was going to the shops to grab ingredients for spaghetti and meatballs and someone wanted me to drive faster
4407,I'm glad you're okay. What happened?
4407,I was driving the speed limit and they were right behind my car trying to overtake 
4407,I get so irritated by that. I've had to get creative to find coping strategies. How did you handle it?
4407,"I just drove slower to irritate them more, then when i got the chance pull over "
4407,"I've done that.  I ussually just remind myself to be grateful that I'm not an idiot driver like that, or married to one."
4407,"Yeah that is true, it does make you anxious when people drive like that"
4407,"Sometimes I let them pass but make a point of smiling and waving as the go by, just to not take the bait of appearing annoyed."
4407,Yeah just be kind that all you can do
4407,Kindness is the one thing some would say you are not going to regret in the end.
4407,yeah you cant go wrong with being kind 
4407,I try to live by The Golden Rule
4408,That's exactly how I do is wait till the last minute then cram study so bad
4408,I keep telling myself I'll start earlier but rarely do. Good luck! Do you have a pet?
4408,I do I have 4 dogs and a cat. I love kittens. Do you have any pets?
4408,Wow that's a lot. Yes I have a dog named Bob. He loves the outdoors. We go fishing together.
4408,"All my dogs are little, I have a yorkie, a chihuahua, a toy poodle and a toy poodle mix. "
4408,Bob is a terrier mix about 10 lbs. I love little lap dogs!
4408,"awww how sweet, I also love little dogs they're so sweet. My dogs are. Topher, Andi, Ayden and Punzie."
4408,What great names! Do you have any hobbies?
4408,"I do I like to run, I usually run a couple miles everyday. What kind of hobbies do you like?"
4408,Well like I say I fish but I also like to ski when I get a chance. Love the outdoors!
4408,I used to go fishing all the time with my dad when I was younger it was so much fun
4408,I love the solitude. It's almost a meditation for me. 
4409,Yes. I have 3 children and 2 grandchildren.  Do you have any kids?
4409,"Yes, they are all adults. "
4409,Mine too.  But sometimes I miss them being small.  Do your children live near you?
4409,"Yes, 2 of them do and the other 3 lives out of state."
4409,All 3 of mine live near me.  I am not sure how I would feel if one of them lived out of state.  
4409,I think the 2 boys wanted to be near me since the divorce. Feeling like protectors or something.
4409,I see. That probably is a typical boy thing.  Its nice to know they love you like that.
4409,"Yeah, the girls call often enough where I believe they are like little owls watching me too lol."
4409,It is interesting how children change when they become adults. Almost like they become the parent.  What do you do in your spare time?
4409,"I love to draw. I've been working on a piece for weeks, but I can't finish it until I find my glasses."
4409,I also love to draw!  Hopefully you are able to find your glasses soon.  I also like to go out and people watch.
4409,People watch? Didn't know that was a hobby lol.
4410,That is all true but she is an icon of a former generation of music.
4410,"maybe, but her music is too repetitive now"
4410,I do agree about that. Most music is repetitive though. I love the bands from the generation of the 60's and 70's.
4410,"I agree, some songs no matter how old or repetitive, are always good to hear"
4410,The thing that amazes me is that the band members are old and still performing.
4410,"So true, a talented artist is not a one time wonder, they always come up with new material"
4410,I don't believe this generation has put out the kind of unique music that will be remembered in the future.
4410,"I agree, the older musicians were the true trend setters "
4410,I can hear certain songs and remember where I was and  who I was with.
4410,Wow that's so true. Songs do bring back a lot of memories 
4410,It is said that music is the heart of the soul and I agree with that.
4410,"Surely it is, it transports you to places you don't think about a lot"
4410,thanks for a great chat.
4411,I did actually
4411,Congratulations on the promotion!  Job well done!
4411,Thank you.  How have you been?
4411,I have been great!  The weather has cooled off so I've enjoyed that! It makes it easier to be more active
4412,What kind of work do you do?The weather here is so very cold but we do have beautiful springs.
4412,"I am a youtuber, i enjoy watching and playing games"
4412,Awesome that sounds like a lot of fun. What kind of games do you play? I love watching people play minecraft on twitch
4412,"Anything i can play with others, i particularly like battlefield  "
4412,sounds like a lot of fun. I'm from Colorado where are you from
4412,I am from London 
4412,very cool one of the streamers I watch is from there. 
4412,"Oh thats really cool, it is very popular now "
4412,IT is and it's so much fun to watch streamers. I need to start watching some on youtube I hear it's awesome as well
4412,Yeah it is so much easier to watch it on there and putting up your own streaming videos is easy
4412,very cool
4412,Yeah it is easy and great fun
4413,Yes! I would love to be a world traveler but this is the next best thing.
4413,I also enjoy traveling and trying new foods.
4413,Do you have a favorite? Mine are Indian and Thai. Where have you traveled?
4413,I like to make fresh pico de gallo like I learned to do in Mexico 
4413,"I've only been to Tijuana many years ago and we weren't eating, ha! I love France."
4413,"I love France also, I spent three weeks there. Got a rabbit from the butcher"
4413,Oh my that is really going local! When I visited it was so hot! When I go back it will be later in the year for sure.
4413,"I was there in the springtime, I'd like to visit in the summer or fall next time"
4413,"I had the best time. Walked all over the city, in and out of cafes, museums even cemeteries!"
4413,Me too. We got 5-day museum passes in Paris and saw as many as we could.
4413,That was a smart thing to do! I went to Lyon for the Bocuse baking competition. Unreal!
4413,"So, you are really into baking?"
4413,No the person I was with was but so glad to have experienced that.
4414,I hope so too! I'm hoping it will entertain them for a while 
4414,That is wonderful.  I am sure they will enjoy it.  I have a dog. She definitely finds ways to entertain herself.  Usually it involves chasing squirrels.
4414,That's cute! hopefully she doesn't eat them 
4414,Oh no.  She never catches them. They are too fast for her. Do you cook?
4414,Yes I love to cook! my family loves the food I make. how about you?
4414,I am not a great cook.  It is not unusual for me to eat out several times a week. 
4414,That must be very expensive
4414,I suppose. But time is money. So it balances out.
4414,"That's true, would you like to become a better cook?"
4414,Not really.  I would rather spend my time being out and about with my friends. Do you have any hobbies?
4414,I can understand that. I love playing piano how about you?
4414,That's interesting.  I have always wanted to play an instrument.  
4415,Witnessed a roll-over accident.
4415,"I'm sorry to hear that! Did your vehicle collide with another vehicle, a pedestrian, or road debris?"
4415,"It wasn't me. A couple was cut off by a drunk driver, It was horrible. The news crew was there and everything."
4415,That is terrible how are you feeling
4415,The driver was in a coma and the passenger had a few broken bones. I'm so glad I don't drink. 
4415,Well at least no one got killed.
4415,"I pray the driver comes out of the coma. If he dies, that's a manslaughter charge."
4415,all you can do now is pray 
4415,"The reported the driver was 85, now that is terrible. I will pray for him."
4415,I will pray too. Wow 85 thats crazy
4415,"Yep, the wife said they were heading to a football game."
4415,thats so sad. It was supposed to be a fun time turned terrible.
4416,"oh really, i love dogs! "
4416,"me too dogs are awesome. My little sister loves dogs as well, she has a toy poodle"
4416,"Oh thats really cute! my dad was a policeman but he was killed, but the police dogs were really nice"
4416,oh i'm so sorry to hear he was killed thats so sad.
4416,Yeah it is really heartbreaking but he was an amazing person 
4416,"that's great, the police are such kind helping souls. "
4416,"yeah they really are, they are really brave"
4416,yes they put their lives on the line everyday to keep us and our families safe.
4416,"yeah they really do, it must be rewarding to help people "
4416,I think that would be very rewarding to know you were helping folks everyday 
4416,"yeah it would be, much better than any other career "
4416,Ive always wanted to be an FBI agent 
4417,"I know, it's so much nicer than having to go out and waste time in the store, who has time for that these days!"
4417,I hate going to the grocery store. Online shopping is so convenient!
4417,"Right? Especially because I live in the middle of nowhere basically, the nearest store is like a 30 minute drive, yuck."
4417,Is the delivery fee expensive since you are so far from a store?
4417,Well yes but I think it's worth it. I need to conserve my energy to help my growing baby. Only 3 months left until the big day.
4417,Oh wow!  Congratulations! Do you know if you are having a boy or a girl?
4417,"It's going to be a boy, and we're going to name him Zacharius. My parents think the name is silly, but I love it!"
4417,"Who cares what anyone else thinks as long as you love it.  I am a dog mom.  3 dogs and a parrot.  They are my ""children."""
4417,Oh that's wonderful I love dogs. What breeds are they?
4417,Boxers.  That is my favorite breed. 
4417,"Ooh a very powerful breed, good choice!"
4417,Thank you!  They are such sweet boys.
4418,My favourite was Snake Eater where it was set in the junger
4418,"yeah , they are great fps games ."
4418,What console do you play on?
4418,I have a gaming rig
4418,"That's cool, I play on my mac sometimes"
4418,"Cool, when did you get it?"
4418,around 2 years ago. it is for making music too
4419,I admire her versatility as an actress
4419,"Not only that, but she is very talented and believable in the  roles."
4419,Yes!  I wonder if she has any input for her wardrobe etc.  She always looks accurate for the time period of her characters.
4419,I am sure she does since most movies have a wardrobe area with costumes.
4419,Her hair always looks wonderful!  I could only dream of having hair like that!
4419,"Yes, it is although it is actually a dark brown color."
4419,"Lucy was one of my favorites that she starred in.  She digitized herself, hair included, in the end lol"
4419,"I did not know that. Speaking of trivia, did you know she has a twin brother?"
4419,I did not know that.  Is his hair as magnificent as hers?  
4419,"Yes, it is. He did not go into acting though. He worked for the Obama campaign and was a former spouse of  Ryan Reynolds."
4419,Are you sure it wasn't Scarlett that was a spouse of Ryan Reynolds?
4419,Maybe I read the bio incorrectly. Thanks for pointing that out.
4420,I am retired and complete the hits for fun
4420,Nice!  Do you have any hobbies you enjoy?
4420,reading and fishing are my primary hobbies.  Do you have any hobbies?
4420,"I actually love to read, too.  I also like writing short stories."
4420,"Good, I am not much of a writer but I try on occasion.  Do you have any other hobbies?"
4420,I also like going to the movies.  My wife and I like to keep up with the potential Oscars race.
4420,"Nice, what have you seen lately?"
4420,We recently went to see Judy that has Renee Zellweger playing Judy Garland in a biopic.
4421,they said i had to replace it 
4421,Why do you have to pay to replace it?  Doesn't the city own the meter?
4421,"Im not really sure, i will be graduating in september so i am low on money"
4421,I know how that is.  What are you going to do about the meter? 
4421,I will phone them and ask for details on why it might be broken
4421,That's a great idea.  Where are you from? Do you speak any languages besides English?
4421,"Not really, some Spanish but nothing extreme. I am from London. Where are you from?"
4421,I am from Puerto Rico.  So I am fluent in both English and Spanish. 
4421,Oh wow thats quite impressive 
4421,Thank you!  What is your major?
4421,Physics 
4421,What career path do you plan to take once you graduate?
4422,"Don't worry, I do that all the time when I'm at the bar."
4422,Well it helps to eavesdrop and listen in without their knowledge
4422,"Absolutely, I find it hilarious when things are going wrong between two people."
4422,Sometimes I struggle to not laugh at people
4422,Same here. Where is your favorite place to people watch?
4422,I like it in bars. what about you?
4422,Same here! What type of bars do you like to visit? My favorite are the dirty dive bars.
4422,"yes me too, i like places with a good mixture of people"
4422,What state are you in?
4422,Michigan. You?
4422,"Georgia, the weather is just starting to cool off"
4422,Georgia is pretty hot right? Hot summers and cold winters there?\
4423,"I've never heard of that person, perhaps I should do more research. I have a long time to think about it."
4423,How many kids do you have?
4423,"I don't have any, I'm still in high school!"
4423,"Oh, I see.  Do you hope to start a family someday?"
4423,"Oh jeez I don't know, that feels like a lot of responsibility. I can barely take care of my new braces as it is."
4423,"Well we live in a day and age where you don't have to, you don't owe the world any children."
4423,"You sound wise, perhaps you could give me some life lessons as an older(?) person?"
4423,"I like to suggest that people consider the possibility that they may have lived ""other lifetimes""..."
4423,"Do you mean like reincarnation and stuff? That sounds pretty rad, tell me more!"
4423,"Yeah, like that.  I bet most women now had other lives where they had no choice but to get married and have children"
4423,"Woah I've never even thought of such things, I feel a bit enlightened right now."
4423,"What if you came back to do something else with your life, besides parenting?"
4424,"It would. I would buy a ""cheaper house"" and a little something for my 2 dogs too."
4424,I would build a house.
4424,Definitely can't go wrong with that.
4424,What else would you do if you got some money like that?
4424,Would love to buy another car.
4424,I would buy things I needed like house car that kinda stuff and then try to save some lol 
4424,I need more pots and pans too. 
4424,I hear you! All of my silverware has disappeared. I have like 2 spoons left 
4424,Lol. I know the feeling. My kids can't believe I haven't upgraded kitchen ware as much as I cook.
4424,lol. how many kids do you have? I have two and they are 2 and 5
4424,Mine are all adults. All 5 of them.
4424,Oh wow. Do you miss them being little?
4425,Next Week
4425,Good for you - were will you be going?
4425,I will be going to Spain
4425,How lovely!  I have always wanted to go to Spain.
4425,Yeah it is amazing! i am fluent in spanish so it is quite easy
4425,"I just spent 7 months in Latin America, my Spanish is better now."
4425,How comes you spent 7 months there?
4425,"It was a ""bucket list"" thing, I had studied Spanish for 6 years in school but never did a study abroad"
4425,thats pretty amazing! what did you do out there?
4425,I checked out a lot of needle craft artisans and enjoyed swimming on the Pacific Coast
4425,that sounds like a vacation to remember
4425,"Yes, I also drafted a book with a lot of the highlights"
4426,Maybe you should plug in the charger?
4426,just got a new lap top and i think my battery is no good
4426,what make is it?
4426,hp 2000. i may have to return it to the store to be quite honest
4426,"you should if its new, that doesnt sound right!"
4426,yeah but the store is over 20 miles away. i live out in the country lol
4426,oh thats pretty far
4426,indeed. and i have a major report due soon. im hoping an neighbor has a spare battery
4426,what is the report on?
4426,the importance of making air to water generators mainstream
4426,that sounds interesting! why is it important?
4426,its important because piped water is poisonous and i was hired to write the report
4427,He is doing so well in school. Its amazing to watch them grow.
4427,"That's great to hear, what grade is he in if you don't mind me asking?"
4427,He is in kindergarten.
4427,"Oh that must be so exciting, so much time left to watch him develop as a person."
4427,Yes. He is already so grown up. Everyone says how they are so sad to see them grow up I cant wait to see the young man he will become.
4427,"That's a great attitude. I wouldn't mind having kids myself, but I'm not attracted to men if you know what I mean so it's a bit tough."
4427,Oh I get that yeah.
4427,"Indeed, and the costs of getting a donor are pretty expensive actually."
4427,Yes. Adoption might be a good way... or maybe fostering kids
4427,"Oh adoption is a good idea, I didn't really consider that, but it seems like the ethical choice."
4427,yeah :) 
4427,I guess I will do some research and try to find children around my area.
4428,What about played the game Stick Of truth?
4428,I have played the Stick of Truth.  It definitely captures that South Park vibe.  Have you played that one?
4428,Actually I haven't played it. I listen to music more than play games.
4428,"I'm a big gamer, but also love listening to music.  I have a pretty eclectic taste in music, do you have any specific genres you prefer?"
4428,"I listen to avenged sevenfold quite a bit, but i also like a lot of old music. I collect records of all sorts."
4428,I have never heard of Avenged Sevenfold.  What kind of music is that
4428,"Heavy Metal i guess, but they have nice themes."
4428,I'll have to check them out. I don't have a huge number of heavy metal bands I listen to so it'll be good to add to that.
4428,well what is your favorite band?
4428,I've really gotten into listening to Billie Eilish this year.
4428,Well thats one i don't know! whats it like?
4428,"Her music is different.  I'd say it's more of an indie alternative style, usually with heavy driving beats and unusual vocals."
4428,i will have to give it a try. Been nice chatting!
4429,Thank you. I like to spend time outside reading to help cope.
4429,That will be nice.
4429,It is. The stories help me feel better and being one with nature makes me feel god. 
4429,i agree . positive vibes stick to books because they make people happy .
4429,I agree. What do you like to do?
4429,I love hanging out with friends.
4429,Friends are great. Do you enjoy reading at all or do they?
4429,I do read occasionally.
4429,What do you like to do with your friends?
4429,Listening to music and playing football.
4429,I too enjoy music and sports!
4429,That is nice. What is your favorite sport?
4430,"I work at the local grocery store, so I know heavy lifting "
4430,what grocery store do you work at?
4430,I work at the local Harris Teeter in virginia beach
4430,Do you like it?  I need to get ready for a piano lesson after my haircut today.
4430,I wish I could play the piano !  Its a wonderful talent to have at parties 
4430,"Yeah, I am lucky to have been encouraged as a child."
4430,my mother played in church for years but i was not fortunate enough to be encouraged 
4430,It is getting rare for families to have a piano in the house.
4430,yes I agree as fewer people now can afford them 
4430,I grew up on a farm and it was a way to entertain the family
4430,what part of the country did you come from ?  I assume you had farm animals as well ?
4430,"The midwest, it was a dairy farm with cows and chickens"
4431,"I am. The restaurant is going well, and we are planning on opening another one in the next few months."
4431,"Great! I'm enjoying raising the kids. The hubby and I agreed that no one should raise our kids, but us."
4431,I couldn't agree more! My mother raised me until she passed when I was 18.
4431,"Sorry for your loss. He's a Data Analyst and makes a six-figure salary, so we agreed that it's a sure thing for me to stay home."
4431,It's very nice that you guys can afford that. I don't think you'll ever regret the decision.
4431,I'm grateful we are able to do this. There are many families who wish they could and I truly sympathize with them.
4431,I'm one of them. We've been putting off having children until now just because we didn't think we could afford it.
4431,I understand that. We started early enough so we'd have time to balance the career and work.
4431,"Oh, I don't regret it at all. We still have time as we're both young."
4431,That's good. I love that everything worked out for us. I don't think the little one's would handle a nanny well at this point lol.
4431,"Hah, yeah, they certainly do get into a routine quickly."
4431,"They really do. I don't think a nanny wold enjoy exploring outside, catching butterflies and going on walks with magnifying glasses 3 times a week."
4432,"thats quite a lot, i only sleep around 5"
4432,that sounds productive
4432,"yeah i get a lot done during the day, i like to pray before bed"
4432,"That reminds me of that Kesha song, Praying. I love that song!"
4432,"yeah its good, i want to become less selfish so i talk to god to guide me"
4432,good to trust in a higher power ! always time to change .
4432,"yeah exactly, are you religious?"
4432,"No I am not, I believe in being a good person"
4432,yeah thats always a good way to be
4432,Thank you. I like to stay humble and keep good morals
4432,"yeah, everyone should think like that"
4433,We have great wines to pair with our beef here also.
4433,"oh really, what kind of wines?"
4433,"Mostly red wines, I like a good cabernet with my steak"
4433,"yeah, i agree! i love to enjoy wine overlooking the land"
4433,"I really admire Japanese art, painting and sculpure - and those gardens"
4433,yeah art is wonderful!
4433,"I didn't like cleaning until I learnd about Feng Shui, the art of decluttering"
4433,There is a good netflix series about cleaning 
4433,Oh? what is it called?
4433,im not sure i think it is called tidying up
4433,"Thanks, maybe I will look it up for some new inspiration"
4433,yeah you should its inspiring 
4434,thank you
4434,You're welcome.  I'm just wondering -- do you find it easier to work when it's quiet or when there is music or talking in the background?
4434,I can work with both but I prefer music or tv in the background
4434,"I prefer music when I'm working, but without words.  Classical is best.  "
4434,Oh thats nice. whats youf favorite 
4434,"Classical piano, I suppose.  "
4434,nice. I like the chello.
4434,"Yes, cello is nice too.  What type of garage does your cousin operate?"
4434,I was wondering if I spelled that) cello) right lol He runs a motorcycle garage.
4434,Oh yeah! Cool --  I draw motorcycles in some of my cartoon work.
4434,oh thats awesome
4434,"Yeah, there's so much detail that goes into the drawing.  I can only imagine how much detail there is in building a real bike.  "
4435,I don't think the army is right for me. I don't Trust the motivations of those in control of the government.
4435,you shouldnt give up on your government. are you a republican or a demorcrat?
4435,More of a Libertarian actually. I haven't given up on the hope that we as a people can see past issues that seem to keep us occupied.
4435,There are many people with a similar mindset in the military. It is a good place to be if you want change.
4435,While being apart of a large group like that is appealing I'm not sure i could respect my commanders.
4435,I bet you could! Many of them are amazing leaders with impressive career histories
4435,Well i set by the lake near my house and think on such serious topics. I will give it some thought while fishing.
4435,"That sounds like a nice time! Every branch has many benefits for sure. If you enjoy the water, go navy."
4435,I know that many people end up with good jobs after their terms of service. can i be an officer if i start out enlisted?
4435,Yes! Upward mobility is widely encouraged! As long as you stay in shape and keep getting educated. 
4435,what branch are you in?
4435,Im an officer in the Army Corps of engineers.
4436,"Oh really, what kind of authors do you like?"
4436,I like little known authors like Mary Burton and Mary Kubica.
4436,"That's cool, I've never heard of them. I don't do much reading, just trying to catch sick waves out here."
4436,"LOL, my favorites are psychological thrillers. They have lots of twists and turns in the plot."
4436,"That's dope, it reminds me of when I try and twist and turn to ride through the peak of a gnarly 20 footer."
4436,"LOL, you are lucky to live near the ocean but that sounds dangerous."
4436,"It comes with the territory, sometimes you have to risk it for the biscuit as they say. I don't say that though because it sounds lame."
4436,"No, it doesn't. Everything in life comes with some risk."
4436,"I guess, I feel so in tune with the ocean though that nothing can hurt me, I'm like in a state of Nirvana or something like that."
4436,I can understand! That is the way I feel about books and music!
4436,"That's rad dude, do you like envision yourself as one of the characters in the book? Totally wicked!"
4436,"No, I have never got that engrossed!  I do get engrossed at the ocean thinking about how life began."
4437,Not into gambling myself. More of a stay at home and watch shows kind of person. 
4437,Thats still rewarding though! have you never been to Las Vegas? ive been and seen Bon Over there
4437,No I do want to move there eventually. How did you like it? 
4437,I loved it. Ive been many of times. Its even better now that all resturanmts have vegan options
4437,Any standout restaurants? 
4437,there is a wing place near me. the lemon pepper one are good too. used to be my favorite
4437,vegan wings? or just regular?
4437,Vegan now. prviously it was normal. And are both very tasty. Do you enjoy wings?
4437,They are one of my favourites! I have a huge batch ready to grill for lunch!
4437,do you make them spicy or with herbs?
4437,Spicy is preferable. I do like a garlic Parmesan every now and then as well. How about you?
4437,the hotter the better! sometimes it can be too warm though  i also love garlic. usually have it with evrything.
4438,I made up a pretty good excuse.
4438,What did he say?  Do you need to look for a new job?
4438,"I just said my daughter is really into drawing right now, I can't keep up with how much paper she goes through"
4438,Did it seem like he believed that?
4438,"Yes, actually. And since I was going to be working late, I didn't want to take the time to stop at the store"
4438,"Oh man, I guess he is a understanding boss.  Did you feel embarrassed?  "
4438,"Yes, I did. I was thinking to myself, I shouldn't be doing this - I could just hit the $1 store"
4438,"Yeah,  I have been there.  I got caught working on my resume at work one time."
4438,I'm also trying to get gigs at the local theater while working at this restaurant where I cook
4438,I hope that works out.  
4438,"Thanks, I think it's important to try new things in life"
4438,"That is true,  I need to try something new too."
4439,what year
4439,"2017, I was there, it was awesome! Have you played any of the new battlefield games?"
4439,no way! /I have played it
4439,Do you like it? The graphics look amazing.
4439,its alright 
4439,Well that was underwhelming. What is your favorite color?
4439,green sorry im kinda shy
4439,"I love pink! Dont be shy, This conversation literally last for two minutes."
4439,lol pink and green go together :)
4439,Yeah if you are a toddler. HaHa. I also like yellow. Pink and yellow make me think summer.
4439,lol
4439,Do you like other video games?
4440,I wonder if someone has ever combined LARP and Rap Battles. yo gotti could do it i bet.
4440,yo gotti is dope . what music do you listen to ?
4440,"him, but also all the artists featured on that show empire. Also alot of pre 1980 rock, rnb, funk."
4440,RNB is a fun genre as well. I enjoy a bit of it.
4440,I think that i would enjoy tabletop rpgs more if my friends were on the same schedule as me.
4441,"That never happened to me, but I did almost choke to death on an avocado pit.  It got lodged in my throat accidentally.  "
4441,I am picturing the sandwich scenario. It looks like the crumbs would choke a person. I can understand an avocado though.
4441,"My brother tends to eat a sandwich that way. It's pretty disgusting, but he's my brother so I love him anyways. "
4441,"Yes, we look over the disgusting traits of people we love. We accept them with all their bad habits."
4441,"That is so true.  I have a cousin who I love dearly, but she's constantly clipping her nails in public and letting them land where they may. "
4441,Gross!  I hate to see someone at a dining table brushing their hair also.
4441,You're right.  One time her clipper slipped and poked me in the eye.  I ended up in the emergency room.  
4441,"Oh no, I hope your eye is okay. She could have easily blinded you."
4441,"You're telling me! But she apologized, so it's all good.  Anything like that ever happen to you?"
4441,"No, fortunately, I have never had anything like that happen. Guess I am lucky I don't have a gross cousin."
4441,"Yeah, some families are stranger than others.  I have another relative who crashed his motorcycle while I was riding on the back seat."
4441,"Wow, you have had some bad luck in life. The worst I have is an uncle who blows his nose while I am eating."
4442,Really
4442,"Yes, I can speak french and english.  Do you speak any other languages?"
4442,"I studied Spanish in my youth, however; can't speak it well now. "
4442,I have never tried them. but there are apps and programs that help you learn a language.  If your interested 
4442,Yes there are plenty. I spend more of my time researching diets for diabetics.
4442,Are you or someone in your family diabetic?
4442,"Yes, so I have found a cookbook with awesome recipes. "
4442,"It's nice we have so many resources.  My dad was a diabetic as well, but I don't feel like he had as much information available."
4442,Information is everwhere now. Thank God for the internet.
4442,"Yes, for sure.  But there are some big disadvantages as well. "
4442,"Of course, with the pros comes the cons."
4442,I guess that is like that with everything.  Here the fake news is the biggest con. 
4443,"I'm in a band and have a drum set in the garage, a racoon had gotteen in there"
4443,"Oh wow,  how did you get him out of the garage?"
4443,I just pushed the garage door opener button and it ran off
4443,Did you figure out how he got in?  Is there an opening someplace?
4443,"Someone had left the side door open after our band practice, along with some fast food"
4443,Oh good....at least it wasn't something that required handy man skills to fix.  
4443,"yeah, I know - I wish I knew a good handy man"
4443,Me too.  I could use one to do some work around my home.
4443,"I've tried some online services, but they are expensive!"
4443,"true,  I tend to ask friends or neighbors if they know of anyone."
4443,"yeah, I should do that more often"
4443,and then check reviews on yelp.  I found a good plumber through a neighbor recommendation.
4444,same here. What's your favourite subject?
4444,I love psychology! Which is funny because I dont like really talking to a lot of people. 
4444,Well you can study the human psyche without really talking to people so that's a plus. 
4444,Absolutely. What are you studying?
4444,I am studying Math. It is my favourite subject which makes it more fun than work.
4444,Do you want to be an engineer? Math is not my strong suit?
4444,I prefer data sciences. It is not for everyone that's for sure. Not as fun as psychology! 
4444,That still sounds very hard and I applaud your effort! I bet it is fun if you enjoy it. 
4444,"Oh I love it. I also don't like speaking with people, and luckily numbers don't talk back."
4444,For a person who is very bad at math I wish the numbers would talk back because then they could help me.
4445,Perhaps...maybe I was being insensitive. A slice of pizza is far from a solution to his problems.
4445,"That's true, although he could have at least shown some gratitude instead of cursing you out."
4445,Very true. I was humiliated. My family was with me so I may have been extra sensitive since I care about their opinion of me.
4445,"Well I can't blame you for that, but I guess everything has to be kept in perspective, or something like that."
4445,Indeed. So tell me about some of your life experiences. 
4445,"Well since we're on the subject of giving (sort of), my friend knew I was down on my luck and bought me a car once."
4445,What a friend. People can be so generous when people are without transportation. I've been on both sides myself.
4445,"Yes I do feel guilty though since I haven't repaid them back in full yet, but hopefully I will have by next year."
4445,I'm sure they are understanding of your situation. People usually don't give if they can't bear the burden of their gifts.
4445,"Those are wise words, I will try to remember those and not feel so bad, thank you."
4445,Glad to help. You'll get them paid back and when someone else needs a ride I bet you'll be quick to help them out.
4445,"I hope so, I will get negative karma I think if I don't help people when I've been helped myself."
4446,"Unfortunately, I've already eaten a lot of them myself."
4446,I do that too! 
4446,Then I don't feel so bad. What kinds of snacks do you typically buy?
4446,I get fruit and like some type of cookie or cracker
4446,"My children prefer nuts, but the school has a peanut-free policy."
4446,wow. 
4446,"I think that's increasingly common these days, at least in my state."
4446,probably and thats a good thing though. 
4446,"I agree. Still, I'm surprised at how many people seem to have nut allergies these days. I don't think it was that common when I was growing up."
4446,yeah I know that does seem werid
4446,Do you have any allergies?
4446,I have oral allergy syndrome.
4447,Wow must be great having children. How are they?
4447,It's great. They make me feel young. Have to keep up with them.
4448,"That's the reason I switched careers.  I used to be a nurse, now I'm a cartographer."
4448,What was your reasoning behind why you switched careers?
4448,I needed something less stressful.
4448,Was there anything in particular that was stressing you out at your previous job?
4448,"Nursing is stressful, it's very busy and you're dealing with people when they are very ill."
4448,"Yes l've heard nursing can be very stressful. It's good you switched jobs, to reduce stress!"
4448,What do you do for work?
4448,"I am a teacher. I teach grade 1, it is somewhat stressful, but manageable. "
4448,Teaching is such an important profession.
4448,"Yes, certainly is! "
4448,How long have you been teaching for?
4448,I have been teaching for 8 years. I'm really enjoying it. 
4449,"its a pair of snow skis actually, but i dislike to ski :("
4449,Was that the only prize in the raffle?
4449,well i also got a pen but who needs that?
4449,So you don't like either prizes.  You could donate them or sell them if you wanted to.
4449,yeah i think that is a good idea. I could sell them and buy something cool. any ideas?
4449,I don't know.  What do you do for a living?  Maybe you could get something to help at work.
4449,well i work in security. perhaps i could buy a new coat
4449,That sounds like a reasonable item to purchase.
4449,what do you do for a living? did you go to school in the US?
4449,Im currently a janitor.  I did go to school in the US and graduated top of my class.
4449,I wanted to be a model but i broke my nose in the fifth grade (while skiing actually) and it healed crooked. My jobs not bad though.
4449,My mother fell ill.  Janitor was the only job I could find with flexible hours to suit my needs.
4450,Ever since I was a kid I have like to pretend that I was a tiger
4450,"Tigers are strong and brave animals, i really love them too."
4450,Maybe it's my totem animal... do you believe in that?
4450,I believe the do.
4450,Do you know anyone that speaks German? I am looking for someone to practice with
4450,"No, i wish i knew someone that could help."
4450,"Maybe I will just call up my Grandma, she'd probably love to catch up in German"
4450,Yes!Well German is a widely taught non-English language! I'd suggest taking some classes!
4450,I studied for six years and hope to travel there next year
4450,That will be quite an adventure!
4450,Have you been to Europe?
4450,"Yes, i have been to London and Manchester."
4451,I love reading horror.  Have you read much from Stephen King?
4451,no but i heard a lot about him what book you recommend 
4451,"If you like the scarier ones, I'd recommend Salem's Lot or Carrie.  Some of his best, though not scary in my opinion, are the Gunslinger series. "
4451,I'm actually going to the book store today i will have to check it out. I'm not into may scary things
4451,"I like a wide range of books, but horror is a big component.  Do you have a favorite genre of books you normally read?"
4451,i normally read young adult books. I'm currently reading since you been gone I'm really enjoying it. you listen to audiobooks
4451,"I haven't listened to audiobooks before, but it's something I've considered while I'm driving.  It seem really convenient."
4451,I enjoy audio books on long drives or when I'm cleaning i forget I'm cleaning fall into the book lol
4451,"That sounds great.  I've heard that, frequently, have some celebrities or even the writers narrate their books, like Neil Gaiman."
4451,whats your favorite book 
4451,"Oh, that's a hard one.  I have to say that favorite book is probably The Gunslinger from King's Dark Tower series."
4451,that series is like 8 books correct? picking one book is always hard 
4451,"Yeah, there are a lot!"
4452,Does it change its effects of it is consumed in different ways?
4452,"It sure does! The delivery method affects things like how fast it causes you to feel the effects of the drug, intensity and enjoyment etc."
4452,Interesting. What kind of investment opportunities are there in this industry?
4453,"Oh, sorry to hear that.  I'm sure that was hard as a child to go through."
4453,It was tough but it was a long time ago.  
4453,How old were you when you lost them?
4453,I was 10 when it happened.  It was very tough for a few years 
4453,"I am sorry you had to go through that, I am sure it was very tough."
4453,"Yeah, time helped and I eventually found some true friends that are family to me."
4453,I am glad that you have found true friends.  That is so important to have. I don't know what I would do without my friends. 
4453,"Yeah,  its nice to know you have someone that has your back.  A support system."
4453,"Yes, need someone to have you back in this world we live in. "
4453,I agree. That is why I just signed up for big brother program.  
4453,"Oh, that;s great that you do that.  I would love to get involved in something live that."
4453,I'm sure there are local organizations you can help with; some churches have outreach programs.
4453,"Thank you, I will look into some programs like that. "
4454,"Yeah, it was probably the best time of my life. My mom and I still talk about it all the time!"
4454,I can't remember a lot about being in elementary school.  
4454,It's probably a little easier for me since my mom reminds me about it all the time haha.
4454,"I was a cheerleader in high school.  That's how I met my husband, so I remember those days pretty good."
4454,That's really cool! Have you been with your husband since high school?
4454,"Yes.  We have been married for 38 years, but together for 42 years."
4454,"That's great, I hope I can find somebody I can be with for that long. I'm single right now."
4454,Do you work?
4454,"Yes, I work in the meat department at a grocery store."
4454,"I do a lot of traveling.  I won the lottery 6 years ago, so it has helped us live a pretty good life."
4454,"Wow, that sounds great. I've heard that it can be surprisingly difficult to be a lottery winner, do people treat you differently now?"
4454,Nobody knows.  We thought it best to keep a secret.
4455,it was not good 
4455,No i am sure it wasn't.  I hope you at least left her and him.
4455,Need to take some time and clear my head befor reacting
4455,oh that is terrible ! i am so sorry ! my heart goes out to you . how long were you together ?
4455,10 years
4455,That was a long time.  Did you have kids together?
4455,Yes 2 a boy and girl
4455,"Oh, I am sure this is hard on them as well.  I hope the best for all of you"
4455,Thank you  it helps to be able to talk things out
4455,Not a problem I know times are tough but just keep your chin up and you will get through it.
4455,thank you
4455,"You are welcome.  You can come over any time, I have some guitars and games and such to get your mind off things"
4456,Yea I spend alot of time with them and would love to get into business with them
4456,"Well i have pretty steady work fixing airplanes, but when i retire i'd like to open a Record Store. I own Hundreds of Vinyl albums."
4456,Wow that's fantastic. When I retire I'd probably just sit around playing video games and sketching Disney characters
4456,retiring seems to be everyone's fantasy . what is your favorite Disney character ?
4456,"Has to be the Genie from Aladdin, easily! How about yours?"
4456,The Fox version of Robin Hood. although Merlin was a fav as well
4456,Good choice that would probably be one of my Top 5 too. Have you seen the latest Lion King?
4456,"Ooh The Lion King was a great film, a part of the Disney Renaissance of animated films. Is the new one as good?"
4456,YES! It is 10x better than the original in my opinion but others say that the characters lack facial expression and emotion but I strongly disagree. A Must watch!
4456,i would like to see it for sure but i am going to have to take some time off from work.
4456,You have to! Everyone is too busy nowadays with work but they should take some time off
4456,i know . i just got to find the time .
4457,Wow! Thanks. I never knew that.
4457,Do you have a favorite flavor of milkshake?  Mine is good old chocolate.

4458,Absolutely.  Coffee is warm and welcome here where I live in the north. 
4458,Do you drink any other hot drinks such as hot chocolate or hot buttered rum?
4458,"Actually, I love the Frozen Chocolate at Dunkin.  I have also had hot chocolate often.  I love sipping it while I play Nintendo. "
4458,"I'll have to try the Frozen Chocolate, sounds delicious.  I'm from the south so typically enjoy cold drinks."
4458,"Its cold here in the great white north, so hot drinks are the preference, and spend long winters indoors. "
4458,I grew up on the Gulf coast but LOVE cold weather and especially snow.  Think I should move to Alaska perhaps.
4458,I took a vacation to Alaska. Loved it. I vacation in the Tampa area every other year.  You are lucky to live in the South.  Sunny most days.
4458,"Yes, but very humid.  I have family in the Tampa area and enjoy visiting them."
4458,I get bored stuck indoors alot so I pass time playing Nintendo.  Tampa is a big sports oriented city. You like the Bucs?
4458,Tampa is into a lot of sports.  I haven't watched the Bucs much.  Not on TV very much are they?
4458,"Not too often.  But that's ok, they lose alot.  Have a wonderful day. "

4460,"Oh really,  a big company?  Are you a writer?"
4460,its a small newspaper locally

4461,Reading and playing football
4461,"Well that sounds nice, do you mean American style football or the other football?"
4461,I mean soccer.
4461,"Oh I see, thanks for the clarification. I used to play that when I was young, but now I'm old and retired."
4461,What was your best position?
4461,I think I was best at being a striker but sometimes they would put me in as goalie for some reason.
4461,"That's nice, i believe you were also good as a goalie?"
4461,"Well I was alright I guess, but it was quite boring compared to being a striker!"
4461,"That's true, for me i prefer the midfield role."
4462,yes it is How many kids do you have
4462,"I have two boys! They're great, but boy are they a lot of work. Do you have any kids?"
4462,yes two boys too

4463,"That game sure can take some time, but it can also be rewarding. Do you win often?"
4463,Occasionally I do. Have you ever played it before?
4463,"I have, but it isn't really my style. I prefer games that work with my hobby cooking."
4463,What type of cooking games are there?
4463,I like to do cookoffs with my friends and then we all get to taste the yummy food!
4463,What's the best thing you have cooked?
4463,"I like to think I'm best when making pastry, so probably a croissant or cake"
4463,I wish I could cook. I am pretty bad at it.
4463,Anyone can learn with enough practice. Just keep trying. Do you have any pets?
4464,"Yes, I actually do a lot of online shopping. "
4464,Amazon is my favorite.  Free shipping right to my front door.  I order from them ever week.  I live alone so its my way to stay busy.
4464,I love Amazon too! That's where I order mostly from. Amazon Prime!!
4464,I agree. Prime is a wonderful service.  I hope they keep the annual fee unchanged. Do you watch movies on Amazon also?
4464,No I haven't ever watched movies on Amazon. Have you?
4464,"Yes, I love the Amazon original programs.  I also use Netflix.  Do you have Netflix?"
4464,Yes I do have Netflix! Watch it every day and have it playing in the background a lot too!
4464,I watch action and comedies on Netflix.  I avoid love stories.  Sadly I just don't believe in love. 
4464,Comedies are my favorite! I'm sorry you don't believe in love. 
4464,And I do enjoy watching Stranger Things on Netflix.  I can't wait till season 4 is released.
4464,I've heard good things about that show! I just haven't had a chance to watch it yet.
4464,I binge watched all 3 seasons.  Try it sometime.  Soon I may subscribe to Disney plus the new streaming service.  Did you hear about it?
4465,"Skunks are the worst!  I live in the mountains, so I see a lot of different animals."
4465,"Well be careful when you're looking around -- some skunks are ginger colored, rather than black and white!"
4465,I didn't know that!  We see a lot of possums.  They're bad for getting into garbage.
4465,"Yeah that true, just be careful out there."
4465,Do you live in the mountains or the city?
4465,I live in the city.
4465,"I've lived in the mountains all my life.  I've traveled around the cities, and I don't think I could get used to the traffic."
4465,Traffic is horrible but we still manage with our daily jobs
4465,What do you do?
4465,I am a mechanic.
4465,My husband is a mechanic and electrician.  He works in the mining industry.
4465,That's nice
4466,I went to Rome but was hard because I am very shy
4466,did your boyfriend make it easier since he's traveled internationally before?
4466,No because I had to my dog behind so we were both very worried about him
4466,"Oh no, that's terrible! I'd love to have dogs but I just can't afford them right now."
4466,my dogs name is Jack and he is my best friend
4466,did you fall in love with him when you first met him ?
4466,oh yes he is a cutie
4466,what breed is he?
4466,mix
4466,I love mutts. someday I want to live on a farm with a whole herd of dogs if I could just get my life together.
4466,yes me to
4466,Did you get your dog from an animal shelter?
4467,This will be my 1st kid.  Excited and nervous
4467,Don't be.I am sure you are ready.
4467,Yeah but its a lot of responsibility and my career is just starting.
4467,"that is understandable, but is anyone really ready to have a baby? The career will always be there.  ."
4467,That is true.  Guess its more nervous excitement.  Kinda like that first interview. 
4467,"oh , definitely . i get that . But ready or not here comes the baby."
4467,Very true.  I've already bought a few baby supplies.  
4467,That's great! Buy everything you can and also you must have have a baby shower. That way people can gift you items you may need. Start a baby registry. 
4467,His mom already has taken care of that.  Gotta go ahead and start the college fund.
4467,That's a great idea! College is so expensive. I'm still paying off my student loans. 
4467,I have a few myself but I have no other debt so hoping to pay them off in 7 years.
4467,I wish my parents had set up a college fund for myself. It
4468,"I try, several times a year"
4468,"That sounds exciting, where do you like to go?"
4468,"mostly the south or northeast, you?"
4468,"I don't usually travel internationally, but sometimes I go to other Canadian provinces."
4468,"I have never been to canada, how is it?"
4468,"Well I enjoy it, but it can be hard if you're not a fan of the cold."
4468,"I don't mind the cold, as a hippie I like to just wander about lol"
4468,"I think you would like it then, Montreal is pretty receptive to hippies."
4468,"I may have to check that out, what is your favorite province?"
4468,"I like British Columbia, there are a lot of great parks and other nature-related things to check out there."
4468,Sounds like my kind of place.
4468,"Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"
4469,"Myself and some of my younger coworkers had to present to a big client, and they really liked the pitch"
4469,That's great! It must have been nerve-wracking leading the presentation.
4470,My poodle and I just went for a walk
4470,That's a good effective walk!
4470,"Yes, Nanette enjoys them and it's good exercise!"
4470,"Yes,, it's good exercise for everyone."
4470,It's good for her and I to get fresh air
4470,Yes I get to sit under the tree too and get some shade.
4470,That must feel very nice! 
4470,yes it is very relaxing to me .
4470,I can see why that would be peaceful
4470,"Very peaceful, with birds singing on the trees. Lol"
4470,Sometimes you just have to get away for a while and enjoy nature
4470,"yes , that's very true ."
4471,My dog has been sick and I need to stay home to take care of her.
4471,Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. I hope she gets better soon!
4471,Ya me too. Im really worried
4471,"I'm sure you are. I'm sure she will love being able to spend the extra time with you, even though she's sick. "
4471,Ya I've been so sad that I barely even sing in the shower anymore
4471,You should sing to her! I'm sure she'd love it!
4471,Im not sure. Ive only ever sung in the shower. What if she gets scared and runs away
4471,I doubt she'll run away! She loves you and it might make her feel better. 
4471,OK I'll give it a try.
4471,Yay! I think it will make her so happy!
4471,Do you sing to your dog?
4471,I'm a horrible singer! But I sing all the time anyways. My 3 dogs typically start running around and playing when I start singing!
4472,She's only 3 weeks old
4472,Oh wow she must be so tiny!
4472,"She really is, the cutest thing ever. I named her Stella, after a hero I read about in my comics."
4472,"That's cool, is she still with her mother?"
4472,"Unfortunately her mother passed away, not even a day after she was born. But as is the circle of life. Her mom was a great dog. Do you have one?"
4472,"No I don't have a dog. I do have a cat though, she's about as energetic as a puppy!"
4472,"Oh wow! I love cats, dogs, and comics. They're my whole life :) Is she a kitten?"
4472,"Yes I think she would be considered a kitten, she's only a year old. I love animals too, I decided to become vegan because of how much I love them."
4472,"That's pretty cool, I've been trying to go vegetarian lately, Saturdays are the only day I allow myself to eat seafood."
4472,"That's a great way to ease into your new diet! It took me awhile too, I didn't go fully vegan until a year after I started the vegan diet."
4472,"Very encouraging to hear :). Not to be intrusive, but are you married? My boyfriend has been talking about marriage lately and I'm not sure"
4472,Yes I've been married for 47 years. Do you think you're scared of commitment in regards to marriage?
4472,"Oh okay great, and yes, also, I just dont know whether to trust him just because I've been rejected by men quite a bit"
4473,"yes, actually. I found some really cool graffiti in the basement of an old hospital"
4473,"Interesting, I love taking walks "
4473,"me too, I like normal walks with my boyfriend a lot too, not just exploring abandoned buildings."
4473,It seems like a nice way to relax and listening to music
4473,"It totally is! speaking of music, what do you like to listen to?"
4473,My prefer is Rock but I can listen any kind Romantic or even  pop
4473,cool! I like most genres but I'm so tired of pop because it's that they play where I work.
4473,where did you work ?
4473,I'm a barista at a local coffee shop. it's actually surprisingly a fun job and my boss is great
4473,"That seems like a nice place to work, tea and coffee are great"
4473,"one of my favorite things is that everybody is always so happy when you give them their drinks, like it makes their day better"
4473,that sounds fun ! yes it makes me happy and puts a smile on my face
4474,"Definitely the bar lol, I stayed at one club for the 3 days I was there XD"
4474,Vegas is always a popular destination for vacation!
4475,I prefer dogs. plus cats interrupt my sleep
4475,"I have two cats, they are relaxing to put when the purr.  But dogs are great for walking and you get exercise too. How many dogs do you have?"
4475,I have 1. She's almost 15 so not really into exercise. Do you only have cats?
4475,"Yes, just cats.  I do try to eat healthy, but no exercise.  I eat lettuce, fruite and I love Kale.  Have you eaten it?"
4475,I like it cooked! I try to stay healthy by being well-rested with 8 hours of sleep every night. Do you think sleep is important to your health?
4475,"Yes, I track my sleep with my Fitbit tracker.  Do you have Fitbit?  Its a great way to track health stuff."
4475,I've heard it's useful but I don't have one. My mom and my grandmother both have one which is not surprising since they're so alike- looks and personality wise.
4475,I recommend getting an older model to get started.  The new Fitbits are expensive.  Then if you like it invest in the newer version.  
4475,Is that what you did?
4475,"Yup!  I was not sure about the Fitbit, so I cautiously approached it and concluded its now something I cannot live without."
4475,What else do you do for you health? I take supplements
4475,"Yes, I take vitamins.  Go to my doctor regularly for checkups.  And, eat lots of that Kale.  Kale is a super food. "
4476,"Wow you really know a lot about dogs, where did you learn so much?"
4476,I watched a lot of shows about dogs as a kid. Is there a kind of dog you want?
4476,"I'd like a small one that can sit in my lap as I watch movies, I really like watching foreign movies."
4476,"wow, that sounds pretty great to me! I'm more of an action movie person, but foreign films can be fun too"
4476,"Action movies are fun to, I like the really obscure films because you see some really interesting story lines and creativity."
4476,"that's very true, it's fun to see what a director can do when they don't have a studio telling them ""no"" to their ideas"
4476,"Exactly, you totally get me! Have you ever heard of ""The Room""? It's not foreign, but it's quite a film."
4476,No I haven't. Is it good?
4476,"Well, it's one of those films that's so bad that it becomes good, it makes for a lot of laughs at the very least."
4476,"I love films like that! Sharnado is a great example, it's just like a trainwreck that you can't look away from haha"
4476,I'll have to check that one out next!
4476,Are there any other movies you recommend? I keep a running list of ones that I need to watch
4477,It's probably because of my upbringing.  My parents were more into sports than dance.  What about you?
4477,Mine too. I've always grown up watching sports. But I love the ballet too. 
4477,"That's cool.  I enjoy the NBA, is there a particular sport that you watch the most?"
4477,I actually don't watch much basketball. Mostly football and baseball. But my job has kept me from watching a lot of sports lately. 
4477,I know how that goes.  Do you follow professional or college more?
4477,Professional for baseball and college for football. I hope to catch a live game once I move to San Diego in two months!
4477,"That sounds great!  I've never really gotten into baseball, but I enjoy college football.  Who's your favorite team?"
4477,My favorite college football team is LSU. What about you?
4477,"LSU, nice.  Not too far from there.  I'm a fan of UT."
4477,"Nice, I'd love to see a LSU game in person!"
4477,"I'd love to see a Texas game in person, too.  I've never been to a college football game in person."
4477,Me either! I've heard they're a lot of fun!
4478,wait is this a magic game
4478,"no,  just some ideas for a painting containing a fruit bowl."
4478,do you paint pets? I have 4 pets
4478,I do.  I painted a photo of a horse for a client and a cat.
4478,I have 2 dogs and a cat
4478,Do they play well together?
4478,they do like each other and I have a fish
4478,i have a beta fish.  I have been thinking about getting a puppy for my son.
4478,Yes my fish is a beta too
4478,Mine is blue.  Its my sons favorite color. 
4478,mine too
4478,He once said the fish didn't do anything which is why i am thinking about a puppy.
4479,I believe it's won several awards.
4479,My boyfriend of 5 years loves it
4479,I normally don't enjoy fantasy shows and prefer documentaries.
4479,I like adaptions like lucifer
4479,I'm not familiar with that show.
4479,Its great its based on a dc comic
4479,"Well, I do like Satan, so maybe I'll give it a shot."
4479,you should i highly recommend it. its on netflix
4479,What other shows would you recommend?
4479,I zombie is great. its about a zombie that solves crime by eating brains
4479,I have seen some of that show. I like Rob Thomas.
4479,hes great but the actress that plays liv is the best
4480,Do you like staying home over going out?
4480,I like staying home over going out. Nothing beats a good cartoon at home
4480,"I agree, a nice bath and some take out beats staying out any day!"
4480,It's just a relaxing break from always being on your feet. Do you work?
4480,"I am lucky enough to be a stay at home mom to my four kids, what do you do for work?"
4480,"Four kids, that must be a lot! I'm a high school teacher, so I know what that's like!"
4480,"It is a lot but I love it! Oh that must be exciting, what subject do you teach?"
4480,I happen to be a biology teacher; it's so exciting to see the students learning about something new!
4480,"I'm sure, and such an interactive class as well. Do your students interact well?"
4480,"Yes, everyone seems to get along well. But you know high school students, they're not perfect! lol"
4480,I bet you could tell some stories haha I could write a book after being home with four kids!
4480,"Yeah, four kids is a lot, how do you find time for yourself?"
4481,"I don't, no! i have no kids"
4481,"I remember Mileena, a player from the Mortal kombat fighting game."
4481,That's right ! Cant believe I'm getting that old 
4481,i agee. i used to loooove playing mortal kombat.
4482,"Some deadlines at work suddenly came up, unfortunately."
4482,That maybe would not be bad as I dont like kids so staying home as they are on vacation might be good
4482,"Sometimes the kids can get on my nerves, but I was really looking forward to some time at the beach."
4482,I love the beach but i don't like acting like its ok with the kids running around
4482,My son is a little too wel behaved. Sometimes I wish he would just run crazily and not overly worry about what other people think.
4482,yes that would be nice I guess
4482,So what did you guys do for your summer vacation?
4482,We just do touristy things and ate a lot of delicious food. It was a good time.
4482,"Sound great to me! At my age, I just want the simpler enjoyments of life."
4482,That makes sense.  You do what makes you happy and feel like your life is worth living.
4482,My main focus nowadays is to lose some weight. I run alot but do you have any better suggestions?
4482,you can do it
4483,"yeah, it's super frustrating. If I was as bad at my job as the federal government is, I would be fired by now!"
4483,Well I hope that all that wont deter you from taking that vacation. You need it!
4483,"thanks! I would never live anywhere but texas, but I do really want to visit europe this summer"
4483,"Texas is great, I love the weather there, but everyone should travel outside the country at least once in their life."
4483,"yes, travel is very important. have you ever been out of the country?"
4483,A couple of times actually. I have went over seas just to experience the Tour de France. You know I love cycling.
4483,that's really cool! do you cycle yourself or just like to watch?
4483,"I have my own bike, but I have never entered in any races. "
4483,"cool! even if you don't race, I'm sure it's still fun just to get out there and enjoy nature and the exercise"
4483,Definitely! What about you? Do you still run?
4483,"yeah, I like to run sometimes but mostly I go for walks around my neighborhood. it's easier to get the motivation to walk than it is to run"
4483,Walking is always a nice activity. Sometimes its just great to get out and stretch your legs.
4483,"yeah, exactly. sometimes it's just about doing something instead of nothing lol"
4484,I work as a biology teacher in high school. But how many siblings do you have?
4484,"I have 4 brothers all older, it is crazy"
4484,"Four brothers!? Wow, you must be busy all the time lol. Do you spend more time with one, or all the same?"
4484,I spend my time with them all 
4484,"Well at least you'll never have a boring day. How old are your siblings, if you don't mind me asking."
4484,"15 and 17 , two boys sooo fun . what about you ? "
4484,"I have one sister and a brother, both of them are 12. But what about your other two brothers?"
4484,"yep, 11 and 23 years old "
4484,"Oh, does the oldest one go to college?"
4484,yes 
4484,"Ooh, where does he go?"
4484,"He is at college in Arizona, Im in Florida. Its expensive to fly him here or vise versa so I only see him maybe twice a year."
4485,"I don't have a Club 21 where I live, do they have a retail website?"
4485,I'm not sure. I've only ever shopped in the store. 
4485,"Oh okay, I will have to see if I can find them online; I normally do most of my shopping online anyway"
4485,"I like shopping online in theory, but you never know if things will fit. "
4485,"That is true, I normally shop brands I have bought from in the past so I know the fit already. "
4485,That is a good idea. I do that with old navy jeans. 
4485,"Yup, if I like something from a new brand I will look at reviews from people who bought it"
4485,"I do that too, but things often don't end up fitting right. "
4485,"Luckily I haven't had to many issues with fit, the times it has happened it was something from China"
4485,"hmm, maybe that is my problem. I've bought things online from shien and others. "
4485,I usually don't buy clothes online from China because they ALWAYS run at least 2-3 sizes smaller lol
4485,Totally makes sense. What are your favorite stores to shop at online?
4485,"Besides DK, I shop at Amazon, Zulily, Frederick's, and Torrid mostly"
4486,i'm not everyone's cup of tea.
4486,"I'm terrible as well, but I do enjoy comedians like Dennis Miller radio personality."
4486,i've been so busy lately training for my security clearance that i haven't had much time watch tv or listen to the radio. is he funny?
4487,That's great.  It must be fun to drive two vehicles.
4487,Sometimes it is but you'd be suprised how many times I bring the wrong keys!
4487,"I bet it is!  On my end I read a ton, I like literature.  For what it's worth, tacos too."
4487,"I love to read as well, I have a mini library in my home. Who is your favorite author?"
4487,"That's great, reading opens up a whole world.  Must be fun to have a mini library.  Right now short stories, Mark Twain."
4487,"Classic, one of mt favorites is Jean Auel. I am currently reading Kurt Vonnegut though."
4487,"Heard good things about Vonnegut.  Books and food might not go together, but I hope someone writes good literature with characters that like Mexican food."
4487,Who says books and food don't go together? Lol Reading a good book and eating a snack go hand and hand!
4487,That's true.  Sadly I leave food smudges on books!
4487,"Well as long as they are your books, no big deal!"
4487,"Usually a coffee or chocolate mark.  Do you bring books with you on your truck driving, for pit stops?"
4487,"Of course, always in my passenger seat. Something I like to read a few lines if I am stuck in stand still traffic, but that's a secret!"
4487,Great stuff!
4488,I just love traveling as I am a travel agent
4488,I also enjoy traveling!
4488,great  I am traveling to barbados next month 
4488,Oh that will be fun I would love to go there
4488,"yes first time for me, so I am excited"
4488,Oh that will be fun I would love to go there
4488,they have great deal
4488,You are so lucky! I love the Caribbean but I have never been to Barbados. Have you been there before?
4488,no
4488,It is beautiful
4488,yes very beautiful
4488,"You should visit when you have a chance, it is a magic place"
4489,really? are they in color or black & white?
4489,They are in color. Do you have any tattoos?
4489,Unfortunately not. I do like to sew though
4489,you sew clothing ? is that difficult ?
4490,"yeah, I love being a mom buy it's definitely difficult at times!"
4490,How many children do you have now?
4490,1 boy and 1 girl. I'm afraid if I have anymore I'll lose count lol
4490,"Well, big families are full of love, so that wouldn't be too terrible. Do you have siblings?"
4490,aww isn't that the truth? I just have an older brother
4490,"Oh, sure is. I grew up with a big loving family, but haven't decided on having children myself ."
4490,"that's fair, it's a really big decision to make so there's no rush. it sure does get old being asked when you're going to start having kids though"
4490,"As a mother, do you have time for hobbies? Laundry doesn't count, haha."
4490,"it depends, sometimes I manage to get some knitting done but I'm usually too tired from chasing around the kids"
4490,That's so cool. Knitting seems too challenging to me... maybe that's because the only time I sit still it to eat or read.
4490,"knitting is really relaxing. my other hobby is totally eating french fries though, ha!"
4490,I'm always down for some fries but favor pizza any day or meal.
4491,"Thankfully I have some preparation, helping relatives such as my grandmother.  What do you do?"
4491,That's cool. I have worked in a hospital as a nurse before. i love blue scrubes
4491,"That's great to know, I like hospitals because they are huge, so much going on, a lot of opportunity to do good.  Different than home care."
4491,I was working as an accountant before being a nurse
4491,"Wow, what do you like about both careers, or dislike?"
4491,I'm good just learning more about nursing home care
4491,Wish I knew more about accounting.  Home health care is easy and hard - all depends on what we're dealing with.  
4491,that's one of the risks of working in healthcare i suppose.
4491,"Yeah, it can be rewarding and heart breaking.  Do you also enjoy it?"
4491,"I do, it can definitely be overwhelming."
4491,What's the hardest part for you?  Sometimes I'm frustrated the patient tends to make the same mistakes that makes a problem worse.
4491,i still get very nervous but i am working on it .
4491,Great approach.  Good luck!
4492,"That's true, it's hard to not be discouraged, but if you give up, you'll certainly never make any progress. "
4492,"That is what I tell my self every time I try. Thankfully, I've been given some lucky breaks in the past."
4492,What do you do in order to cheer yourself up?
4492,I like to go to my happy place and meditate. The mountains make me feel at peace.
4492,That's nice. I live in the mountains too. I put on some cheesy music and like to wind down with a bottle of red wine. 
4492,I'm thankful to have my vacation home there. Life in the city gets a little hectic. I prefer moscato though!
4492,"When I wind down, what I try to do is break up my obstacle or failure into small steps and try to figure out where to regroup."
4492,That certainly sounds like a good approach. I've been learning a little about that while trying manage my new responsibilities at work.
4492,"It works for me, that and remaining calm. "
4492,"I wish I could be more like you, as a lawyer I feel like I'm running at full-speed all the time."
4492,That is a profession that takes a lot of mental work. I can see why. I'm in grad school to be a librarian. :)
4492,That is a noble profession. You certainly have the vibe of a librarian.
4493,It;s about a women in the prehistoical time period last from her clan trying to survive
4493,"Which one?  Was it good?  I've read a decent amount of those, but I'm always looking for more."
4493,Clan of the Cave Bear by Jean Auel. Its a 7 book series and it is fantastic! Highly recommend!
4493,"I think that book was first published by Jasper Fforde, in June of 2001."
4493,Actully ot was orignially publised in 1980.
4493,Oh my mistake i was thinking about a different book
4493,"No problem, they made a movie as well but only for book 1."
4493,The movie was actually ok it is in connection to the comic books Marvels Comics.
4493,Which movie are you talking about?
4493,its called meade halloween good movie
4493,"Oh, I'll have to look it up. It would be a perfect time of the year to watch!"
4493,"You should, it is worth a look!"
4494,Probably a squirrel. 
4494,"it might be, but you have to be careful.  they can get in your roof and have rabies"
4494,yikes. I hope it's not a raccoon. i've heard those can be bad too. 
4494,Maybe you should call in animal control
4494,Is that a service most cities provide?
4494,I believe so.  Unless you live outside city limits.
4494,Do you have any experience dealing with pests in the house?
4494,"Other than fleas no.  But hey, at least real pests can be gotten rid of.  Poltergeists are harder to evict."
4494,True! My dog has fleas right now and they have been really hard to get rid of. Any tips?
4494,"Vaccuum a lot, like daily.  and they make stuff for your yard, because that is where we always get ours from"
4494,It's cold enough to kill them in the yard here.
4494,You are lucky.  our last few winters have been so mild that the bugs don't die
4495,No but I felt that it was ready to leap at any moment
4495,I'd be scared it would escape. I am just glad it's not an alien creature I love watching star trek but thats scary
4495,"Ooh Star Trek is a good movie, which is your favorite one?"
4495,"I really enjoyed all of the movies, and I had watched the old shows with my cousin at the time, and that really sparked my interest. and you?"
4495,"I liked Wrath of Khan, but I guess that's a lot of people's favorite! I never watched it with family though"
4495,My cousin and his friends made the suits for it and I think a short clip of it. I love to see people having compassion with what they love
4495,"That sounds so cool! I work in finance, so there really isn't all that much excitement going on lol"
4495,I can definitely relate to that. It's harder these days to find anything interesting. You got hobbits?
4495,"Hobbies? Yeah I like to draw, especially the ocean"
4495,What is the reason for you to especially draw the ocean?
4495,"I guess I always liked the color blue, but it's very peaceful and yet powerful"
4495,"I never draw before, when did you start drawing?"
4496,It's is so hard to say goodbye.  I live in country and don't have many friends.  Do you have a lot of friends?
4496,i play music in my spare time to help with my sadnees
4496,I live a little like a savage I don't have many modern conveniences.  I get lonely.  What else do you do to help your sadness?
4496,I am committed to the environment 
4496,"Nice, do you have hobbies?"
4496,Yes a litlle and my ideal of fun is shopping at my favorite clothing retailer Guess.
4496,"I don't have th opportunity to do a lot of shopping.  I do read, do you like to read?"
4496,I do like reading. Lately I've been reading about Hanukkah music.
4496,I like self help books.  Do you read those types of books?
4496,yes
4496,"Great, what are your favorites?"
4496,too much to name
4497,"I'm a student, trying to get out of my current career. It's a class about product marketing"
4497,"Ah, Marketing. Fascinating and lucrative! What's your current career?"
4497,"I sell snakeskin oil, it's a dirty job but someone has to do it"
4497,I have never heard of that! Is it used as a beauty product?
4497,"yeah, it's pretty much an all in one cleanser/moisturizer. it works really well actually"
4497,"It shouldn't seem so wild to me, nature provides endless resources and gifts for mankind. I use coconut oil for everything myself. "
4497,"agreed, and using something is always better than nothing!"
4497,What do you do beyond school and work?
4497,"well, those things keep me pretty busy but I do enjoy a good movie every now and then"
4497," Growing up, I was always a reader. Lately, I've been frequenting the theater and am enjoying it. I recently saw The Joker and Luce."
4497,"I still need to see the joker, did you like it? everyone has been talking about it"
4497,"It was very good. Joaquin Phoenix captured the complexities well. The movie invoked many emotions from the views- sorrow, joy, and pity to name a few."
4498,"My goodness, that is unbelieveable.  You must be crushed!"
4498,"next to losing a child ,losing parents is the hardest thing a person can go through, I am still in high school and really miss him"
4498,"It must be.  I miss my grandparents dearly.  The generation above my parents is gone, I miss them all the time."
4498,I am a girl.  No one left to carry on our family name.  So when I marry I'll use my maiden name as middle name.
4498,"That's a good way to honor your family!  I feel upset also as I am out of work, farm work tough to comes by."
4498,"i hear you , my family owns a farm in pennsylvania.  its hard work, and costly to operate.  What do you grow?"
4498,"Corn WAS the big crop, and still is huge.  But a lot of farms are switching and opting for different ways to make money.  I'm a tomato person."
4498,"Tomato is such a versatile item, lots of demand.  I wish you lots of success.  Do you eat lots of veggies regularly?"
4498,"Yes, I eat tons of vegetables!  There is no question it tastes better in farm country.  I heard PA has some amazing apples."
4498,"Yes, I really love Honey Crisp apples.  I take one to school for lunch.  Do you like apple cider?"
4498,I like apple cider and apple cider donuts!
4498,Cider donuts.  Awesome.  I wonder if Dunkin sells them?
4498,Dunkins sells them!
4499,I love golden retrievers. I rescued mine when he was just a puppy.
4499,My favorites are huskies and big slobbery St Bernards. They give the best hugs and cuddles.
4499,My golden is so sweet but I hate he is having trouble getting up in my truck now that he is old.
4499,Do you at least get to ride in it with him?
4499,"Yeah, I have to lift him up in it now. Been looking to buy one of those pet steps that will work on a chevy."
4499,You should get a pink one
4499,"Yeah that may get some looks on the job site, though. Construction workers are not very forgiving."
4499,"Oh, yeah. I couldn't do that type of work. It is too stressful for me."
4499,You can't be afraid of heights or open yourself up for insults when you are a roofer.
4499,Ya I hate heights.
4499,"Don't tell anyone, but I do too. I just try to block it out when I'm up there."
4499,I won't tell anyone.
4500,"That's good life advice I think, perhaps I'll try to follow it. It's hard for me though because I worry about what other people think."
4500,That is a losing battle. We all have to learn to be ok with ourselves. 
4500,I suppose you are right. Shouldn't we care about what our parents think about us though?
4500,"be respectful. But they don't have to live our lives, we do. So we have to able to live with ourselves and the decisions we make."
4500,You speak with much wisdom and for that I am grateful. How did you become so wise?
4500,Observation of the world.
4500,"I see, I will have to do more observation myself so I can acquire wisdom, as I am definitely in need."
4500,There is always more to learn. 
4500,"Of course, do you have any suggestions for reading material?"
4500,C. S. Lewis - A grief observed or surprised by joy. 
4500,"Thank you, I will check it out as soon as possible."
4500,I hope you enjoy it!
4501,"LOL, exactly! Are you a student?"
4501,"No, I'm a middle school teacher for the 8th grade."
4501,"That is awesome, I have a lot of respect for teachers. How long have you been teaching?"
4501,It's been about 5 years now. I've learned a ton since i first started
4501,"Cool, did you always want to be a teacher?"
4501,"yea, I wanted to make a difference in as many students lives as I could "
4501,I can definitely understand wanting to make a difference. I actually help out with a food bank with some of my friends and family
4501,That's very nice thing to do and a really great way to help your community 
4501,Thank you. We gave away school supplies for back to school last month
4501,"That's good, I bet both the teachers and students greatly appreciate it! It's hard keeping spare supplies in my class sometimes "
4501,Do you have to purchase them yourself? Or do you have a school fund for them?
4501,We have to purchase them ourselves. My school will help out when they can.  
4502,"Oh, I'm so sorry that happened."
4502,"When he cheated on me, I found out over several months because he had been lying the whole time."
4502,I found out my boyfriend cheated when we ran into his other girl at the beach.
4502,What happened when you ran into his other girl at the beach?
4502,She ran up to him not knowing who I was. I like swimming but that ruined going to the beach for me.
4502,I'm sorry to hear that. What did your ex-boyfriend do? Did you confront him at that time when his other girl showed up?
4502,I left them both at the beach after getting the story from her. I didn't entertain anything he had to say.
4502,That is very sad. Did your boyfriend admit to his cheating after you found out? Did he try to win you back?
4502,He admitted to it after that day and wanted to salvage our relationship. I couldn't do that to myself though.
4502,It's not your fault that happened! He was a horrible person for doing that behind your back! Did you get any payback for that?
4502,"No, I just went swimming with my friends at the same beach the following weekend without him."
4502,Make sure he never gets back into your life again! My husband cheated on me and it ruined our family!
4503,what crafts do you do?
4503,Mostly vinyl tees. I've recently acquired an embroidery machine so I may start learning how to use it.
4503,that sounds pretty cool. do you sell them or keep them
4503,"I've made some as gifts. I've started to sell them at my kid's band concerts though, that has been fun."
4503,"Nice, what does your kid play"
4503,"He plays the guitar. He really likes it and of course now that he has gotten pretty good at it, I do too."
4503,The guitar is so beautiful especially acoustic
4503,It really is. I love that there is more than one type of acoustic guitar. I enjoy all kinds of music so its fun to have him play.
4503,I like indie bands the most for music. lots of talent
4503,"Yeah, I agree. I enjoy all types of music but I think Indie is my favorite as well."
4503,Has your kids band decided to go professionally
4503,He has started making YouTube videos and is enjoying the attention there. I think he will.
4504,"That's a cool game.  I used to play that years ago.  So tell me, do you play online?  "
4504,"Yes I do, I also like to play fortnite."
4504,I never really got into Fortnite.  I have a nephew who lives in New York that plays it all the time.  I love visiting New York.
4504,I was a huge fan of time sweeper and halo when I was younger. You mean New York city?
4504,"I used to play time sweeper too!  Wow, old school games.  Well I meant New York the state,  He lives in Manhatten."
4504,"Yeah time sweeper is an oldie, what games do you like to play these days?"
4504,"I enjoy playing on my Xbox One, I play on Xbox Live, I play Mortal Kombat 11 and Black Ops4 - Black Out mode."
4504,"Oh cool so like action stuff. I feel like I need a break from gaming, I have social anxiety, I still struggle to maintain eye contact with people sometimes."
4504,"Ahh yes,  you may have to take a short break from gaming go outside and maybe begin taking some walks,  get the blood flowing! "
4504,"I will try to exercise more , thanks for the tip. "
4504,"Not a problem,  I cant tell you from experience, it really helped me out a lot!  I am in shape now and feel great!"
4504,"That's awesome, what exercise helped you get in shape?"
4504,I began walking a mile every day and then slowly began running here and there.  At first it was hard.  
4505,"I like to listen to rap music, what about you?"
4505,i like indie music and reading poetry
4505,"That's cool, what's your favorite indie band?"
4505,imagine dragons and dermot kennedy
4505,"I've never heard of them, what songs would you recommend that I listen to?"
4505,radioactive album is really good
4505,Thanks I'll give it a listen. Which poets do you enjoy reading?
4505,atticus.. his new book is what i currently have
4505,"Alright, I'm not familiar but I'll make sure to check it out. Do you like to do anything else?"
4505,Popular one is Love her but leave her wild. I like cooking and wine
4505,"Cooking is great, it's so much healthier to make your own food than to dine out."
4505,That is so true! I am a real foodie now.
4506,Another reason for me not wanting to go is that I still live at home and I'm trying to save so I can move.
4506,It's not fun if you have to babysit an adult who loses their mind when they drink! Where do you want to move?
4506,For now I just want to have my own space. I don't have a particular place in mind.
4506,"My best friend lives in Japan, and that place is wonderful! I love going there to visit and experience the culture!"
4506,I've always wanted to go to Japan. I don't think I could live there though.
4506,It is a very expensive country but the culture is amazing. The people are so friendly!
4506,Yeah they also have a metal scene. I love death metal.
4506,Death metal is very fun! I have been to a few concerts in Scandinavia with some death metal bands. Who's your favorite?
4506,Well I really like Nile. Have you heard of them?
4506,I know of Nile and their roots in North Carolina. They are pretty cool! I like Carcass and Morbid Angel as my best bands.
4506,I like them too. Maybe we should go to a concert sometime.
4506,That would be very fun! I would love to go. What is your favorite venue for concerts that you have been?
4507,I should get together with them more often. The kids would appreciate that.
4507,"I don't see my parents much either. They taught me to find inspiration in the world, so I travel."
4507,"I like travel too.With my husband's work schedule, me and the kids sometimed vacation without him."
4507,Good job exposing your children to travel! What destination is on your bucketlist?
4507,"When the whole family goes, we would like to visit Disneyland and Epcot Center."
4507,That would be exciting. I have not been to either. 
4507,Where's the most interesting place you've been?
4507,"Hmmm, good question. It's a tie between Machu Picchu in Peru and The Great Barrier Reef in Australia. What about you?"
4507,Yellowstone
4507,"I haven't been there. I would like to, but should probably go back home for a little bit, to reconnect with family. "
4507,"Yes. If we went to Florida, I'd like to take my parents."
4507,LIfe is too short and our parents are only getting older. I wish it hadn't taken me so long to realize that.
4508,She did not like me driving cab for a living.
4508,"I hear you, some girlfriends have a big vision!  I went out with a Republican girl, but I am a Democrat, so she didn't like that."
4508,Republicans and democrats are like cats and dogs.
4508,They sure are.  Looks like we are on the same page when it comes to seeing that sometimes people don't see eye to eye and there's a reason!
4508,"Mind you, I never get to go out anymore since my breakup, so someone from a different political party might not be such a bad idea at this point."
4508,"That's a good point, it's always good to take in new perspectives.  I eat a ton of fish, actually almost entirely fish, so it limits a lot of things."
4508,"I am assuming you are a fisherman, otherwise I cannot think of why you eat almost entirely fish."
4508,Got to get my low cholesterol up - fish is a good way to do it.  It's a health issue.
4508,"I see, so it is a good cholesterol vs. bad cholesterol issue. My uncle had a heart attack years ago and high cholesterol was seen as the culprit."
4508,I hope your Uncle is ok!  Heart issues can sneak up on anyone.
4508,I am curious as to whether or not you prefer farmed salmon as opposed to wild.
4508,Unfortunately I go ahead and go with what's less expensive.  I try to stay away from (completely) frozen.
4509,My sport may be played on a lawn.
4509,Is it for adults or for kids?
4509,"Both enjoy the game, it's great fun for all ages!"
4509,Maybe I'll mention it to my son.  He's 18 years old and he loves the outdoors.
4509,"If he loves the outdoors, he would love skittles!"
4509,Skittles?  Do you mean the candy?
4509,"Well, I'm sure he likes the candy as well, but I'm talking about the game of course."
4509,"Oh.  It's similar to bowling, right?"
4509,Exactly! Have you ever played?
4509,No.  We own three dogs and four cats.  I'm always concerned that they're going to knock the pins down.  
4509,"Ahhh, well in that case you should come out and join us in the park! "
4509,Sounds like fun.  I'm a big believer in protecting large open spaces for recreational use.  
4509,"As the iron skittler, I agree. We need as much recreational space as possible!"
4510,"I don't know if he likes his job or not, but I am actually looking for a new job something more outdoors"
4510,"im sure you will find something you like, eventually"
4510,"I have a few interviews coming up, so it will be sooner rather then later. What work do you do?"
4510,I work as an IT helpdesk it's long hours but I enjoy it
4510,It's always good when you can actually enjoy the work you do
4510,For sure I love helping others the pay isnt bad either
4510,Doing something you love and great pay. You hit the jackpot!
4510,"yeah , my dad works 11 hours a day so life tough, I am blessed"
4510,How long has he been a janitor?
4510,"25 years! hes been such an amazing dad, since we are 6 siblings my mom needed all the help she could have!"
4510,"Wow! I bet she could, it seems like you have an awesome family :)"
4510,Were a tight k it
4511,"Yes, I will definitely be more cautious. Have you been to jail before for drunk driving?"
4511,"No, i'm actually a tea totaler "
4511,Do you run any programs?
4511,What do you mean by programs?
4511,Programs to help people with a drinking problem?
4511,No. Maybe you should check out alcoholics anonymous. 
4511,Thank you for the tip. What do you like to do in your free time?
4511,"I'm very social, so I like to spend time with friends. "
4511,Awesome. Me too. My friends and I enjoy camping on the weekends
4511,Do you cook by campfire as well?
4511,"Yes, mostly dried food. We typically dehydrate our own meals. "
4511,How do you do that?
4512,I love watching law related movies on Sundays.  Its just how I occupy my time on boring Sunday nights.  What do you like to watch?
4512,"I normally like to watch the latest shows on Netflix, like Dark. "
4512,Oh.  Did you also see any episodes of Stranger Things?
4512,"I did! I really enjoyed Season 3, I thought it was much better than Season 2. Have you watched it?"
4512,"Yes, I just finished binge watching season 3.  I cannot wait till season 4 begins.  I like the wierd storylines. Do you have any unusual skills?"
4512,"I studied German in school, so I can read and write that language. How about you?"
4512,Mine is really wierd.  I have a sleep disorder.  I walk in my sleep.  Scarey and wierd. 
4512,That does sound scary! Do you ever wake up in different places throughout the night?
4512,Many times.  I once woke up sitting in my neighbors front yard in the rain.  
4512,Have you ever gone to the doctor to find a cure for sleepwalking? That could be dangerous.
4513,"It was a classic pepperoni & cheese, Chicago style"
4513,oh that sounds good. I like deep dish chicago style
4513,"Ya, it was great. Ate a bit too much though which caused me to miss my alarm this morning."
4513,I've done that to myself before. Now I always wait awhile to sleep after eating.
4513,Kind of like how you should wait 30 minutes to go swimming after you eat?
4513,haha exactly. otherwise its like having a brick in your stomach overnight
4513,Well that certainly is an interesting way to phrase it. What do you eat?
4513,i like anything with a ton of veggies and dare i say pineapple on pizza
4513,"Oh pineapple, so you are one of those individuals :) "
4513,Yes i am. Its delicious and no one can convince me otherwise
4513,"Fair enough, to each their own."
4513,Thanks lol
4514,"Led Zeppelin, it was amazing! "
4514,That's awesome. Is it your favorite band?
4514,One of them. Do you like their music?
4514,"No, not really. Maybe because they are an older band that was started in 1962. That was before my time. lol"
4514,"Oh okay, I like the newer generation's music as well, what are some of your favorite bands?"
4514,"I like Green Day, the punk rock band, you?"
4514,"I do enjoy Green Day quite much, actually. A lot of the rock bands from the 90's and 2000's were pretty great"
4514,Do you have a favorite band from the 90's?
4514,I would have to say Nirvana perhap
4514,Nirvana was great. What do you think about Soundgarden?
4514,"Oh I do enjoy their music! Ahh, memories, haha."
4514,I used to listen to a little Soundgarden. Did you know the rhythm guitarist passed away last year in May.
4514,"I did not know that! That is unfortunate to hear, they played some excellent tunes"
4515,That is awesome congrats I learned about beans when I was pregnant
4515,What type of beans were your favorite?
4515,"Garbanzo,  they remind me of senzu beans"
4515,Where are senzu beans from?
4515,My favorite anime dragon ball a I collect the figurines 
4515,"oh, ha. I never watched anime dragon ball, so i didn't get the reference. "
4515,It's ok I have a giant painting of shenron the dragon with my children's name on the wish balls 
4515,That is cool. Do your kids like it too?
4515,"My sons do it's our weekend ritual, do you have any favorite shows"
4516,I want to go and visit my sister because I love to travel. But how can I save money to do that?
4516,Where does she live?
4516,"She's living in Peru right now, near Cuzco. It's such a magnificent culture there but I need to save money!"
4516,That is far away!  Maybe you could get an extra job and designate your earnings for travel.  
4516,"I see, that is a good idea. Have you traveled a lot before?"
4516,"Truthfully, I'm afraid to fly in an airplane.  But the way I drive, it's almost as fast as a plane.  I'll travel anywhere by car."
4516,That's awesome! Where is the farthest you have gone by car?
4516,Have you ever heard of Route 66?  Most people drive it in two weeks (give or take).  It took me five days.
4516,Oh my that is awesome! I have gone on route 66 in the south in Arizona and New Mexico. But I hate hot weather... prefer the cold!
4516,"Arizona and New Mexico are beautiful. But, I don't like any type of extreme weather."
4516,"Oh alright, what kind of weather do you prefer? I want to go and vacation in the Alps someday."
4516,I like something in the middle -- not too hot or too cold.  Do you ski?
4516,"I love skiing! I like to go to New Hampshire, Colorado, and Whistler in British Columbia for skiing. Have you been?"
4516,Never.  I'm so tall that every time I try to stand up on skis I fall down.  
4516,"Oh alright, it is such a fun sport! You should definitely try if you have the chance!"
4517,Do you speak Italian?
4517,"I do not speak any Italian, although I do speak perfect Spanish."
4517,"Interesting! My favorite book is the Bible. I always wanted to read in other languages to learn them, like Spanish or Italian."
4517,"I strongly believe in the bible,  it's what helped overcome my sickness when I was younger.  I suffered so much."
4517,Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. Bless you to be still on this Earth today. How the Bible changed your life?
4517,I turned to the bible during my first stages of urinary cancer.  My priest asked me to turn to the bible when I felt out of hope.
4517,What a good man. I do turn to the Holy book when I feel sad or when I'm having a hard day. 
4517,My original dream was to become a hollywood actor.  Unfortunately the disease blocked me from doing that for now.
4517,As I say to my clients when I prepare coffee : Aren't we all actors in this life?
4517,"Oh I love coffee! I need coffee right now!  And yes, we are all actors in life."
4517,I do love coffee too! I'm a barista. I never get sick to have a cup of Joe.
4517,I used to be a barista for Starbucks! Great job!
4518,"Wow, that's a lot of fish. Do you fish for fun or work?"
4518,It is a lot of fish.  I join some commercial crews but mostly just for fun.  Just that there's a lot of technology involved these days.
4518,"Yeah, I've heard that. So what do you do when you're not fishing?"
4518,Walking my dog!  His name is Bob.  He's a good guy.  He can swim but doesn't love it.
4518,I love dogs! What kind of dog is Bob?
4518,Bob is a pinscher.  He's a mix though so he's not huge like some of them!
4518,I actually have a Min Pin named Xena and my other dogs name is Bishop. They were both rescues
4518,They must be the best!  I have heard good things about the min pins
4518,"Yeah they are! Xena thinks she is a bigger then she is, hence the name Xena lol"
4518,"Xena is classic min pin!  That's right, she lives up to Warrior Princess.  Bob acts big also, but he gets terrorized by small dogs"
4519,Yes! Instantly! Had to take a very long walk afterwards... 
4519,Are you going to have her leave. Not fair to leave your own home
4519,Well that was my first thought but she has so many more acquaintances in the neighbourhood than I. So best I move on.
4519,That is probably best. Clean slate. You deserve better than that
4519,Thanks. I always wanted to travel anyways so this maybe the start of a brand new life!
4519,Where are you going first?
4519,"Good question, I think I'll just hop in my honda civic and let it take me to wherever it feels."
4519,Thats even better. Road trip it and explore the world one mile at a time. 
4519,Exactly! Any place you ever wanted to visit? 
4519,well i have been around the united states maybe maine next
4519,"Nice, that would be a fun place to travel too."
4519,"most definitely , along with the beautiful scenery"
4520,Would you consider yourself a Christian?
4520,"I am indeed a proud Christian, although I do respect other's religious beliefs"
4520,"That's nice to hear. I didn't go to church growing up, because my parents passed away when I was young. "
4520,"I'm sorry to hear that, I wasn't raised in a religious home either but found it on my own. "
4520,How old were you when you started going to church?
4520,Late teenage/early adulthood is when I began to learn about religion and joined the Christian church.
4520,I'm glad you found a community 
4520,"Thank you, that is exactly what it is. Are there any communities you are affiliated with?"
4520,"I was in a fraternity in college, but I'm not involved with anything now."
4520,"Oh that's interesting, what college did you attend?"
4520,I went to Colorado State University. Did you go to college?
4520,"Yes, I attended Southeastern Louisiana University majoring in psychology. What's your major?"
4521,I love to draw pictures of my cat.  Do you have any pets?
4521,"I actually have 3 cats, fish, geckos, snake, and a hamster.  I have a regular old zoo in here!"
4521,LOL.  That is cute.  I got the cat from my boyfriend as a birthday gift in June.  I am a Gemini.  What is your birth sign?
4521,"Oh wow, my husband is a gemini.  I am actually a Leo, center of the Universe (sun).  I love people with humor like geminis"
4521,We are a comical group.  I am a sun worshiper too.  I love the beach and sitting by my pool.  
4521,"lol  That is awesome.  I wish we had a pool, but with winter coming it is a little cold unless it is indoors"
4521,"I live in Florida, we get about one really cool week in January, then back in the 80s.  You should move south."
4521,"That sounds wonderful, it would nice to have warm weather about now.  I am up north.  But don't you get really hot in summer?"
4521,"I just stay indoors in the AC or go to the mall, float in pool, etc.  You find ways to stay cool and still enjoy the heat. "
4521,Plus you have all the beaches and disney and orlando
4521,So true.  I went to Busch Garden's Hallowscream event last night.  Awesome fun.  Always stuff to do here.  
4521,I have been to Anhizer busch up by st louis.  Grants farm it is called.  I love Halloween
4522,It turns out all the studying was worth it. I passed with an A! 
4522,That's great! I am an 8th grade teacher. So I know how important studying is
4522,That sounds fun and challenging! How did you become a teacher? 
4522,I was volunteering in a mentor program and they had an opening. What do you do?
4522,I have been working as a social worker for several years. I really enjoy helping people.
4522,That's great you love your job I am happy my job allows me to wear my favorite brand Donna Karen
4522,"That's awesome, I normally have to dress more formally for my job. Do you enjoy shopping for your favorite brands?"
4522,I was a chubby child growing up so wearing her clothes make me feel pretty 
4522,"I remember being overweight as a child as well. That was hard to deal with, especially the other kids."
4522,"Yes it's why I have a stricter no bullying policy then the school, I'm sure you are a great help in your work as well"
4522,"That is a great idea, bullying can be really difficult for children to deal with."
4522,"That is for sure, with online bullying existing now too the fight never ends"
4523,"Oh I know, there are so many different cuts - that's why I'm such a big fan!"
4523,Steak is my favorite too. The bloomin onion is also a great appetizer.
4523,"Any type of onion goes great with steak, if you ask me. So I take it you like Outback?"
4523,I do like it from time to time.
4523,Have you ever made a blooming onion at home? It's actually pretty easy!
4523,I should try!
4523,"Definitely! Like you said, it's a great appetizer and I personally like them for snacks when I'm not too lazy!"
4523,What other appetizers do you like
4523,"You know, I really enjoy spinach and artichoke dip. What about you?"
4523,That's actually one of my favorite if it is made with cheese
4523,Same! It is definitely not the same if it doesn't have cheese! I do love salads as appetizers as well
4523,"Oh, I also love jalapeno popper dip. I make that a lot"
4523,"That sounds great, I actually make stuffed jalapenos often - I imagine its similar!"
4524,"No, I hate doing that."
4524,I would have definitely complained and asked for a new order! Are you on a dietary restriction for salt?
4524,"I guess you're right! Yep, i'm trying to eat better at the moment to lose weight."
4524,I am always trying to stay active to lose weight. My dad worked at Home Depot his whole life and was super fit.
4524,"Yeah, i'm the same! Our family was and still is obsessed with sports, especially hockey. So its always been a big thing for me. "
4524,Oh that's so awesome! What is your favorite hockey team?
4524,We've always loved the blackhawks! Whats you're favorite sport?
4524,That's awesome. I like to follow the Washington Capitals. I also love American football as my favorite sport.
4524,That's great! American football is also one of our favorites too! Do you have a favorite team?
4524,"For American football, I like the Washington Redskins. But they have not been very good lately!"
4524,Awesome! And that's too bad! Let's hope they improve soon.
4524,"I hope so, it's a long season. Do you play any sports as well as watch them?"
4525,I actually started using an app that finds low gas prices in my area and give me cash back
4525,"never heard of that, does it give gift cards or cash back?"
4525,Actual cash back on your debit/credit card
4525,That's awesome. I use a lot of gas and getting cash back would be nice.
4525,"Same here, we have 5 kids. So we have a big SUV and second 4-door sedan so we both use the app"
4525,wow awesome ! i don't have kids but hopefully soon . have any hobbies ?
4525,Visiting national parks and going to live shows and performances
4525,"that's nice ! i love being outside , especially at national parks that let you fish on them."
4525,"I am not big on fishing, I don't like touching the fish or the bait lol. But being outdoors is always invigorating "
4525,yes. I love the outdoors.My work takes me to many awesome locations and I try to be outdoors as much as possible.
4525,Oh really? What do you do for work?
4525,I am a race car driver and have always had a passion for cars. 
4526,"Sometimes it is just a decision you have to make.  Deal with all the medications or just deal with a shorty hair style, or no hair at all."
4526,"Getting old isn't easy, but at least I have my grandchildren."
4526,"I began balding at a very young age, right in the center. Speaking of Jimmy Fallon, one of my grandchildren took me to see his show."
4526,"Wow, you got to see Jimmy fallon, neat!"
4526,"Yeah, one of my grandchildren is from New York and when I went to visit they took me.  It was great!"
4526,A trip to new york sounds fun.  my grand kids are 7-30 years old.  How about yours?
4526,My oldest is 22.  He just graduated from College and is beginning his family in New York.  I am so proud of him.
4526,A new family!  With great grandchildren on the way- sounds exciting!  What else did you do in NY?
4526,"I mainly stayed at his house for most of the time I was sick with the flu.  But when we did go out, we visited Manhatten."
4526,Did you visit the headquarters of the United Nations?
4526,No unfortunately I didn't get the chance to do that.  Maybe next time.  Instead I just spent a lot of time with my grandson.
4526,Its great to spend time with grandchildren - it really ignites the soul.
4527,"They called it the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" crash.  "
4527,It's a miracle that many people survived.
4527,True.  When there's a crash I think about the people who missed the flight.  That would never happen to me -- I'm always on time.
4527,"It seems like when there is improvement in airplane safety, a accident happens soon after."
4527,"I'd never noticed that, but my mom recently said the same thing, so it must be true.  She's very wise."
4527,The Boeing accidents recently is a good example of that.
4527,You're right it is.  All these accidents make me afraid to fly.
4527,"It's been a number of years since I flown, so I really don't worry about it."
4527,"I never fly for leisure purposes any more.  And for work, I either drive or take the train.  "
4527,Same here. I have a son who recently flew on business.
4527,Weren't you nervous about your son flying.  I couldn't handle it if anything happened to my mom on a flight.
4527,"I was, but I had faith everything would turn out o.k. ."
4528,I especially love watching Netflix series Stranger Things.  Have you seen that one?
4528,No but I know its supposed to be really good.  Kids in the 80s just doesn't hold much interest for me
4528,Its to story about the one kid that has unusual powers that interests me.  Anyway.  I'm just sitting here eating a salad for lunch. Did you eat?
4528,"Yes, I cooked a bit of fish and veggies for lunch"
4528,"That's better than salad.  I wanted a sandwich, but my boyfriend gave me a salad, yuck. "
4528,"Well but he got you food, so that's not a bad deal"
4528,"True.  I should be grateful.  He is wonderful.  I am still in high school, he is in college. "
4528,"Nice, does he like watching Netflix as well?"
4528,"Yes, we watch Netflix together.  I was already chosen to be valedictorian in June.  I did really well this semester. "
4528,"Wow, that's quite the honor! Good work"
4528,Thanks.  But I must keep working hard.  College is important.  I want to do well there too.  Did you go to college?
4528,"Yes I did.  I graduated early from high school, couldn't wait to get out of there"
4529,I'm asking my girlfriend tonight
4529,That's so exciting! How long have the two of you been together?
4529,a while. She's 6 months pregnant
4529,Congratulations! Boy or girl?
4529,Girl. Do you have any kids?
4529,"That's great, I have a little boy but would I love to have a little girl. Have you chose a name?"
4529,No yet. Any suggestions?
4529,"I personally like girls names that start with the letter ""P"", if that's any help lol. "
4529,I'll have to give it some thought
4529,You still have a little time to figure it out! Is there a name your soon to be fiance is leaning towards?
4529,She wants to choose a family name.
4529,It's traditional. Her side or yours?
4530,Was it Justin Bieber?
4530,"Ha, definitely not! He must have been a professional athlete or something like that."
4530,Dang Justin Bieber is my favorite artist. I would like to see him.
4530,"Maybe not naked though.  I love art, but naked justin beiber isn't the right kind of art"
4530,Ha. Very true. Do you like sports? Horse riding?
4530,I like to watch  the barrel racing at the rodeo.  I have always been a bit scared to actually get on the horse tho
4530,I love to ride any time I can.
4530,Do you go out or just in a corral?
4530,I go out.
4530,I want to go on a trip to somewhere like hawaii.  I wonder if they have horse trails there?
4530,I used to live there and they do have horse trails!
4530,I need to check those out. I've been hiking mainly for the health benefits.
4531,"Eh, it's no biggie.  I actually love stormy weather."
4531,Me too. I could sit by a fire and read all day.
4531,"Indeed.  I can definitely do that or take a nice, long nap."
4531,"Truthful, same here. What types of books do you like to read?"
4531,"Mostly books about music, art, consciousness expansion, etc. How about you?"
4531,I enjoy science fiction or anything historical. 
4531,Nice.  Same.  I like both and political as well.
4531,Do you have a favorite author?
4531,"Hmmm, that's a tough one.  I'm a huge fan of David Icke for sure."
4531,I don't think I've read any of his books. My favorite is probably Author C. Clarke. 
4531,I'm not familiar with that one.
4531,He's known for writing 2001: A Space Odyssey
4532,"Well, his school gave me a call and said that he is causing trouble in the classroom."
4532,Oh no! That could be the worst. What is your favorite activity to do with him?
4532,I know! We love playing video games together and going on hikes!
4532,My kid is strange. He likes to look up the history of things he's into.
4532,Oh he sounds like he's just curious! My boys are the same way.
4532,It can be difficult sometimes but he seems to enjoys it.
4532,How many children do you have? Just one?
4532,two teenage boys . always an adventure ! what about you?
4532,Ah teenagers! I have three young boys. 
4532,i can not imagine 3 ! what do you do with your free time ?
4532,"It's Stressful! I love the outdoors, so anything outside!"
4532,True.  It's always good to go outside with a friend.  And don't forget your towel!
4533,"Fair enough, which of her books are you planning to read?"
4533,The one about her travels through europe it's a New York times best seller 
4533,"Oh wow, that sounds intriguing. Where in Europe did she travel to?"
4533,She followed an art troupe that ended in ibiza
4533,"Really, that's pretty cool. Have you ever been to Europe?"
4533,No but next year she promises me we will go to Paris it's full of culture
4533,"Yes I agree, Paris is beautiful destination. I would like to visit there one day as well. What are some of your hobbies?"
4533,I have a weird obsession with the color yellow so I take alot of photos in sepia in my freetime. You?
4534,Yes I have an English Mastiff named Zeus.  
4534,"Oh wow, that's cool. My mom loves Mastiffs but they're a bit too big for me."
4534,What type of dog do you have?
4534,A miniature poodle! 
4534,That is a neat little dog.  Too small for my taste though as I would probably step on it or something.
4534,"Haha, it's similar to having a cat if I'm being honest."
4534,The only cats I have been around don't really want anything to do with me.  So I wouldn't know how they are.
4534,Understandable. Cats are usually pretty self-sufficient but they do make lovely pets.
4534,You have cats as well?
4534,I have two cats along with the poodle
4534,Poodles don't shed right?  Mastiffs shed a lot.
4534,"Some actually do shed, it just depends on the specific breed I suppose"
4535,You'll be ready and will do a great job as a parent - They are fun once they hit 5 years old
4535,"Yes, i just hope im a good parent to my son!"
4535,You will be!  How old is you son?  Some of my favorite times with my daughter was readying harry potter books.
4535,I don't have a son yet but I'm looking forward to when I do! I hope to have memories like that!
4535,"Now, as a teen we watch waking dead together."
4535,Oh okay! What is your favorite episode of the show?
4535,First episode - days gone by - is still my favorite
4535,Nice! That's the show where there are zombies right? I think I've seen commercials for it.
4535,Yes - its a little gory - but the story line and character development is well done.  What TV shows do you watch?
4536,How was the dinner? What was the food like? 
4536,it was good. homecooked.
4536,That sounds delicious! What are you doing now?
4536,listening to tunes bout to hunt zombies.
4536,"Zombies?! Oh, what music do you like?"
4536,anything with a good melody but im thinking about some scarface 
4536,Oh i agree! That sounds great!
4536,"yeah he ok, running for mauor of houston nowadays lol"
4536,Oh wow! He sounds smart.
4536,Yeah he aint a dummy i dont think. What you got goin on?
4536,I'm just listening to some music
4536,i imagine its some techy rave stuff huh?
4537,I use xbox
4537,"Oh cool, I am a PC game designer, I love writing RPGs. "
4537,What are RPGs?
4537,"Role Playing Games, you play team of warriors and develop them over time."
4537,Nice. How long have you been doing this?
4537,"A few years, I used to be a dental hygenist but I like this much better."
4537,Thats quite a switch.  Are you happy with the switch?
4537,"Yes, very much so. They even bring dinner sometimes so we can work longer, I can't stand broccoli but pizza is good"
4537,Cant argue with free dinner
4537,"Yeah, it's good job. I like the coding aspect too very challenging. What kind of games do you like?"
4537,Playing minecraft these days
4537,"Minecraft is a great game, I also liked Terraria which is kind of like it. They gave me a free xbox for home too"
4538,"It's was something I was really forced into, however it did give me the lifestyle I enjoy now."
4538,That is great! I was an only child and didn't get the opportunity to go into the arts. Why were you forced into it?
4538,"As a child my parents thought I was cute and talented, so they put me in commercials. My real passion is my cars."
4538,"Oh nice, that is cool. Were you able to act in any car commercials or anything related to cars?"
4538,"I stared in a movie about cars, Ferrari's to be exact. Which is why I currently have three of them. "
4538,Ferraris are great! Wow that is driving excitement! How many sports cars do you have now in total?
4538,I have a total of 10. What are some of your hobbies? 
4538,"My hobbies are watching sports, hiking, and animals - taking care of my three cats specifically."
4538,What are your cats names? I've never had a pet. 
4538,"My cats' names are Momo, Sheytun, and Alazar. They are allowed to go outside during the day and explore to their hearts' content."
4539,Yes he is . He helps me clear my mind from my math studies
4539,I love dogs. I'm mending from a broken heart 
4539,Aww did its sibling cross rainbow bridge ?
4539,No I had a broken relationship.
4539,Oh I hate those you grow with the dog as much as the person n then it's over. 
4539,i belive it.did you get a new pup?
4539,Yes and she was named kitty by the shelter I adopted her named after pride n prejudice 
4539,Thats a cool name
4539,Yeah shes a mix breed and acts like a cat at times lol
4539,lol is she a big dog?
4539,No I think part pommeranian
4539,Tiny puppy
4540,"Yes, cars definintely drive closer to the ground. Maybe I will get a new car for Christmas."
4540,That would be awesome. I'm hoping to get new gear for the lake!
4540,You really do like to fish don't you? What is your favorite lake?
4540,"I do enjoy fishing but I really enjoy water sports, especially paddle boarding  "
4540,That's cool. I tried paddleboarding once but I wasn't super good at it. I usually go kayaking instead of paddleboarding.
4540,"I enjoy kayaking too, especially in the winter."
4540,It's too cold in the winter for me. I prefer summer.
4540,I really prefer fall but I love being outdoors in almost any weather 
4540,"Fall is very nice, I like all the holidays in fall. Especially Halloween, because I beleive in magic and it is a magical time !"
4540,Indeed it is! I hope you are enjoying the season so far! 
4540,"So far so good. I can't beleive October is already over, time is really flying."
4540,"It really is, it's kind of scary when you think about it. "
4541, I want to help people as well
4541,I spend a lot of my time and money traveling and volunteering at different shelters
4541,"I see, you are doing a service to the community that is great"
4541,Thanks. It really helps me fill my time when I am not working.
4541,"I'm going to school still, S if I'm volunteering it would e only during summer "
4541,What are you studying?
4541,engneerinng
4541,Very interesting!  What type of job would you like when you graduate?
4541,"well. i would do a engineering job. Because I want to help my parents,"
4541,That's very nice. How do you want to help your parents? 
4541, want to help the financially.
4541,That should not be hard when you become an engineer.  It is a very lucrative field right now.
4542,"So, do you like the ocean?"
4542,"Yes very much. Sometimes we will drive south to Biloxi, very beautiful down there."
4542,"And, no, it's like a religious cult or something. They're pretty tight lipped about it. Makes for good stand-up material."
4542,Things are fairly conservative down here but there are also many weird cults in New Orleans.
4542,Gotcha. Does Louisiana have a beach?
4542,"Yes Indeed, New Orleans has some beaches although many people will drive into Mississippi and go to Biloxi as it is much less city like and more rural and quiet."
4542,I love it when it's quiet. It's why I go deep sea diving. What do you like to do?
4542,I also love the quiet. It's a bit weird to some but I like walking in the woods and just sitting on a log and observing nature. Very peaceful.
4542,I agree. There's nothing like communing with nature. It's where I make my best material.
4542,"Indeed, I started a new job last month and to get psyched up I sat in the woods and meditated for an hour the day before beginning the job."
4542,What was the job?
4542,I am on a marketing team for a local beverage bottling company who are trying to get a new line of soda pop on the local market.
4543,"I remember at this mexican restaurant, this band played the most beautiful guitar"
4543,My two favorite things! Mexican and Guitar. They always play beautiful music at fancy restaurants.
4543,"Since I love eating out, and love mexican, I get to hear beautiful guitar music fairly often.  What kind of things do you like to do?"
4543,I love dancing and playing the guitar! What about you?
4543,Nature - i love camping and hiking - what kind of dancing do you do
4543,All different types! I don't really stick to one specific type. I also love nature too!
4543,Do you go camping or hiking?  I've tried rock climbing but was not very successful
4543,Yes I go rock climbing regularly. It's quite challenging. Maybe you need to try again. And yes I love camping and Hiking.
4543,"I should try again. I went with really experienced folks and felt like I slowed them down,"
4543,I know the feeling! But that doesn't matter you just need to keep learning.
4543,I should - what is your best tip for getting back into it?
4543,"I normally just watch some videos on the topic, and that gets me motivated again!"
4544,He was mad because he didn't catch fish while we were fishing and he drove recklessly.
4544,What happened after you got pulled over?
4544,He got a ticket.
4544,"Well, at least that is all that happened.  Did you catch any big fish at least?"
4544,"Nope, no luck fishing and I love fishing.  I love cooking.  Do you?"
4544,"I really love to cook, I'm very good at it!  My specialty is fried chicken.  What is your favorite food?"
4544,"I love pizza, fish, and all italian food.  "
4544,.0.
4544,Actually my favorite place to eat is Olive Garden.  
4544,"I love Olive Garden, I think Carraba's is my favorite.  Have you ate there?"
4544,"Yes, we eat there twice a month.   Its part of our way to treat ourselves.  Great deals too.  Buy 3 entres get $20 off fourth."
4544,Do you have a sweet tooth?
4545,What an experience for a child to have! Is your father still a butcher?
4545,"he was , he retired five years ago . "
4545,"and what about you, what do you do now?"
4545,I am now a journalist for a newspaper. What do you do? 
4546,you got a university planned yet?
4546,"Yes, Carleton University on Ottawa. I am working at"
4546,only carleton i know of is from fresh prince for real

4546,will smith doin some kind of spinoff project 
4546,"Yes, I head that. Some kind of reboot. My hospital coworkers like to go out for pasta and then catch a movie."
4546,"cool, maybe they could start a movie channel on the patient tv's"
4546,"TVs are too expensive to rent in the hospital, most people just use a tablet on the free wifi."
4546,oh ok. im that advanced yet. im still on windows. feels like stone age lol
4546,I know what you mean about stone age. The other day I was telling a friend that my first computer was a Commodore 64. I felt old.
4546,My dad had one of those lol he made a ping pong game teaching hisself dos. he was a cnc programmer.
4546,Your Dad sounds cool. CNC programming was hard.
4547,How are you doing today?  The weather is beautiful.  I love a pretty fall day.
4547,I am doing good and yourself?
4547,Very well thanks.  I'm taking some time off from my busy job today and relaxing.
4547,It is good to find some time for ourself to rest.  I'm not working either - i go to high school
4547,"Great, what year are you?  I know high school is hard, a lot of studying and late nights."
4547,I am only a sophmore
4547,That's a good year.  You're not new anymore and  you don't have the pressure to decide yet what's next.
4547,"yea- it's not bad, I have one really good friend and we get through it together"
4547,That's all you need is one really good friend.   High school is tough!
4547,"Yea, I worry about money for college to so I tend to work quite a bit to save up"
4547,That's a good tactic.  College is very expensive.  Don't forget to apply for scholarships!
4547,Yea- I know I want to go for sure - not just sure what I should go for!
4548,I have a cat too! His name is Biggles like in the movie Dr. Evil. Cats are my favorite pets.
4548,i'm too afraid to ride them .
4548,"I would be scared to ride a cat too, you would probably get scratched."
4549,Well if you like music or people I may have just the job it's part time at the moment 
4549,That would be perfect for now. When do you think I could start?
4549,Hows this friday ?  We need help setting up for imagine dragons my favorite band
4549,"That would be really cool actually, thank you so much! "
4549,No problem we always need extra help on the big acts 
4549,"That's so exciting, you must love your job!"
4549,Some days arent so great but for the most part I truly do
4549,"I hear ya, it's like that on every job, ya know?"
4549,Yeah sometimes people just need to understand it's a job 
4549,Certainly. You won't have that problem with me!
4549,Perfect meet me at the starbucks on elm at 2pm Friday 
4549,Sounds like a plan!
4550,I agree! I love food. What's your favorite?
4550,My favorite is Indian food. I love spicy foods.
4550,I love spice too! My favorite food would have to be Italian though.
4550,I do also enjoy Italian food. The company I work for had our company dinner at an amazing Italian restaurant. 
4550,Oh that sounds amazing! Wish I had a job so I had events like that.
4550,Are you a student? Or in between jobs?
4550,I'm in between jobs at the moment. I haven't been able to find anywhere since high school ended.
4551,Yum. What are your fav toppings?
4551,"I am a pineapple or pepperoni fan. What I love about pizza is the it can be topped with all sorts of things like vegetables, meats, and condiments."
4551,I agree. I love spinach on mine but my family doesn't. Easy to just put on half
4551,I wish I could find good fresh spinach so I could make my own spinach hummus as a dip for pizza
4551,Oh that sounds so good! I think I will find a recipe. My friend lives in a big city so maybe she will have some good options for me
4551,cities have the best foods ! i love chicago pizza and burgers. What city does your friend live in? 
4551,Atlanta
4551,"If you ever come to Atlanta, you should go to the The Museum of Contemporary Art of Georgia. My professor says it's the best."
4551,"Atlanta has a lot of great Museums, I think. Mom is  school social worker so we have been to the holocaust museum"
4551,Do you like museums?
4551,Yes. I love them. Do you?
4551,"Yeah I don't go to many museums, I like artifacts though."
4552,It's always best with family! Are you going to celebrate Halloween next week?
4552,I am probably not going to do Halloween. I am anxious about meeting strangers in public so I keep away from most people.
4552,That's understandable. Halloween is mostly for kids anyway! What sort of hobbies do you partake in?
4552,I love studying earth science right now. I love nature and am studying at the University of Alabama. What are your hobbies?
4552,"That's awesome! Do you have a career in mind in your field of study? I enjoy visiting art museums in my spare time, also rock climbing and hiking."
4552,I want to be a geologist and study the environment in many places. I'll work in the petroleum industry likely. Where do you like hiking?
4552,That sounds like a fun and interesting career. I hike in the Colorado Rockies every summer. I also really love trips to the national parks.
4552,I want to explore the Rocky Mountains some day. I have heard there are so many fun hikes in the 14ers. Have you done a few of those?
4552,"Yes! I have climbed over 20 14ers to date. Once you get one on your belt, you will always want to go back!"
4552,Oh that is very impressive! Do you recommend any particular brand of footwear for hiking shoes?
4552,I would recommend LaSportiva. Most people go for full blown hiking shoes which are heavier but I prefer their very lightweight trail running shoes. You should definitely go for it!
4552,I like to wear the North Face gear often. I think lightweight trail shoes are great! Have you done other hikes outside of Colorado?
4552,"Yes, I did some hiking in the Grand Canyon and Zion National Park as well. Absolutely unforgettable! I gotta go but it was fun talking with you. All the best"
4552,Awesome. That is great and I really appreciate the advice. Thank you!
4553,whats the age of the kids you teach?
4553,third grade but I really want to eventually teach high school music classes.
4553,do you teach third graders music too or is it a different type of subject?
4553,"yep, I teach a general music class that includes all the classes into one music class. It can get crazy!"
4553,"oh, i see, definitely must not be too easy!"
4553,what is your favorite type of music?
4553,"i really enjoy a bit of all, i don't really have a favourite type as such. what about you?"
4553,"i am the same way, there is too much to choose just one.  I even play music in my free moments."
4553,oh what instruments?
4553,"i can play guitar, piano, drums, bass, and the violin."
4553,"oh wow, definitely the variety then! violin is great :)"
4553,"it was definitely the hardest to learn that is for sure, but i think it's the prettiest."
4553,"oh i agree, i love the violin. it just sounds so beautiful to be honest!"
4554,"That's a hard job, but definitely sweet!"
4554,yes i love sugery confections
4554,Me too but only once in a while for me.  I need my veggies to feel good.
4554,"true. i went vegan one time for around 6 months. i felt really good, expensive though"
4554,Yes but I do eat meat.  I find that going vegetarian I eat too many carbs.
4554,i find myself eating to much starchy stuff. but yeah protien is mandatory.
4554,Protein just fills me up more.  I have a big appetite.
4554,i do if i dont drink coffee an eat donuts all day lol
4554,Occupational hazard for sure!  I definitely need my coffee but I've cut back to just one or two a day.
4554,me: one or two pots a day lol. ive actually lessened it in the past week or so.
4554,I used to do that but it really made me sick.  I find I do much better having only 1 or 2 cups.
4554,yeah getting coffee drunk an crashin on it will mess the circadian up like nothin else i tell ya.
4555,It's pretty amazing. Definitely one of my favorite vacation spots!
4555,It's also one of my favourite vacation spots. 
4555,How many times have you visited?
4555,Only once; I don't have very much money as I don't want to work and I eat out too much.
4555,"Oh okay, well they say once is enough! "
4555,Hopefully if I find a rich wife or husband they can take me again.
4555,"That sounds lovely, also have them bring you to the Caribbean as well"
4555,"I've never been to the Caribbean! Some day, I hope."
4555,"Yes with your future, wealthy, spouse4"
4555,Do you have plans for your next vacation?
4555,"I do actually, I am planning to take a traveling trip down the coast of Western Africa to see all the beaches. "
4555,Wow that sounds like fun! What countries are you planning to visit while in Africa?
4556,many people also don't like country music but I like it.
4556,I do like some country music. But almost everyone who listens to it eats meat!
4556,haha.. I kinda agree with you on that one however there are many great meat alternatives that one can enjoy. 
4556,Are there any great alternatives for steak? That's my favorite food!
4556,Tofu steak or an eggplant steak can be great alternatives. 
4556,I
4556,Both can be enjoyed with some country music and it is good for you. 
4556,"Sorry about that. What I meant to say is that I'm a little skeptical of it since I haven't tried it, before."
4556,Ah! I understand. Small steps does it in that case.. you can start by limiting meat and enjoying your favorites once in a while. 
4556,I think I can do that. I sure do hope the meat alternatives are good. What's your favorite vegetarian dish?
4556,Eggplant Rollatini tastes amazing. 
4556,Well then I'll just have to try that.
4557,do you know what kind of law you want to study?
4557,"Copyright law. Lots of interesting issues in that field, especially in regards to the internet."
4557,That does sound like an interesting field. Several of my friends are lawyers but they do property and contract law. 
4557,A friend of mine once told me that if I was going to go into contact law the I should get used to offices with no windows.
4557,Lol! Only until you make senior partner then you get a wall of windows. 
4557,An office with windows to see the falling leaves in autumn.
4557,It is that time of year. Are the leaves changing where you are? Here they have not started.
4557,"I am near Toronto, they just started to really change last week. Like the songs says, all the leaves are brown and the sky is gray."
4557,I am all they down in Florida so we basically never get a great fall show. 
4557,"I was in FLA years ago, to go to Disneyworld. I remember the huge arena-sized flea markets."
4557,"Oh yes, Florida has so many interesting things. It is really an awesome state full of odds and ends I think."
4557,"Lots of things, but only one road in and out of Key West lol"
4558,I'll definitely have to contact them when i'm back home from trucking in the south then!
4558,I hope you catch a BIG ONE (or more) - have a great time!
4558,I'm worried that i won't find one though!
4558,Sure you will!
4558,Thank you for the support! 
4558,What part of the south are you in?
4558,"I'm a truck driver down there, so im always between different states"
4558,That must be interesting. Lots of places to see and people to meet
4558,Oh it definitely is! It pays well too. What do you do?
4558,a pet groomer
4558,That sounds amazing! I would love to be doing something like that.
4558,I love it. My dog is my best friend so hanging out with pets all day is amazing
4559,He looks too proud and he is just a businessman.
4559,I agree. I can't understand how his supporters don't see it! I guess they don't WANT to see it!
4559,well I think they like his ideas and that's why the support him.
4559,he is taking every thing away from the poor and giving the rich .
4559,That's true. I don't know why middle class people support them.
4559,Poor people are the hardest workers in america usually
4559,You are right. Trump is rich and most of his supporters are very rich
4559,it is awful i wish they would get rid of trump .
4559,true enough. But it depends on the votes of everyone. I don't like him either.
4559,"Yeah, to be honest I am looking forward to January 20, 2021 when his term is set to end."
4559,I don't thin he has faced any hardship in his lifetime and thats why he is like that
4559,Maybe so. Actually before he was president he was a television personality and businessman.
4560,Aww thanks that's so nice.
4560,"Of course, I'll always be here for you!"
4560,And I'll be there for you too!
4560,"Thank you, you're the only person I can depend on! "
4560,We all have to look out for one another!
4560,Definitely! This has been a really rough time for everyone :(
4560,But tomorrow is another day!
4560,One that I am looking forward to lol.
4560,"Well, I have to work tomorrow so I'm going to enjoy today!"
4560,I understand. I wish my family could be here for me like you are. 
4560,Friends are the family you choose.
4560,"Oh that is so true, I just wish my sisters cared like you did! I have ruined our relationships"
4561,"I do, we both live in vancouver. We are Canadian. Where are you from?"
4561,Florida currently my mom is my best friend dad not so close 
4561,"I feel the same way, I am close to my mom. What do you like to do in your spare time?"
4561,"I love hunting the latest food trucks, I found one close to my heart it makes any burrito you can imagine "
4561,There are some food trucks outside my job that I go to frequently. Mexican is my favorite. Do you like video games? That is my biggest passion.
4561,Yes sadly some of the newer releases arent as amazing as the original ie zelda
4561,"Very true. My favorite are definitely retro games, Zelda being my favorite. I still have my old consoles such as the Super Nintendo."
4561,Lol I still go to the local arcade and play galaga when I can I've held top 3 for 6 months
4561,"Haha that's awesome, i'm jealous that there's an arcade near you!"
4561,Yeah some old hippie looking dude runs it and is very knowledgable 
4561,That's cool. Any pinball machines there? Those are pretty cool.
4561,Yes one is Ghostbusters like the original with that creepy painting demon n all
4562,I've only been a few times. Yourself?
4562,I haven't been there since I was a child.
4562,Do you have any plans to visit anytime soon?
4562,"I don't, but I might if there was a fun event happening there. "
4562,For my next trip I hope to visit the resting place of Rita Hayworth in New York; she has always been the woman of my dreams.
4562,That sounds fun. Are you interested in classic movies?
4562,I love classic movies! 
4562,Nice. I watch them with my children on TV. We live in a rural area and can't get to the theater to see new ones.
4562,That sounds like fun and a good way to spend time with your family. Have you ever seen Cover Girl? It is my favourite. 
4562,"No, I haven't. Who stars in it?"
4562,Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly are the stars; one of the best movies ever made in my opinion. 
4562,Gene Kelley is fun to watch.
4563,I play the bass.
4563,i am the lead rapper. in my band.
4563,That is cool. What do you do for fun outside of the band?
4563,"I live on a farm, so I enjoy animals and gardening. What do you do? "
4563,I love extreme sports. I spend a lot of time rock climbing and bungee jumping.
4563,You must be pretty strong to do that. Where was your favorite climb? 
4563,I did a climb near Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe. That was probably my favorite. I
4563,Have you ever climbed Mount Kiliminjaro in Tanzania?  It has 3 volcanic peaks.
4563,I have never been to Tanzania but I would love to go.
4563,You should. I've been a few times and it's very impressive. I've never climbed there though.
4563,I wonder if I could skydive there. It has always been on my bucket list.
4563,What else is on your bucket list?
4564,What's your favorite convertible? 
4564,"I don't really have a favorite, but I would say I like the vintage styles a lot"
4564,Oh i agree! My German shepherds love my vintage styled one!
4564,Oh fun! How many dogs do you have?
4564,I have four German shepherds! What about you> 
4564,I have a lab and a Ragdoll cat
4564,That's amazing! I love dogs so much/ 
4564,Me too. And even my ragdoll acts like a dog. Probably why I like him. Did you grow up with pets?
4564,"So cute! Yes i did! We had a three corgi's when i was younger. As well as some smaller animals, like hamsters."
4564,"I remember having a hamster once. He was funny. I grew up with cats, a poodle and German Shephards"
4564,"Amazing! Yeah I have some hamsters now, they are so wild."
4564,We grew a frog from egg to tree frog this summer. That was fun
4565,Neither can I.. I once rescued a baby on a highway and the mother fainted after the ordeal. 
4565,Wow that's so brave of you was anyone hurt?
4565,Thankfully.. no 
4565,Good! I am glad you were able to save her!
4565,Yes.. the Adrenalin took over at that moment and even though I am not good at playing basketball I was able to catch the baby. 
4565,Wow! That's very impressive! 
4565,I know.. 
4565,"Anyway, do you also enjoy playing basketball in your spare time?"
4565,"No, I am not really good at it. "
4565,I am sure you are good at many other things though.
4565,Yes.. I am more into football to be honest.
4565,Oh now I see lol. Who's your favorite team?
4566,"oh they sound so adorable, i love pandas!"
4566,Bears are so adorable!  I always dream of seeing a polar bear.
4566,"oh agreed, they are just so cuddly and fluffy, wouldn't want to get too close to one though."
4566,I see grizzlies all the time when I am staying in my cabin on the lake. They get really close to the cabin.
4566,oh really? would you ever eat one?
4566,A bear? Never. I am a vegetarian.
4566,I am also vegetarian. Don't really hear much about people eating bear though right?
4566,I don't think so.
4566,"It's a shame people will happily eat pigs, cows and stuff but get all het up about other animals, really odd in my opinion."
4566,I agree. All animals should be treated equally.
4566,Agreed. It's a shame not everyone sees it that way.
4566,I don't necessarily have a problem with humans eating meat. I have a problem with how the meat industry treats animals.
4566,Oh agreed. Like how they keep hens locked up in cages and stuff for just the production of eggs and then meat afterwards.
4567,I work in marketing.  We have a lot of fun.  I love my teammates.
4567,That sounds like a cool job. Do you have any pets?
4567,"I do, two dogs I love to pieces.  You?"
4567,"Yes, I have a pug named percy."
4567,I love that Percy the Pug.  Mine are Wine and Cheese.
4567,That is so cute!! What type of dogs are they?
4567,Just mutts from the pound but I think some beagle and or maybe bassett hound.
4567,Aww.  I had beagles when I was growing up. Two little ones.
4567,They are cute but can be hard to manage.  My sister had a rescue beagle and he howled and barked endlessly.
4567,"Yeah, it is hard when we don't know what experiences they had before coming to us."
4567,"True.  I've been lucky with wine and cheese, they are very laid back."
4567,That is so nice. Do you take them hiking? My dog loves hiking.
4568,"Yes, but I graduate, soon! I'm super excited about it. What about you?"
4568,"No, I left school in Grade 10. My boyfriend and I had joabs"
4568,"Woah, you must be a hard worker! I often go on walks to deal with the stress of school. What do you do to deal with stress?"
4568,"Totally into sports, rollerblading, baseball, hockey in the winter. What is your major."
4568,"Physical therapy. Sports, huh? That's really cool. Which is your favorite?"
4568,"Depends on the season, and also if you consider fishing a sport. So I would say hockey and then fishing. In the summer, baseball and street hockey."
4568,"Nice! After some of your sessions you might have to come give me a visit, haha! Exercise for me is mostly just walking."
4568,"Walking is a terrific exercise, good for the joints and cardio."
4568,Definitely. And good exercise helps with your emotional state. It's why I'm so happy all the time!
4568,That is terrific. Your future patients will appreciate a happy physical therapist. 
4568,"I sure hope so! Well, have a nice day!"
4568,"I probably will, if the weather cooperates. Love to get outside but it is raining. Probably just stay in bed."
4569,I normally like to enjoy sun light.
4569,i prefer bein able to see stuff myself.
4569,I think everybody like to see stuff for them self.
4569,Nothing like having eyeballs to wintess these things.
4569,looking at the stars is good for peace of mind
4569,sometimes. ive been overwhelmed lookin an thinking about how big it is out there.
4569,Well. True it happens when you look at stars. You can't imagine how big is the universe.
4569,i like to imagine things so big that they spill out of my head
4569,Do you collect it when you spill and put it back to your head?
4569,nah im generous when my cup runs over so i let others have it lol
4569,Good for you. Keep looking at stars and do that.
4569,Its hope in a bubble is how i think of my thoughts that fall out like that lol im so lit 
4570,"A reasonable attitude. I wonder what the ghost was looking for. The cliched answer is love, but then I dn't believe in love so it must be something else."
4570,"I think the cliche is its looking for the person who killed it. As for love, its real, it just isn't special its a chemical."
4570,Different way of saying the same thing I would think. I bet the person who killed the ghost thought he was doing it for love.
4570,Maybe the ghost thinks it is in love with you! It just wants a kiss!
4570,"You're probably right! I'm not sure what got me on this tangent. But it's better to talk about ghosts than shop online, which I do too much of."
4570,"Don't feel bad, sometimes I spend several hours a day on the computer it really is unhealthy."
4570,I'm the same way. But in the modern world it is somewhat required to be online several hours at times.
4570,"Yes and it is the best way I have found to learn about other cultures, which is a great passion of mine."
4570,That is certainly more productive than shopping online! What cultures are your favorites to learn about?
4570,At this point in time it is mostly the Balkan countries in Southeast Europe.
4570,"Very interesting! I don't know the first thing about them, I should probably learn like you do"
4570,"Lazar of Serbia is a great place to start, he built an incredibly powerful empire."
4571,"I work over there, have been to scrubway? "
4571,"No, I haven't actually. What have you been doing today? I have spent way too much time shopping this weekend. "
4571,"Studying for an exam I have tomorrow, what did you shop for? "
4571,Clothes mostly. Then I stopped a restaurant for some pasta and a diet coke.
4571,"What kind of pasta? There is a great little cafe near Scrubway, that has all you can eat nights. "
4571,It was a spinache stuffed Ravioli. I'll have to check out Scrubway and visit the cafe. What is best about Scrubway?
4571,"Nothing really it's a crummy job, but since I am in school full time I don't have a lot of options. "
4571,That's too bad. Have you considered work from home positions?
4571,"I don't think I would be disciplined enough to stay at home, plus I enjoy meeting new people."
4571,I can understand that. It's not for everyone. Perhaps you can find a flexible job anyways.
4571,Hopefully. What do you do for a living? 
4571,"I work in marketing. I am able to work from home, so that is great for me. "
4572,How much practice will i need?
4572,I guess depends out quickly you catch on to tennis
4572,Thats true! I hope it doesn't take too long for me to improve! Are you good at any other sports?
4572,Not really. My kids love soccer though
4572,"Yeah, i'm the same. My kids are so obsessed with sports, its hard to play with them when im so bad."
4572,I know. I don't even know the rules for soccer very well
4572,Yeah. I didn't grow up with sports so i find it really hard to be interested in them.
4572,I didn't either. I really don't even like to watch them on tv
4572,Same! I don't understand how people can sit and watch them for hours!
4572,"No, me either. But my husband can. What hobbies do you have"
4572,"I love the outdoors, so camping, hiking, rock climbing. That sort of thing. What about you?"
4572,"I love to be creative, read and sew. I like gardening too"
4573,My son is now 7 years old. He wants to do everything all the time and has so much energy!
4573,Aww that's a great age my daughter is 7 she wants a cat for her birthday 
4573,That is great! Will you be getting her a cat then for her birthday?
4573,"We are visiting the local rescue at the end of the month to start the process,  shes very adult for her age"
4573,Sounds very wonderful. Has she played with cats before? Or any dogs?
4573,We had a foster dog but she is more an indoor kid so it works better.. are you married
4573,"That is great that she had a foster dog. I am married and my seven year old keeps us busy often, but I still go out to concerts and stuff."
4573,Ahh yes my wife is a photographer for local concert venues so I as well get to go out time to time 
4573,That's excellent. Do you enjoy any particular venues or types of music?
4573,I'm pretty open to most music but some I just cant call music .yourself?
4573,I like all kinds of music but I prefer low key concerts. I am a librarian and like things to be orderly.
4573,Yeah I'm not a fan of loud and obnoxious but one day I want to experience burning man
4573,Burning man would be excellent! I would love to go there!
4574,"Yes, having a similar experience, I agree. Drunk driving is so terrible."
4574,It is very terrible. I couldn't even return to school. I had to be homeschooled and felt very alone.
4574,How sad. Learning to cope with a disability is a challenge. Were you able to attend college?
4574,"Yes, I did go to college. I did well in the courses but very poor socially."
4574,"I'm sure people sometimes don't know how to handle people who are a little different, sometimes."
4574,That was the case sometimes but I also found it was just hard for me to connect with people because I do not have much experience with it.
4574,"It's okay to be an introvert, but if you want to get better at socializing, then practice makes perfect!"
4574,Very true. I try to push my limits and socialize as much as I can.
4574,That's very brave! Good luck!
4574,Thank you so much!
4574,I understand because I was very shy as a child! I never thought I'd graduate college.
4574,"Well, you are an inspiration for me!"
4575,I was an uncooked noodle
4575,Well hopefully the restaurant gave you some compensation!
4575,Nope i didn't really say anything.  As long as it wasn't a bug or something i was ok!
4575,"Well that's good, was the rest of the food good?"
4575,It was ok.  It's hard to find a good Chinese restaurant around here and i'm on a diet
4576,Was anything done about it by the school?
4576,I've spoken to the school about it so it's just time to wait and see for the next few days to see if anything happens from now.
4576,I really hope it get's resolved. Is she a student in college?
4576,"No, just in high school currently."
4576,Does she know what she will study or what she wants to become when she grows up?
4576,I think she wants to do business as she wants to help me build up my online business and become a co-partner with me.
4576,That's nice. So she is very entrepreneurial. 
4576,For sure! She seems to really enjoy helping me with my business so far.
4576,that's the best way to learn through experience.
4576,"Exactly, experience is essential"
4576,Hopefully she will focus on all the good stuff in her life and not let those kids get to her. 
4576,Hopefully not. She's only currently having a hard time because she's a vegan as well as i am.
4577,I don't have any experience with that. The only disorder I suffer from is lactose intolerance.
4577,I am a freelance accountant and I always need to adapt to a new working environment. 
4577,Very interesting. What types of clients do you work for?
4577,I work mostly with companies who are in the coffee industry. 
4577,Very cool. I am a coffee addict. 
4577,What is your favourite kind of bean? I get to try so many at different companies.
4577,I love anything dark roast. I have found that shade grown beans usually have the best flavors.
4577,My favourite is the Kona blend; I could drink five cups a morning if it wasn't so expensive.
4577,"Yes, better coffees do get pricier."
4577,I already drink too much; I can't imagine it's good for my OCD. 
4577,I can't imagine it is. 
4577,I usually drink three cups a morning; somedays I think I need to switch to ta. 
4578,Very interesting. I only really know about the violin. I have been playing it all my life.
4578,A violin typically has four strings.  It is played by drawing a bow across these strings.
4578,"Yes, it is. Do you play these instruments?"
4578,"Yes, I play guitar as a hobby. My oldest is a violinist, my youngest is a pianist."
4578,"Wow, a family of musicians! My mother teaches music at an elementary school so I understand that."
4578,what does she teach ? mine teaches also cello lessons ! she taught me to play too .
4578,She teaches general music. She can play seven different instruments.
4578,Wow thats alot
4578,"Yeah, she is very impressive."
4578,How long has she been playing
4578,All of her life. She started piano lessons when she was six.
4579,That's very interesting. What others things do you like to do as a hobby? I enjoy water skiing. 
4579,I like to sew and read
4579,What do you like to sew? 
4579,"I used to like to sew for my daughter, but now she is too old for cutesie clothes. Now I sew things for my home"
4579,That's very cool. Where do you sell your stuff? 
4579,"I don't sell. Just for myself, friends and family. Do you live near a lake to ski?"
4579,"Yes, I grew up near Lake Michigan, my father was a lake cop, so we could go out all the time. "
4579,That's fun. I live near a lake but in Georgia
4579,I've never been to Georgia. I have heard there are a lot of swamps.
4579,Only in South Georgia. I live in the north. Do you still live in Michigan?
4579,"Yes, I wouldn't ever leave. It's where my family moved to back in the 20s."
4579,"Wow. That's cool. I lived in Ohio until I was four, but I was meant to be Southern lol"
4580,Ahh I used to play deus ex but lately I'm battling quake it's my happy place
4580,Is that a computer game?
4580,Yeah I'm trying to take a break from diablo n borderlands and I can play from my workstation
4580,Cool. I am mostly a board gamer.
4580,My brother plays warhammer and risk he tries to get me to play on weekends but I take my fur babies for walks on weekends
4580,I mostly play Catan when I am not working.
4580,I've heard of it .. do you have any pets
4580,I do. I have a chihuahua.
4580,Aww I have a chiweenie a pomsky a corgi and 2 cats
4580,Wow. That is awesome you have so many pets. I feature my pup on my blog.
4580,Aww all mine are rescues except the cats they were my mothers
4580,I rescued mine from the Celebration Florida animal shelter.
4581,"it is very difficult, i love to read"
4581,I don't read much. I spend most of my time drinking.
4581,"oh, how come?"
4581,"If I don't drink, I am in my brain too much and think too much about the past. The alcohol helps keep it at bay."
4581,That's not healthy. You should seek some assistance to help support you out of your addiction.
4581,I'd rather just stay lost.
4581,That's really not good for your health.
4581,I know. I hope to one day care enough to stop but I am just not there yet.
4581,Can you speak to anyone about that?
4581,I have nobody. My wife died in a car crash five years ago. I am alone.
4581,Any other family or friends?
4581,Nope. That is it. Maybe we should talk about you.
4581,What would you like to know?
4582,He said whenever he isn't using it I may be able to take it out.
4582,sweet im a certified lifeguard too.
4582,"That is amazing, you get to save lives!  I bet that is an adrenaline rush."
4582,Yeah nothing like voluntering to save people.
4582,"You must the best swimmer ever, I am really not the strongest swimmer.  My form would make you laugh."
4582,lol im sure your not that bad. i helped a lifeguard when i was 11 take her test so thats how i started.
4582,"It really is that bad, but luckily I can float quite easily.  In fact I cant figure how to even stay underwater for more than a couple seconds."
4582,staying underwater while your full of air is hard. you supposed to slowly let your air out.
4582,"I have done that, but yet it still never works. I have had a lot of people try to show me.  I must just be full of air."
4582,we are full of air lol. we had to move an swim with cinderblocks when we trained.
4582,I bet that was incredibly hard!  Was it scary under water with one?
4582,Not scary. After you learn the way to move its ok. Its basically just staying calm is all. The head lifeguard trained with 4 blocks. feet an hands.
4583,I stopped working out and moved next door to a McDonald's
4583,"I see, yeah that's not a good thing. I am a diabetic so I have to watch what I eat always."
4583,That's too bad; I hope you are watching your sugar intake.
4583,I do watch it all the time with my glucometer. Are you also thinking about a diet?
4583,I keep trying but I'm an art teacher and I'm always running around town and never have time to cook. 
4583,"Oh I understand, so McDonald's is very easy. I eat at McDonald's a lot myself, more than I should."
4583,"Me too, I eat it at least five times a week. It's a good thing I like sewing my own clothes because a lot of mine don't fit."
4583,Oh I'm sorry that is the case. Do you enjoying sewing your own clothes?
4583,"Yes, I do. I can design them in anyway that I want! "
4583,Oh that's great. How much experience do you have making clothes?
4583,"I'm not very good, I have only been sewing my own clothes for about four years now."
4583,I want to learn a hobby like that. Where did you learn how to sew?
4584,Because we just have different ideas sometimes
4584,Hi
4584,Hello i live in Texas
4584,"Oh nice! Have you ever been to Texas' capital, Austin? What is good in the capital? "
4584,Ah just food
4584,I think I would like the food too. what kind of food do you like?
4585,Lol well I argue with myself more then others when a joke hasnt gone far enough
4585,really ? i tend to argue with myself . do you think a hospital visit might help ?
4585,No it just means you have a pulse most of society is so butthurt 
4585,"Oh, yes it does sound like me. Interestingly, not all humor is a joke, but all jokes are a form of humor."
4585,Yes it's just like my favorite cake mystery flavor you never know how it ends
4585,well theres only one way to find out!
4585,Yeah I bring them to parties so the joke is on them lol
4585,"Welll , IwI will bring them so you can give them your mystry cake."
4585,Well hate it or love it they cant say I didn't bring something 
4585,"Well, we need to work on your evil laugh muhaahaahaa ! ! !"
4585,Oh yes I want to be a hyvrid of vincent price and tim curry. Thoughts?
4585,That might e perfect.
4586,"I hope so, I have lots of free time since I dropped out of college."
4586,Since you will have so much free time you should start running marathons with me!  Why did you drop out?
4586,"That sounds like a good idea! But maybe we should train first. I didn't like it in college, it wasn't for me."
4586,"I didn't like college much myself either.  That's a great idea though, we will start training together"
4586,We definitely should. I think I would rather just pursue music as a career rather than do education.
4587,True. What do you think the best way to start out is?
4587,Hello!  How are you?  What kind of hobbys do you have?
4587,Hey... I'm good just enjoying my weekend. I'm pretty boring but I do like sorting my rock collection sometimes.
4587,That's cool! It's always good to have a hobby
4587,"It is, and I also like making macaroni art although I'm not very good with it and it makes me hungry. What do you like to do?"
4587,"Macaroni is great too, I like it.  I like to watch tv, how about you?"
4587,"I used to, but there aren't any good shows to watch right now. Where do you live?"
4587,I live in Minnesota.  Its getting cold here.  Where do you live?
4587,Oklahoma. It's been cold and hot but it always seems to be changing quickly.
4587,Cool!  Supposedly it will be lightly snowing this week.  I am not looking forward to that.  
4587,Yuck. I may not make it to work if it gets bad here.
4587,"Yes, me too.  And really, I don't want to go to work but I have to"
4588,I teach  music and jazz is one of my favorite  to teach. 
4588,Jazz is so beautiful and soothing .do you often go to jazz clubs?
4588,"Yes, I enjoy dancing to Jazz and go often. Do you go to any clubs? "
4588,"Yes I do, well some are bars so I can watch a game. I love Hockey! Do you like sports?"
4588,"I'm not big into sports, I do like competitive dancing."
4588,Cool. There are other things like cheerleading and gymnastics that are great to watch too.
4588,Gymnastics is very entertaining. What is your favorite team? 
4588,The Chicago Blackhawks! Such a great team.
4588,Are they a hockey team? 
4588,They sure are! Hockey is such a fun sport to watch. I like to play it too
4588,How long have you played hockey? 
4588,Since I was a kid. I don't get to play too often now.
4589,"Before joining the Orioles roster, I played baseball at Miami University. "
4589,What position did you play?
4589,I was a second baseman. 
4589,"That's awesome! I like the Orioles but I work internationally, so sometimes it is hard to follow the games."
4589,That is hard; I spent some time playing in Taiwan and found it really hard to follow the MLB due to the time change. 
4589,"That's cool, did you find the MLB rules to be significantly different than the college rules?"
4589,I found that the umpires had a much bigger strike zone in the college leagues. I found it difficult as a hitter.
4589,Who do you think will win the current Astros-Nationals world series?
4589,I really hope the Nationals win since it will be good for baseball in the DC/Baltimore area.
4589,"Yes, for sure. It will be tough because of the momentum swing in the last two games. Will you watch the games?"
4589,"Yes, I am very excited for tonight's game. Watching Scherzer and Cole pitch is a treat."
4589,"I think it will be excellent to see a game seven in Houston, if it comes down to it. That will be one for the ages!"
4590,Yes me to
4590,Would like to go to lollapalooza to
4590,"how is it? I have never been to it, but I heard great things about it?"
4590,me too. i dont know i waana do burning man and gathering off the juggaloes too
4590,when does it come 
4590,Summertime mostly i believe. never in my state though
4590,I will have to look it up to see when  and where it comes
4590,yeah they got wikipedia articles on them im sure. 
4590,are you into marathons. i enjoy and run a lot of marathons
4590,i pump gas at the marathon lol thats my exposure level to running
4590,"lol. have you heard of the all american rejects, my favorite band"
4590,i love the one or two radio songs from them im familiar with
4591,Yeah a little
4591,How about the vase? Were youy able to repair it?
4591,Nope it's broken
4591,Why didn't you put it back?
4591,Because she would have noticed
4591,"Well, it is good that she didn't notice. Maybe she never will."
4591,Hopefully not it was pretty expensive too
4591,"I imagine that it was since it was so old. The nineteenth century was 200 years ago,"
4591,Yeah i won't be able to replace it with anything like it
4591,Maybe you can find another one on ebay or some other shopping site that sells rare things.
4591,Maybe but i will probably confess and replace it with something similar
4591,That is probably a good idea. Honesty is the best policy.
4592,"It's Business Management, all most finished! "
4592,Congratulations! Any big plans for after you're done?
4592,Not really. Where I am currently working at I should be able to get a good raise. So I am excited about that!
4592,"That's great? So, do you have any pets? I've got this adorable beagle whom I really love."
4592,"Aw I love beagles! I have 3 small dogs. A pug, and 2 yorkies. "
4592,"Aren't they just the greatest? Not to big, but not too small either. Pugs are really cute, too!"
4592,They really are! One of the yorkies and the pug at getting up there in age. But still so much fun. 
4592,I'm so glad you're into dogs. What about food. What do you like to eat?
4592,I love sushi!! But I would say my favorite is pizza!! How about you?
4592,This is going to sound strange... But I really like shrimp dipped in barbecue sauce.
4592,I have never tired that! But I really like dipping my food. So I don't think I would be opposed to trying it!
4593,"It was a physics class, he took it twice!"
4593,That's understandable.  Physics is tough; I struggled  with it in high school.
4593,"I don't mind it so much, it's just that it's only offered really early in the morning; I'm not a morning person. "
4593,That would make it doubly tough.  I'm not really a morning person either.  I work better at night.
4593,"Yeah, me too! Well, on the morning person part. I don't really work at night. I have a tendency to stay up too late playing video games. "
4593,Ahh. That's where we differ.  I've never gotten into video games.  What do you like to play most?
4593,"Mostly sports games,I try to get my classes and studying out of the way What do you like to do?"
4593,I like to run.  It's calming and gives me time to think.
4593,Maybe a little exercise would help me enjoy getting up earlier. 
4593,I don't know about that. :)  I still hate getting up early.  I like to run at night when it's quiet and day is ending.
4593,Oh. Maybe I will find a running video game I can play. 
4593,"That might be fun!  Other than video games, what do you like to do?"
4594,What do you and your friends usually do?
4594,Just chilling  watching things happening and people going by.
4594,That sounds fun; I'm only 18 years old and my friends and I wish we could go to the bars and clubs.
4594,ive never been to a club.
4594,"They seem so fun, but so expensive! Since I'm saving up to buy my first car maybe it's better I can't go to clubs yet."
4594,Ya a car would be alot better
4594,What kind of car do you own? I really want a Hyundai. 
4594,I drive a Toyota
4594,Do you like it? My parents always had Toyotas while I was growing up. 
4594,Cant really go wrong with a Toyota they are pretty nice.
4594,My friend just bought a brand new Tacoma; he really loves it. 
4594,Thats cool.
4595,I know.. I was so happy to see it again.
4595,Do you remember when you dad gave it to you? I bet it's a special memory
4595,It was around Christmas. I know it was cold because I really enjoy the winter and it makes me think of my family.
4595,"That's awesome, I always remember spending Christmas morning with my family every year as I grew up."
4595,You never realize how important family time is until it's too late.
4595,I completely agree. I like to look over old photos and slideshows to see all of the old memories. How about you?
4595,Absolutely. We used to go to Wal-Mart every weekend so I go there often and think about when I was a kid.
4595,Did you ever go on family vacations growing up? We used to go to the beach every summer.
4595,We would take at least one trip every summer. Sometimes to Las Vegas and other times out east. We always drove.
4595,"I remember going to Las Vegas one year and it was so hot, but lots of fun to visit the Strip. What did you do there?"
4595,I was just a kid so I would spend time in the arcades or the big water park with my older sister. It was always really hot
4595,"I always loved going to the arcades with my dad as well. We normally stayed at the Luxor, which was always fun."
4596,"Yeah, maybe it is, but I could never say no to Nagini (that's her name!)"
4596,That is a cool name! I love french fries bit got to burn off those calories. I use a bike that you pedal with your hands.
4596,That's very interesting. I've seen a few people riding bikes like that on one of my walks with my dogs; I love those walks!
4596,I am not so graceful with walking. I once fell going up an entire flight of stairs. It hurt!
4596,"Oh no, that sounds painful. I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you've recovered."
4596,It was more painful to my ego! Lots of people saw it. I am all healed up. Do you go on walks often?
4596,"Yeah, usually with my dogs. We walk all around town. I think my lizard Nagina gets jealous."
4596,I love dogs! I have on but my family does the walking.
4596,"As long as someone is walking the dog, then everything sounds fine to me."
4596,It is! I wish I could have more time to walk the dog. But peddling the bike takes a long time
4596,That does sound pretty time consuming. I hope it's worth the effort in the end.
4596,It helps me to stay fit. I just live far from work. 
4597,I've never been to Paris.  What's the night life like?
4597,Colorful and beautiful.
4597,I can imagine.  What about the music scene?  I've heard there's always something to see and do.
4597,There is always something going on 24/7. I like the jazz cafes.
4597,"Yeah, I would enjoy that.  I love going to the jazz bars here.  "
4597,Live music is the best music in my opinion.
4597,That is so true.  Do you play also?
4597,Honestly im so tone deaf i cant tell a heartbeat from bongo drum. I just got an opinion lol.
4597,I wish I played.  At work I'm always singing along with the radio.  
4597,Me too. I wish i had a voice to make up for it. I can write poetry fairly decent though.
4597,That's cool.  What kind of poetry do you write?
4597,"Poetry to read, that rhymes on a beat if you want it to."
4598,The women who won it was later disqualified when it was revealed that she was a man. This is a big no-no in the Women-Only Butterfly Competition.
4598,I did not know that. Have you ever competed in a swimming relay?
4598,"I used to, when I was younger. But I have a young family, and my 3 r old boy keeps me too busy to swim, sadly."
4598,I have three kids as well. We are visiting my dad in Cali. My mom is dog sitting for us back home. 
4598,"Oh, you have a dog. What breed?"
4598,some kind of heeler mix. Not sure. Do you have any pets? 
4598,No - the closest thing would the little gerbil in the 1st grade class that I teach.
4598,that must be adorable . i'd love to teach .
4598,"It can be especially trying at times, but it is also very rewarding ... at times. "
4598,i'm sure it is . but i can be tough ! what grade do you teach? 
4598,"Grade one. And yes, sometimes a tough approach is neccesary. What is the weather like in Cali, are you near the fires?"
4598,"no wild fires here, thank goodness. We are close to the ocean."
4598,Sounds heavenly. Is your father enjoying the grandkids?
4599,"Right. I will never live it down, either. The old man still has it."
4599,I hear that memory isn't very accurate sometimes... maybe it wasn't as bad as I remember? Your dad is a nice guy.
4599,"Did you meet my father? Everyone loves him because of his years reading to the blind. I will admit, he does have a terrific speaking voice."
4600,"that's a long time ago for sure, I hate scary movies!"
4600,"Well I think I'm pretty interested in those, mainly I love the atmosphere and writing stories like that"
4600,I much prefer a comedy or a light hearted romance movie. Although my husband likes stories like you do.
4600,"There's a time and place for any sort of movie, not only that but a movie in that genre for everyone"
4600,Yes! I just watched a movie called Varsity Blues about sports; I love blue!
4601,"I love tacos! They're probably one of my favorite foods. Spaghetti, on the other hand, I can't stand."
4601,I dont mind spaghetti its easy and cheap to make.
4601,That's true. I should love cheap things since I just graduated high school and I'll need to start saving for college.
4601,well i hope you like instant noodles i lived on them during my college days.
4601,"Instant noodles are no taco, but I guess I'll have to cut my losses."
4601,depending on where you are going to school you should be able to find tacos i know the school i went to had a taco bar that was pretty cheap.
4601,That's pretty reassuring. I don't know if I could keep sane without weeks of no tacos.
4601,lol i feel you got to love taco tuesdays
4601,Of course! It makes getting through Mondays so much easier knowing that Taco Tuesday is coming up.
4601,usually we eat alot of asian food but this year we have been adding in taco tuesdays and i wont lie its been nice.
4601,You're so lucky! I'm glad you're enjoying Taco Tuesdays as much as I do.
4601,tacos are great they can be made in so many different ways that they cant go wrong.
4602,My hair is pretty boring and blonde but i still like to style it crazy sometimes when I'm at school.
4602,Sometimes you just have to be a little crazy. My hair is pretty wild and unmanageable on its own. :)
4602,"haha, I'm sure it has style all on its own. What else do you like to do?"
4602,I like to run.  It's a stress reliever.  Do you have any hobbies?  Or does school take all your time?
4602,"I'm pretty busy with my art school, but sometimes I like to go to car shows on the weekends."
4602,"I like to work on cars as well when I have time.  When there is a car show nearby, I like to check those out also."
4602,Sounds like we would get along well. Where do you work
4602,"I work in marketing.  It's a job, but it's not my passion. "
4602,As long as it pays the bills and lets you enjoy your life and family. I'm hoping I enjoy my career after school.
4602,Very true. What would you like to do with your degree?  
4602,I'll probably end up working in a museum. I like to create art but I'm not very good yet.
4602,That sounds very interesting.  And I'm sure you are better than you give yourself credit for.
4603,"No, I am going to a family members house. I can't handle anymore extra stress after what recently happened."
4603,"Oh that doesn't sound good. What happened, if you don't mind me asking?"
4603,"I was in a convenience store a few days ago when it got robbed, we were all held hostage."
4603,Woah that's scary. Did they end up getting caught?
4603,"Yes, luckily the police were able to take him into custody without a hitch!  And nobody was injured either!"
4603,That's good at least. The holidays will be a nice time to destress 
4603,"Oh definitely, and eat a bunch of great food, then pass out in a food coma!"
4603,I love that! Plus lots of football that day.Do you have any Thanksgiving traditions?
4603,"Yes, we always go bowling on Thanksgiving after the dinner.  One year I managed to bowl a 300 score game!"
4603,"I haven't been bowling in a while but that sounds like a great score, if I remember correctly. I typically go to a yoga class before everyone comes over "
4603,"I love yoga so much, it is a workout but also feelings like a treat for you body at the same time."
4603,It's also great for relaxing which is nice after a stressful day
4604,The only painting I can do is finger painting!
4604,"Haha. Well, who can judge art, right? Are you a fan of art as a whole?"
4604,"I like the occasional trip to the art gallery, but I'm more into nature and the outdoors.  "
4604,I think that's great! Are you a big hiker?
4604,"Thanks.  Some hiking, but mainly kayaking.    "
4604,I have gone kayaking before in New Zealand. It was a tremendous opportunity and I really enjoyed the calm of the sea kayaking.
4604,Wow!  I would love to visit New Zealand.  How long were you there for?
4604,I was there for two weeks in the South Island. I went kayaking in the Abel Tasman Sea. Have you been to that area before?
4604,"Never.  I dream about kayaking there.  I have gone kayaking in Sermilik Fjord, Greenland.  I was there for a week.  It was fantastic."
4604,Wow Greenland is amazing! Was it very cold and remote as people think?
4604,Not so cold.  The locals were very friendly.  I'd definitely recommend it.
4604,"I want to go there and Iceland as well one day. I work in finance so hopefully when the calendar is lighter, I will get a chance."
4605,Do you like animals?
4605,i love em 
4605,"I have a little poodle, she's crazy. What about you?"
4605,i have a dog 2 cats and 2 chickens
4605,Wow. that's a lot of animals. I'm happy with my Nanette
4605,ya i hit my limit i dont think i can have anymore lol
4605,Do you or your zoo like music? lol
4605,i love all kinds of music how about you 
4605,Jazz is my favorite although I like some classic rock when I'm in the mood.
4605,i love jazz in person
4605,Definitely. Live music is the best...
4605,other then in the car i generally only listen to it live
4606,Yuck. I lecture my grandkids everyday - wash your hands!
4606,"Yes, it's not healthy for others. I work out a lot so I know the gyms and locker rooms can be very dirty."
4606,"Atheletes foot would be the big one, I am guessing. "
4606,Oh yes. It's gross and contagious. Did your grandkids every get lice? With my brown hair it would be hard to see.
4606,Every kid under 10 has had lice in this city. Sometimes the stores run out of the special shampoo.
4606,yikes. I heard there are strands of lice that are now immune to the over the counter shampoo
4606,These days everything is drug resistant - except Lindsay Lohan!
4606,That's probably true and that's very funny! HA ha ha 
4606,Do you work out a gym or at home?
4606,I work out at a gym. Do you like to work out?
4606,I work out with a group of fellow grandmas in a friends basement that has been converted to a little work out area. I find gyms a bit intimidating.
4606,That's neat. Its nice that you work out as a grandma. I hope I do also someday.
4606,You wouldnt if you saw old Bertha do the splits.
4607,"I mean, sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.  I wish I had better parent support."
4607,"oh I know the feeling all to well, I'm a skeleton after working with a classroom full of Kindergartener when I get home"
4607,"What do you do to relax?  Kindergartners, I imagine, at least don't give you too much attitude."
4607,Relaxed? haha.  I never have time to relax with kids of my own at home. Did you have any kids of your own?
4607,"I have one child for whom I am the custodial parent, which is a little weird as a guy."
4607,I have a daughter and a son. Both of which have my long fingers and short stubby toes. 
4607,I don't think it matters the size of the fingers and toes as long as they are all there.  My kid is napping currently.
4607,My daughter fell asleep on the couch 30 minutes ago.  I should probably wake her up.  She isn't going to want to go to bed tonight
4607,My son doesn't really do that.  He's just happier with a nap.  He was angry he had to take one though.
4607,oh no! Angry kids are the worst. What is your favorite activity to do with him?
4607,I like Disney dance parties with him.  He's also just recently gotten into the Old Man Knick Knack song.
4607,Thats so cute! My kids love pretending it is their birthday.  They sing the birthday song all day long
4607,Thanks for talking to me.  You seem super chill.
4607,You're Welcome! Thanks for chatting
4608,what do you think would be the perfect balance between the two 
4608,lol brother. Its called pratt in the pimp game. pretend rejection in order to increase desire lol.
4608,"i wish that worked with cheese cake i pretend to not want it but it knows i want it, im totally gonna google that later lol"
4608,that would totally be a shortcut. its basic psycology to how humans are though.
4608, when i realized i drive around 300 miles a week to work like how many people even realize how much time is wasted just driving
4608,i've always been conscious of that. Gotta keep the belt tight always.
4608,sometimes it bugs me just how much time is wasted yanno but conscious sure is lovely isnt it
4608,lol i get ya. i always live within 20 minutes of my work. I will move like it aint nothing.
4608,yeah and if you account the whole women factor i wonder what the number would be for time spent chasing women 
4608,I do my best not to. The pratt plays on the selfishness and pride of the chaser so.. i aint goin.
4608,goodness are we all just doomed to continue in the cycle of psychology lmao like it almost seems we repeat alot in time 
4608,everything in creation is cyclical. an people as individuals tend towards the same type mistakes so to me its all natural. and spiritual.
4608,great insight have a good one
4609,it took weeks lol
4609,Mine took months to train forever. I was so happy when he finally learned.
4609,we still have a long ways to go but its starting to pay off
4609,Have you ever thought about training him for dog agility? Racing through an obstacle course.
4609,thats the goal one day 
4609,that's a great goal ! what do you like to do for fun ?
4609,lately we have been going to the beach to catch blue crabs
4609,"Ah yes, the documentary show on the Discovery Channel. I'd love to try crab fishing some time even though it's super dangerous."
4609,we catch the ones in the gulf its way safer and just as tasty
4609,nice! my father and I often go fishing together as he is retired and has lots of free time. What do you like to do in your free time?
4609,sleep lol
4609,I work as a home cleaner so getting a good sleep is really important. It can be hard work. It's tough on your body
4610,Why do you think that particular book inspires you so much?
4610,I enjoyed some of her major books: Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice. How about you?
4610,"One of my favorite books is Peter Pan, but books aren't all I'm passionate about.  By the way, you've confused authors."
4610,Who's the author then?
4610,Harper Lee wrote To Kill a Mockingbird.  Jane Austen wrote Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice. But no worries. We're not in English class.
4610,LOL! English is a tough subject.
4610,It can be.  What else are you passionate about other than books?
4610,"well i am passionate about a lot , i love to write !"
4610,What kinds of stories do you write?  
4610,adventure stories mostly . page turners with a lot of heart .
4610,Do they have pirates in them? I'm always craving a good pirate story-I really don't know why.
4610,No i haven't thought of that.  Maybe i'll use that for my next one
4611,Yes I've applied but got rejected due to I started drooling when I seen the dead bodies. Have you ever ate anyone? 
4611,Yuck no! Sounds like you might have. I cook with food I grow in my garden.
4611,O no i haven't but I do think about how cool it would be to be a zombie. Do you like zombies?
4611,Haven't really been interested in zombies. I like music! I teach string instruments.
4611,That is awesome. What is your favorite string instrument? 
4611,I love the violin. Such a beautiful sound. Do you have a favorite instrument?
4611,Mine is the Electric guitar. I love to play it when I'm not building boats. Do you like boats? 
4611,That is cool! I do love boats! What kind of boats do you build?
4611,Usually small row boat type ones but working to bigger ones. Do you have any hobbies? 
4611,"Just my music! I love giving lessons. So great to see others grow in their cradt, with my help of course ha!"
4611,Sounds like a very rewarding hobby. Ever teach anyone famous? 
4611,Not that i know of  lol! Maybe one of my students will become famous!
4612,It is an old book full of European bedtime stories for children.  
4612,"Oh, that's interesting. Do you like to read. I would rather play video games."
4612,"They got it because it's the same one my mom read to me as a kid.  I do love to read, but I'm a huge gamer."
4612,"that's very nice. I sometimes read when I'm waiting for duty to start. As a police officer, we sometimes have time between shifts"
4612,That is amazing! Thank you for everything you do! My father is also a police officer.
4612,"Wow, that's neat. I do enjoy it. What state did your father serve?"
4612,"In Kentucky, he would always be stuck working 11 hour shifts every single day."
4612,"Yes, it's not easy. It does feel rewarding though to serve others."
4612,"You're a very good person then, most policeman say it's a good feeling, but also bad because of all the bad you deal with."
4612,"Yes, there is a lot of bad out there. I try to still see the good in the world, I bet your dad did, too!"
4612,"Between the military and then being a police officer he doesn't see much good sadly, but he still tries to make it all better."
4612,how old is he now?
4613,The U.S. is continuing to liberate their minds and become more accepting.
4613,"I think so, although sometimes I think people are being nicer to simply avoid confrontation."
4613,"Yes, but I find that to be better than causing confrontation. Do you agree? "
4613,"Maybe, although I think if people aren't being their true selves, it will end up in a major conflict when they get sick of it."
4613,Perhaps you're right. BUT I think creating an environment where people can speak freely without fear of hatred or judgement would be beneficial. That will be a challenge though. 
4613,That's the goal and I think the world will get there eventually. Once all the baby boomers are gone with their views.
4613,Really? It's interesting that you consider baby boomers an issue. 
4613,"Not so much an issue, just a lot of old values that need to go away."
4613,"I think their values need to be re-evaluated, but not erased. Their beliefs still played an important role to the historical progress that they contributed to society. "
4613,I guess I can agree with that. I don't like it when people criticize millenialls too much though. Baby boomers didn't do that great either.
4613,"Hah, no generation does that great from the perspective of any other generation. That's just life. Are you a millennial? "
4613,You have a point. I think it's just easier to complain than to comply.
4613,"Just remember, if you're complaining, you're volunteering. Don't complain about a problem until you have thought up a possible solution. "
4614,"Yeah, graduate school can be tough."
4614,i'm sure it is . but i can be tough ! what grade are you in ?
4614,I already graduated from school. I'm planning to go back. what grade are you in?
4614,I am done school.  I would like to move to Las Vegas.
4614,"Whoo, that's so warm and dry. Have you ever lived there before?"
4614,I have not lived there but visited recently. I would like to learn self defense when I get there.  There was some pretty tough crowds :)
4614,To true. I lived in a dry climate before. But it sure is nice to have rain.
4614,I agree. I love rain.
4614,But I guess in Vegas it does rain in the winter months
4614,Yes.  Does it rain a lot where you live?
4614,It does rain a lot in Seattle
4614,I hope it turns out nice there too.  
4615,I'm so happy he did the laundry. I was baking cookies for the family and it took most of the day
4615,Those must be some cookies if they took all day. Marijuana is now legal here and everyone is talking about Marijuana cookies. Not for me!
4615,"In Mexico, it is not legal yet.  I should move to the United States. It seems like its a better culture there"
4615,DO you know Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass?
4615,"I have heard of Herb Alpert, he's a musician right?  Who is Tijuana Brass?"
4615,"A lovely bunch of very, very handsome Mexican men who play with their instruments."
4615,Oh yes! That's right.  Do you listen to them frequently? 
4615,"Yes, I have Spotify on my computer and love it. Do you have Spotify in Mexico?"
4615,Yes we do! I actually us it with my amazon echo dot while I'm baking.  Do you have an echo dot?
4615,"I do not have an echo, and stop calling me Dot. LMAO"
4615,haha! It is called an echo dot. 
4615,"Yes, I know, I was just being silly. I am usually very rational, but a joke is a joke. I hear the Echo Dots eavesdrop on unsuspecting users."
4615,Wait what? I have to get rid of that thing immediately.  Thats really weird.  It was nice chatting with you
4615,I wonder why they called it Dot. My grandmas name is Dot and maybe she should sue.
4616,Yes on my car i haven't even had for long
4616,How have you decided to handle that problem?
4616,No i can't do anything about it except be mad
4616,What do you mean you can't do anything about it-no insurance or anything to cover it? Or is it just minor?
4616,It's just minor but you can tell at certain angles
4616,"Well, at least the car will still get you where you need to go.  I'd be mad too, though.  Is it your first car?"
4616,No it's not just the nicest one i've ever had
4616,"Does it help to talk about it, or do you want to talk about something else?  What do you do for work?"
4616,i'm in finance
4616,What kind of work do you do in finance?
4616,I'm an analyst. Just review trends
4616,What do you love about that kind of work?
4617,Gambling cause also be addictive and cause you to loose everything you have.  I hope you don't have a gambling problem
4617,Not me. I knew a guy used to bet on raindrops on a window though lol.
4617,I have gambled a few times since high school. Gambling is something you can alone. My teachers said I was quiet and not socialbe.
4617,Bitcoin is my only gamble nowadays. 
4617,I'm afraid to gamble. I haven't done anything since high school so I probably need to look for a job.
4617,"lol yeah thats mandatory. Word is, if a man dont work that man dont eat. Life aint all hardness though."
4617,True! I need to eat so I better use my money (or lack of) wisely until I can find a job.
4617,yup. its all good bra havin a secured paycheck is the bomb diggity. Just dont gamble your rent money lol.
4617,No rent money-still live with the parents. That's why I need a job. Thanks for the encouragement.
4617,Sure thing. I wish it did work the other way though. Life is good just to be though.
4617,Yes sir!  I'm ready to be out on my own......so is my girlfriend!! LOL!
4617,Women make life more enjoyable. im leaving mine soon. Rather an empty house than a daily argument.
4618,Oh that is interesting. I sometimes watch documentarys about that. I like watching tv but those subjects are hard to watch
4618,"I love watching those kinds of films.  I guess you're not a hunter, huh?"
4618,"No. my dad took me hunting once or twice when i was younger. He died when I was in high school, and I never felt the urge to go alone"
4618,I'm sorry about your dad.  Must have been tough to lose him as a kid.
4618,It was and thank you for saying that. Do you have a favourite hobby you do with family?
4618,Basketball.  I coach junior league.  And I always love to watch the game.  
4618,nice. I have only watched it on tv but i think it would be cool to go to a real game!
4618,It really is.  To my mind it's the best game on earth.  What about you -- what do you like doing with your family?
4618,"We really love movies, especially horror movies. My daughter is so afraid of them but she stills wants to watch with us. I think that is interesting"
4618,Kids can be funny that way.  What's your favourite horror movie of all time?
4618,house of 1000 corpses. What about you?
4618,"Don't have a favourite horror movie.  Best movie of all time,  Dances with Wolves.  Makes me cry every time I see it."
4619,You just never know who you can trust.
4619,"Yes, no doubt about that! I do worry about privacy issues!"
4619,Not all are bad though. Just do some researching before you invest any real time or money into them.
4619,"Yeah, It's hard though internet research can often lead to more privacy problems"
4619,"So on a happier note, what's your favorite food?"
4619,Oatmeal. Maybe it's all the time that I spend with the horses
4619,"haha, could be. I like pizza myself although I have no horses to feed."
4619,What do you hope to do for work one day?
4619,I'd like to be an announcer for professional baseball but I need to start a little lower than that. and you?
4619,A stable owner. I see you have a penchant for sports also
4619,"I do, but only baseball...football or basketball are boring to me."
4619,Oh I see lol. Who's your favorite team?
4620,That's understandable.  I don't like backtalk either.  It's incredibly frustrating.
4620,I love listening to 2000s indie music when I get in those kind of moods. Very calming 
4620,"Yes, some of my favorite music comes from that time period as well.  Add a cup of coffee with the music in the background, and it's pure heaven"
4620,You're so right! What's your favorite type of coffee? I'm sometimes very picky when it comes to trying new things. 
4620,"My go-to is a hot caramel latte, but I'm adventurous and like to try many things. What's your favorite?"
4620, My favorite would have to be a classic vanilla iced coffee with cream & sugar! Gotta stick to what I know. 
4620,Nothing wrong with that - at least you'll never be disappointed!
4620,True! Where are you from? 
4620,I'm from the Midwest but moved to the West Coast for a job after college.  How about you?
4620,I'm from the South but I've always dreamed of moving out West one day! Jealous of y'alls weather! 
4620,It's beautiful when it's not on fire! 
4620,I have a friend from Arizona and she's always telling me about how Flagstaff is always on fire. I couldn't imagine. 
4621,Haha gotcha! Any good tips for kids? My grandchildren mean the world to me.
4621,"Spend lots of time with them, and keep them very busy!"
4621,I try to! I do work alot. I am a pharmacist. 
4621,That's pretty awesome! Do you enjoy being a pharmacist?
4621,I do! I love it. It is a great profession. What do you do?
4621,"I am a farmer, I love being outside!!"
4621,That is wonderful! What kind of things do you have on your farm?
4621,"I have many chickens, sheep, and many horses!"
4621,Wow! I always wanted to learn to ride a horse. 
4621,"Yes, my horses on my farm are very lovely. "
4621,Oh no! That is sad. Are they older horses?
4621,"They're pretty big horses. They are beautiful I love them so much! They are 10 years old, although their lifespan is only 10-12 years"
4622,I really need to end the relationship.
4622,"Is this a man or woman you need to lose? If it is a man, tell him you are pregnant. He will be gone so fast...."
4622,"LOL, that is a good one.  Yes, it is a man.  He can be so caring and then a big old liar the next day."
4622,Make a pro and con list. On the pro side put caring. On the con side put liar. How is his credit rating?
4622,"Good idea.  I will do that.  I think his credit is good, why?"
4622,Well a good man with good credit is hard to find.
4622,I should take advantage more often then!  Are you in a healthy relationship?
4622,"Hard to find men, I am a long-haul heavy freight truck driver. Never in one place long enough."
4622,That would be very hard.  How long are you in the road a one time?
4622,"Well, the government regulations limit us to 8 hours a day. I am on the road 3 weeks on and 1 week off. "
4622,I hope you enjoy it?
4622,"It gets lonely, at times. But at least I do not have to nag a lying husband to do the laundry."
4623,Oh no! I always hated when that happened while I had braces.  How much longer will you have them for?
4623,"I have another year left, and then I need to start saving for veterinarian school once they are paid for"
4623,"Oh that will be such an amazing job! I love animals so much, I'm working as a barista while I figure out what I want to do with my life."
4623,"that's a good idea, they make good tips I hear! I would probably chat too much; my friends say I talk when I'm not supposed to!"
4623,"I have the exact same problem, my family is always telling me I embarrass them with how much I talk."
4623,Sounds like we are a lot alike! What's your favorite drink to make?
4623,Probably just a black coffee because it is the easiest!  I've been using my free time at work to study about my new hobby.
4623,oh yeah? What's that?
4623,"Gardening, I love roses so much so I am trying to learn how to grow them, but they seem hard to keep alive."
4623,oh wow! that's neat. I think a lot of it depends on the climate. I just started to grow tomatoes myself.
4623,"Oh wow, how has that been going for you?"
4623,"they are growing so fast, I need to buy some brackets to brace the heavy stems"
4624,Do you agree or disagree with that mindset? 
4624,I completely disagree.  We will have all the essential items needed. 
4624,You think people had everything they needed during the great depression? 
4624,Yes! A lot of people survived the Great Depression.  Did you feel they had everything they needed?
4624,"I feel that humans can make due with very little. But they were not living comfortably, so no. I'd say they went without a lot. "
4624,I'm definitely thankful for what I have now and I hope we never have to experience anything like that again.
4624,"I believe that the mindset of hoarders stems from families who went without. They're afraid of loss, so they hold onto everything they can. "
4624,I agree! I'm not a hoarder but my mother who was a nurse is one. 
4624,My mother is also a hoarder and has several hundred pairs of shoes! 
4624,Wow that's crazy! I couldn't deal with that much stuff.  I prefer to be alone in a clean clutter free space
4624,"Me too, but I never struggle to find a cute pair of boots in the winter!! Haha"
4624,Well that's true! I'm always last minute shopping for an outfits when I have events to attend
4625,Yeah i wish i worked somewhere i liked
4625,Where do you work at the moment?
4625,In a finance office pretty boring
4625,Did you have to go to university for that job?
4625,Yes i guess so.  I do have a degree but it doesn't pay like it really
4625,Ah! Sorry about that. I am looking for a job
4625,Well i hope you find something you enjoy
4625,Yeah maybe open a zumba company
4625,That would be fun!
4625,Yeah I love zumba already so it will work out wlel
4625,sounds like it
4625,Yeah like you!
4626,"No, i didnt and everyday i am thankful i didn't listen to them."
4626,"I can only imagine how much that is worth today. Do you still own it, or did you sell it off? "
4626,"They are worth fortunes now. i still own about 75% of it, i sold some of it few years ago. "
4626,That was great thinking on your part. What made you decide to buy into the company back then?
4626,"Yeah, you can say that again. I could see the prospect of success in the company, my stockbroker said some great things about them too."
4626,"I've never invested my money that aggressively, most of my holdings are much more conservative, maybe I should take more risks"
4627,I lvoe Pepsico.. They make cheetos and those are my favorite.
4627,They are cool. I love them for their cheese-flavor and puff cornmeal. 
4627,Yes. They are my favorite.. Every time the commerical comes on tv I get the whole family to come watch.
4627,pepsi rocks they have great commercials .
4627,Yeah they are definitely great.. Is pepsi your favorite too?
4627,"yes it is but i like Coke better, it's flavor just hits different."
4627,Yes I agree that coke is very good. DO you like to ski in the winter?
4627,Not usually.  Been trying to a lot more lately though hbu
4627,"Yes, I love to ski it is my favorite activity ever."
4627,What do you dislike the most about it?
4627,I don';t like to fall and get covered in snow and then get all wet when IM out in the cold.
4627,The best way to avoid that is staying home and eating Cheetos! 
4628,We should play them together sometime.. I am single you know?
4628,"Sure, that would be fun."
4628,Okay... What do you do for work?
4628,I work at a bank as a loan officer.  What do you do?
4628,I work as a graphic designer.. Thanks for asking. I love my job.
4628,"Interesting, I have zero creativity.  I am envious."
4628,Ah yes it is a great art that I have> I am very proud of my work.
4628,That is great.  How did you get into it?
4628,I guess I just always had a thing with being creative and awesome with graphic design since I was a wee tot.
4628,"I wanted to be an archaeologist when I was a kid, ha.  Really far away from that."
4628,"That is very sad, you should always chase your dreams no matter what."
4628,"Well, took a course or two in college and realized it wasn't for me.  Still enjoy reading about it and museums."
4629,I would give you one if I could they are great.
4629,When I flew to Europe I met a tattoo artist and she said she would tattoo me when I was ready! I'm scared though
4629,Wow.. You should come back Europe and watch me dance sometime.
4629,"wow, you are dancer? that's really neat. What kind of dance"
4629,Any dance that gets my legs moving is the dance for me.
4629,that's cool. When I was getting my degree in business I had to take a class called the Art of Dance
4629,There is nothing that's going to teach you how to dance more than actually dancing.
4629,I agree. that's true. Maybe I will start with an aerobics class to get coordinated.
4629,"Yes, that will help you with your mental and physical health as well!"
4629,"Then, I can get really good and get a tattoo of a dancer! HA!"
4629,"HA! you are the funniest person alive, I am weak in the guy!"
4629,I may be funny but soon I will also be a good dancer! :)
4630,"Yes, rock is definitely my favorite music to rock out to."
4630,aint nothing like old school metallica
4630,"Oh yeah, you said it! I cannot get enough of that and gummy worms! They make my teeth rot."
4630,lol i stay away from candy for that reason. sourheads tho.
4630,"Oh yes, those are great. Anything that makes my teeth hurt is great for me!"
4630,thats so funny im laughing inside. you should restrain yoself lol.
4630,Yes I am very comical it must be all the rock and roll haha!
4630,emphasis on the rock? you wild.
4630,"Yeah they called me wildin rocker back in my school years, hah!"
4630,you remind me of my brother. he wild like that too
4630,Wow! I'm sure we would get a long just fine! Drink some soda and eat some gummy worms!
4630,listen to some lynard skynard an check the grass
4631,They are not very good pets.. I Would know because I have 10 of them as pets myself.
4631,Wow! 
4631,"Yes, I know it is very interesting but it is the life I choose because I love them and no one loves me."
4631,Well that can't be trues! Sure someone does! I recently moved to sweden so idk if I will have time for pets.
4631,"That is a good choice, they are very hard to feed and house every day it takes a lot of time!"
4631,Maybe in the future. Do you have any hobbies? I like to hike on glaciers!
4631,well i am very active on the city council so that's where I spend all my free time making important choices.
4631,Gotcha! Must be super busy. I just love being out in fhe world exploring. 
4631,"Yes, I would love that too if I didn't have to take care of my alpacs."
4631,What kind of things do you approve on city council?
4631,Important things like new parks and stuff like that.
4631,That must be very rewarding! I would love to do something like that.
4632,Wow.. That sounds awesome.. Is that where you want to live?
4632,"I am originally from Canada, and the only thing I know about Nashville is the Grand Ole Opry. I am positively dreading it. "
4632,Oh no. you should only live somewhere that you love with all your heart.
4632,How do you like Mississippi? Are you on the coast or up north?
4632,I am on the coast but wouldn't like to display that any further.
4632,"As an environmentalist I was heartbroken to see that big oil spill a few years ago, with all those tar balls on the beach."
4632,Yes that is somethign that brings a tear to my eye.. I love the outdoors more than I love my own children.
4632,You love something more than your own children? You are not a very good mother. 
4632,"Blasphemy! You are nothing but a rude monster who hate the discovery channel too, I bet! "
4632,Funny story: Our local paper an a picture of some tar balls on the beach and misidentified them as Barak and Michelle Obama. We were all horrified.
4632,AHAHAH!! You have me wildin! That is so funny I am crying tears. Haha! wow that's racist!
4632,"Bad photographer, needed more light exposure."
4633,"Yeah, people can be a bit taxing. I love the Zebras though, such graceful animals"
4633,why do you like zebras in particular?
4633,"They're such cool animals, very gentle yet powerful"
4633,do you think they are white with black stripes or black with white stripes? :-) 
4633,"Haha, such a good question. They actually have black skin under their coats. So what do you like to do?"
4633,"Well, my job isn't as exciting as yours, I work as an IT agent. I don't encounter zebras, only donkeys, if you know what I mean"
4633,"IT Agent? Cool, I wish I had something I could stay indoors with, I eat six eggs for breakfast to keep my energy up"
4633,"six eggs? man, you must be in a very athletic shape with so much protein!"
4633,"I do, and keeping up with the various animals. Brushing and keeping them is very physically taxing"
4633,are there any animals you are afraid of ? i would imagine that would make work hard lol
4633,"Just baboons, they're a handful, and same with the bears. They ""play"" a little rough"
4633,one's gotta have a lot of strength and courage to work (and play) with animals like that
4634,Oh wow! I love the pandas in China.  I want to visit one day
4634,"You should! I've only been once, but it's an incredible experience! "
4634,I'm slightly nervous about going.  I'm a vegetarian and my not sure about the food choices in china
4634,"It definitely limits your choices, but no differently than how it limits your choices here. Meat or no meat, it will be an adjustment to eat foreign foods."
4634,"When I visited the Dominican Republic for a vacation, I got extremely sick from the food.  "
4634,Did you ever find out exactly what made you sick? Perhaps it was also the weather and other influences combined? 
4634,"I got food poisoning. Unfortunately, the way they cook their food vs how its cook in the US varies greatly"
4634,"Wow, that's awful. I suppose you could heavily rely on fresh fruit when you travel though. Would that be a possibility? "
4634,"Yes, that could be possible. I will definitely have to do some research before I travel to china to see the pandas "
4634,I understand. I really hope your experience in China is less traumatic than the Dominican. Everyone deserves magical travel experiences!
4634,Do you have any travel experiences?
4634,"Mostly within the country, but yes. My favorite experience was my trip to Asheville, NC for my 21st birthday. And you? "
4634,My favorite was traveling to Cuba! Thanks for chatting
4635,"Yes.. She is my life.. I wish her, and I could live forever together.."
4635,That sounds wonderful.
4635,Yes.. I love technology so maybe I will create something that will make this possible!
4635,That's interesting. What do you have in mind?
4635,Nothing particularly.. It's something that would take much studying!
4635,I'm sure you will find a way. What is her name?
4635,"Her name is Abby, she is my everything and I would do anything for her!"
4635,Abby is a beautiful name!
4635,Thank you.. She is named after my.. Late mother.
4635,Nice. I am named after my mother as well.
4635,"That is very nice, what is your name, young witch?"
4635,"My name is Priscilla. What do you mean ""young witch""?"
4636,"To me it just tastes like hot bean juice to be honest, great smell though"
4636,Oh really?! I absolutely love it! What other drinks do you like then?
4636,"I'm more of a tea person myself, i drink a cup every morning with my parents"
4636,Oh i see. I preferred tea when i was much younger. Coffee gives me the kick I need now though!
4636,"oh cool ,How do you like your coffee?"
4636,"It depends on my mood, but generally I take it with a little milk. "
4636,"Milk makes everything better, from chocolate to coffee to bones "
4636,That's so true! But then I really have to have a cup of black coffee when I wake up. If i don't then i don't get my buzz!
4636,yea i hear that's necessary for many people to function. 
4636,Oh for sure. It helps because im much older. Apart from tea is there anything else you like?
4636,"Water, can't get enough of it. hbu?"
4636,"Ah, I also love water. "
4637,That’s fair. What kind of stuff do you write ?
4637,"I mostly focus on writing an exercise blog, running in races is my main hobby. "
4637,Cool my little sister just did a marathon. I’d like to it one day but I’m way out of shape 
4637,That's awesome! You can definitely get back in shape by running a small distance at first and increasing each week.
4637,I just got some vouchers for the gym near me so that’s a good incentive to start I guess. What are you up to rn?
4637,"That sounds like a great idea, it's never too late to start. I am researching upcoming races for my blog. How about you?"
4638,I have not.. Stretching a good physical health is what it's all about!
4638,"That is so true! Being a athletic in college, we stretch consistently "
4638,"Yes, it is the key to not injuring yourself.. That is truth!"
4638,I just started my freshman year in college. College athletes train a lot harder than high school athletes
4638,"Yes, training is very important.. How long do you train per week?"
4638,"I train 5 days a week. Unless we have a game, then we would train 4 "
4638,Wow.. You sound very dedicated.. I can respect that..
4638,How often do you diet?
4638,I do not diet.. I just eat whatever I want! I have been skinny forever..
4638,Oh nice! You have a great metabolism
4638,"Yes, I use to diet much more but realized it was just very unhealthy and I needed more food!"
4638,Do you consider yourself a healthy eater? I've made some lifestyle changes recently
4639,"Yes, turmoil is my middle name.. I have an eyebrow piercing you know?"
4639,Wow that is cool! I used to own a bunch of casinos so I never got piercings
4639,Wow that sounds very great.. Do you like to gamble? 
4639,I do! I have won some tournaments. I have a lot of cash to spend.
4639,Wow that must be very nice.. I just work at a coffee shop so I have no extra money.. It's hard just to get by some days.
4639,Well if I had my casinos I would hire you for sure! What is it like to work in a coffee shop?
4639,It is very hard and long days some times.. Then other days it is very slow and boring..
4639,Well you should look into a casino nearby you to see if they are hiring. Great pay and always fun!
4639,"I do not condone people spending their money is a wretched place when they could be giving it to God, who changed my life."
4639,I am not into the God stuff. I earned my cash with hard work. I do enjoy giving to hospitals for children in need.
4639,That almost sounds fake to me!!
4639,Well it is true! I have so much cash so why not use it to help those in need.
4640,"me too! Yes, it actually annoys my whole family but it's kind of addicting! :) "
4640,i don't really like playing games on the phone.
4640,Can you imagine before cell phones? My dad used to work for 11 or more hours a day without a cell. No time for games or checking texts!
4640,Seems like just yesterday smart phones didn't exist.
4640,true! How is the weather where you are? In Texas it's always hot but it has been really cold last two days and windy!
4640,"The weather has been getting cold here too, we are getting into winter gradually here in London"
4640,oh cool! I really miss winter; it doesn't exist in Texas. I used to drink hot chocolate and play in the snow. 
4640,"That's quite memorable for you, where did you grow up?"
4640,"in the US, on the east coast; Virginia"
4640,"What do you like about Virginia? I have never been, but I have always wanted to see the Blue Ridge Mountains."
4640,"they are neat, but the Rocky Mountains are much prettier. There is a lot of history in Virginia from the US, but nothing to Europe!!!"
4640,"from what i heard,its not very far from DC right?"
4641,"Because they knew how much I worked, and although I feel bad, I really didn't want to help. I work 65+ a week. I'm just tired. "
4641,Why did you feel so obligated to help?
4641,Because they're my friend. I always feel obligated to help my friends. 
4641,Friendship is a two-way street.  
4641,So you don't think I'm a bad friend? I want to help them. I just wish I didn't work so much. 
4641,"Friends help friends, but they also understand what is going on with each other. Maybe they aren't being good friends to you."
4641,"Maybe I can offer some sort of financial assistance instead. Since I can't offer my time, perhaps offering a little bit of money would still help them"
4641,"If you want to chip in to hire movers, that could be great.  But, I wouldn't feel obligated if I were you."
4641,"Maybe I'll offer to pay for a pizza and beer night. Instead of helping them move, I can offer to help them unpack on a Friday night. "
4641,"That sounds great.  If they are your friends, they should understand that you can't always help move."
4641,Thanks for your advice. It seems you've experienced this before. 
4641,"I've had a few different friends in several different similar situations.  So, I have seen this before."
4642,The work on the project was based around graphic design in regards to our magazine company. 
4642,That's  amazing! I am terrible at those things! 
4642,It just takes a lot of practice! 
4642,Thats true but having a natural ability with it doesnt hurt at all!
4642,Thats very true! Where do you work?
4642,I work at a sub shop.  
4642,Thats great! How is that?
4642,Its all right. My manager can be a witch at times but im in the process of finding another job. 
4642,Oh not good! What jobs are you looking at?
4642,Something in an office. I've worked in a camp office before and loved it! How long have you been at your job?
4642,That sounds great. Around 2 years in total so far! Hopefully I stay here for a long time.
4642,That's great! Its nice having a job that you enjoy!
4643,It went alright. Actually the most stressful part was finding somewhere to part at the client's building.
4643,Is it really bad parking?
4643,"It was just somewhere new, so I wasn't familiar with the best places to park around there."
4643,That makes sense. What do you do for your clients?
4643,"I'm in sales, so I try to sell them something."
4643,"Interesting.  I would be a horrible sales person.  I am not good at the pushing aspect an not accepting and answer of ""no.""  lol"
4643, Its tough for sure. I was lucky this time and will be meeting with them again to finalize a deal.
4643,"What do you sell, if you don't mind me asking."
4643,Mass produced furniture. I work for the manufacturer and sell to retailers.
4643,"That must be tough, but satisfying when you get the deal."
4643,"It is. This client and I both love food trucks, so I took taking them to one for lunch made them more agreeable."
4643,"Knowing what the client likes must be key to a good sale and building the relationship, for sure.  Smart of you."
4644,The only technical thing I like to do is change the channel on the tv I'm watching. What do you enjoy doing?
4644,"Well, since I joined the army, I like to travel. I do also like to binge watch shows :)"
4644,Thank you for your service! I enjoy fishing out on the lake.  Nice and peaceful
4644,You are welcome. I like fishing too! Where do you fish? 
4644,It is a little lake called lake Acworth. I take my boat out on Sunday mornings and catch dinner for the family
4644,"That's really neat. Is that in the US? IF so, what state?"
4644,Yes it is in the US.  It's in Georgia. Are you in the US
4644,"Yes, I'm in Texas; I have flown many planes over Georgia."
4644,Awesome! Were you a pilot in the Army?
4644,"Yes, I still am."
4644,I considered being a pilot but I have a family now. I don't want to be away from them too long. 
4644,"Oh yes, the military and flying is very time consuming. The world sure is pretty from above though. "
4645,I guess it makes me not a nice person. He will live. 
4645,"Neither does it make you a bad person. it's just cake, he'll understand."
4645,I will just flash him my amazing smile and all will be better. Do you like cake?
4645,"That should make him happy. i like cake,vanilla cake especially. can you bake cake?"
4645,I can bake! Do you like to bake?
4645,"No, i do not know how to bake, but i am willing to learn. What type of cake do you like?"
4645,Chocolate cake and regular with butter cream frosting. I also love fresh strawberries inside of the cake.
4645,"Yummy.  How about fresh  fruit, sch as strawberry on you cake."
4645,It is okay on top but i prefer the strawberries inside of the cake. 
4645,"I assume baking is something you really like, what other things do you like to do?"
4645,Swim. But I don't like it to be crowe
4645,"I like to swim too.Swimming is really fun and besides it, it is very healthy as it involves all muscles of the body to be engaged in movement"
4646,I think so...didn't he used to paint pictures on TV a long time ago?
4646,"Yes, he did. He is my favorite artist.  I wish they would bring his show back to tv"
4646,"I thought it was kind of mesmerizing myself, as long as a had a very pricey bottle of wine to drink while watching, LOL!"
4646,Did you know they make vegan wine? I have been vegan for a few years now
4646,you have? that's neat. My exboyfriend was vegan. Do you like it?
4646,"I love it! In my opinion, it is a much healthier lifestyle.  I can maintain my weight much better"
4646," I had a vegan meal for the first time at a debutante ball, but when I lost my diamond earring, I couldn't even eat to try it"
4646,I'm so sorry to hear that. Did you replace them?
4646,"Well, I only lost one. Haven't replaced it yet. What is your favorite vegan meal?"
4646,I make some Vegan tacos.  They are amazing.  You wouldn't know they were vegan unless I told you
4646,WOW! that's talent! What do you use in place of meat?
4646,Black beans and quinoa! It is all about seasoning. That is how you get the flavors you want
4647,I like ribeye steak!
4647,oh yea ribeye is awesome since it has the bone in the steak.
4647,"True, but not all ribeye steaks have the bone in.  Do you like filet mignon?  "
4647,yes ! or a good venison steak !
4647,"Venison, I have cooked a lot of venison - but I don't much care for it.  How do you cook venison?"
4647,i glaze the meat with some butter and set it in the oven for a bit
4647,"I like cooking steaks on the grill, I am alone a lot - so time is never an issue."
4647,agree ! helps to be alone and relax
4647,"Cooking steak on the grill, having a beer, and smoking cigars."
4647,No way!! That sounds amazing! What's your favorite thing to smoke?
4647,"Cohiba, Montecristo, or Drew Estates.  You?"
4647,i don't smoke often. sometime's love a swisher sweet.
4647,"Swisher sweets blunts are good! They have them in pink, when you have a girl."
4648,I am not into sharks. I really love the show Walking Dead. Have you ever seen it?
4648,No! Is it good?
4648,So good! The Zombies look really cool. I could probably be an extra in that show as I am really thin. 
4648,Aren't they based on comic books?
4648,They sure are! Do you like comics?
4648,"I prefer books to comics, but I have liked a few before. More like the older styles though"
4648,What kind of books do you like?
4648,I've read a few DC and Marvel ones. I prefer the superheroes
4648,Marvel is awesome! Who is your favorite superhero?
4648,I would say that Thor is probably my favorite. The older version.
4648,Cool! I love Spider-Man! Such a classic character. 
4648,He really is! I also have a soft spot for some of the villians as well. 
4649,oh yes! the league is really tough. Who is your favorite team?
4649,"Well, because I am on the Philadelphia Eagles they are now my favorite, but I grew up a Redskins fan. "
4649,That awesome! What position do you play? 
4649,Running back. Its only the second season for me so I hope to stay healthy and that we can continue to win like we just ddi. What about you?
4649,I don't play for a team. Well in my dreams I do.  I prefer racing.  My actually love lightning McQueen 
4649,"That's awesome! You said you liked Houston Astros, right?"
4649,"Yes, I love the Astros. They play later today.  My cat mater and I will be watching"
4649,I hope they win too! Houston will be very happy.
4649,"Houston is my hometown. If they win, they will have plenty of celebrations"
4649,I currently live in Austin; but live in Philly while I play for the Eagles
4649,Which do you prefer? Austin or Philly?
4649,definitely Austin.
4650,"no, he just doesn't live with us anymore."
4650,I think that would drive me crazy.. Are you two getting along ok?
4650,"yes, but you know how siblings can be. Can't live with each other can't live without each other. "
4650,Haha- so true. I'm living with my brother right now so I feel your pain.
4650,"I would move out myself but with everything that's going on, she doesn't want me to. "
4650,It's your life! She's had her time. You have to grab your life and take control! Don't let her mother you.
4650,"That's true, but can't help but feel guilty. "
4650,"I totally get it, but you are the one to answer for YOUR decisions. Start your burger business and succeed! She Can't stop you. Only you can."
4650,"Wanted to take her with me to go camping this weekend in the forest, maybe we will have a bbq. "
4650,I want to come! I can test out my new tent.
4650,and I can perfect the burger recipe. 
4650,This is a great plan.Do you think she'll come? If she does I'll bring some extra booze ;)
4651,My mother wore a hat with a Red Cross on it.
4651,"Sweet, did she work for the red cross?"
4651,She didn't but she was a nurse.
4651,"That is a good profession, what do you do?"
4651,"Thanks, I am an accountant. And you?"
4651,"I am a student at the moment, I am studying politics "
4651,Nice! I could never be in politics. I like to be by myself too much!
4651,"Yeah, elected politics is difficult, you never get any privacy. Do you have any pets?"
4651,Just a cat. He is quiet and I enjoy that. Do you like cats?
4651,"Love cats, I have a pet dog named Charlie"
4651,Charlie is a great name! reminds me of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory!
4651,That is a good movie! I am craving chocolate right now
4652,I don't have any siblings. My mother worked as a nurse for a long time so it was lonely for sure. 
4652,I'm sorry to hear you were so lonely! I do not have siblings either. I actually love just helping people in the community
4652,That is nice. I had lots of time to play my guitar though! I got pretty good.
4652,That is pretty cool. The only instrument I can play is the flute
4652,I would love to play my guitar professionally but I do not know if it will happen. Do you have any other hobbies?
4652,"Since I live in a pretty rural area, it is not much to do. Sometimes I will ride my ATV"
4652,That is fun! I wish I could learn to ride an ATV!
4652,I'm sure you could! Just a little practice going slow and you will be able to do it in no time
4652,Maybe one day I will get to try it out! 
4652,Do you have any other hobbies?
4652,I like to swim! That is an awesome workout. 
4652,I do not know how to swim.  That is one of my goals for next summer. 
4653,"I love the new car.  I'm glad to have my own, reliable transportation."
4653,I bet.  What car is it?
4653,Jeep Cherokee.  I play the drums in a band so I needed something to haul my equipment.
4653,That sounds cool.  That would be a good car for that
4653,What kind of music do you like?
4653,"I like metal, which isn't as popular anymore.  Haha."
4653,"Oh I grew up with metal.  We don't get that intense, but it's fun to play occassionally."
4653,"Yeah, for sure. Metallica is my favorite band.  I could honestly just listen to that and be fine.  "
4653,Enter Sandman!  Heck yes.  I love that sound!
4653,"Yeah, it's a great song.  It's not my favorite, but that usually the song people think of when I mention Metallica."
4653,Guilty.  That's the one I've heard the most.  What do you do?
4653,I teach and do research.  I like to cook too though. haha
4654,Like the xfactor?
4654,"Yeah, except for singing."
4654,The xfactor has singing. 
4654,"But not everyone is singing, right?"
4654,I think they do..
4654,The Voice has people from all around America. Some are really talented.
4654,"X-factor is very similar to that.. I am not into reality tv shows much, I prefer sports.. swimming, football ext."
4654,I like swimming. It's a hobby of mine.
4654,is your favorite tv show The Voice?
4654,"No, but I like it a lot."
4654,Ok.. it's strange that I just hadn't heard of it. 
4654,The Voice may not air outside of the USA.
4655,That is cool. I met my husband at work. I am a pilot for a big company. You may have heard of them they are called SoutWest
4655,I bet flying planes is really exciting! I have never flown SouthWest.
4655,It is super exciting. They are great and the rates are so cheap. 
4655,Do you get to be home much?
4655,Not too much but when I am my spouse makes me my favorite food...Fried Chicken! It is so good. Wish I could have it every night. What is your favorite?
4655,"I love fried chicken, but pork chops are my favorite. I bet you get a lot of time to read then. My favorite book is the stand, what about you?"
4655,I love to read! I like horror or suspense/thriller. My favorite is House of Leaves! It is such a trip with crazy text. 
4655,"Great pick! Steven King is my favorite, but I like books about animals too! I work for a vets office haha!"
4655,I see! I bet that is so much fun but sad sometimes too.
4655,"It can be a lot of fun, but yes it has challenges! Where do you fly most often?"
4655,Chicago. It is great because I see old friends. 
4655,I love Chicago! They have the best Pizza!
4656,"Yeah, that's pretty good"
4656,What do you like to eat?
4656,"Honestly, my favorite food is Pizza, but good pizza, not the usual pizza chain pizza"
4656,"Yeah, I agree. What do you think about pineapple on pizza?"
4656,"Honestly, I like pineapple on pizza.  I don't know why people think it's okay to put all sorts of toppings on a pizza, but not pineapple.  "
4656,I agree completely! So what do you do for a living?
4657,"They play soccer! And no, they haven't been to any state level competitions yet"
4657,Awesome! Maybe a recruiter from a good college will see them play and give them a scholarship!
4657,"Hopefully, that's what my parents are hoping for"
4657,I'm sure my parents wished I had a sports scholarship for college.  I am NOT athletic.  lol
4657,"Yeah, me neither! My brothers got all the athletic genes of the family"
4657,"I do like watching sports.  I wanted to watch the World Series, but I don't get the right channels.  :("
4657,Oh damn... have you ever watched any sports live?
4657,Yes!  Baseball!  Go STL!
4657,Nice! Do you do that often?
4657,As often as possible.  I try to hit a game somewhere when I travel.  I like visiting ballparks. Even AAA.
4657,"That's awesome, I wish I was into sports to be honest"
4657,What else interests you?
4658,I would consider myself shopping for both..
4658,I mostly like shopping during sales because it's cheaper.
4658,Yes.. I do most of the shopping in my house so sometimes the leisure goes out the window and it becomes a chore. 
4658,"I like to shop online, but for clothing, I shop in store because the sizing can be so off."
4658,oh yes I agree I like to touch what I am buying most of the time. 
4658,"I'm starting to do groceries online, but mostly for items I buy all the time."
4658,Can you buy poultry online?
4658,"I do, but I pick up in store rather than have it delivered to me."
4658,Isn't it more convenient to have it delivered? 
4658,"Yes, but I live in a townhouse, so it's just easier to pick up. No telling when I will know that the office has my package."
4658,Ah I understand.. I like meat too much so may consider online shopping for groceries. 
4658,"It's very convenient. I mostly get chicken, milk, ground beef, eggs, butter, things I buy all the time. Any really small items, I still go in store to get."
4659,"If anyone deserves it, it's her. She's a hard worker, and always covers shifts at the restaurant we work at"
4659,That is great!  The world needs more people like her. 
4659,For sure. It's always great to see people like that succeed!
4659,Will you be going off to college to?
4659,"I've been thinking about going for art, I like to draw in my spare time"
4659,"I like to dabble in art.  I have drawn some comics, but not well."
4659,"That's awesome! The key is to keep at it, I bet you're better than you think even"
4659,"That remains to be seen, but drawing does help me relax."
4659,It can be very relaxing. It has its own merit for that if nothing else!
4659,"Do you have a specialty in your art?  Stills, landscapes, portraits?  What's your favorite?"
4659,"I love to draw landscapes, I could sit outside for hours and hours on end just sketching."
4659,That's awesome. It's interesting how a drawing instrument leaves behind small particles that can create beauty.
4660,"Oh, have you been many places? I want to go to Japan. I have a black belt in karate!"
4660,Japan would be a fun place to visit!  I would never challenge anyone with a black belt lol
4660,"haha! yeah it can be fun, but I also would like Japan because I hear they have great shrimp and lobster! my favorite! What food do you like best?"
4660,Mexican food is my favorite.  I live close to Mexico but have never been there.  I would love to visit mexico though.
4660,I have been to Mexico and I love it! It's so much fun! Mexican food is great too! You should go some time soon!
4660,I have also never taken a cruise but with to someday.  A cruise near Mexico would be great!
4660,I hear there are a lot of beautiful ports in Mexico that you can cruise to! No time like the present they say!
4660,That is very true!  And with winter coming up it would be a good time to travel where it's warmer.
4660,Ain't that the truth! I don't look forward to cold weather! Maybe I should take a cruise too haha!
4660,"That's why I haven't visited Alaska yet, I'm not partial to the cold."
4660,"Yeah, me either. I bet it'd be nice in the summer though! And all that delicious shrimp and lobster!"
4660,Shrimp and lobster tastes great in tacos!
4661,"Yeah, that's what I know I'll have to do.  Doesn't mean it isn't hard though."
4661,"It's very tough at the beginning, no doubt but time heals everything. "
4661,"Yeah, that's true.  I'm sure I'll be find eventually."
4661,"Yes, you will be. You just have to keep strong."
4661,"Yeah, I'm sure you've had that experience before.  Everyone has I think."
4661,yes . it was pretty devastating . but I am here for you. We all are here for you.
4661,"Awww, thanks"
4661,You're welcome. :)
4661,that's sweet
4661,"This is just a little detour, you are young and there are plenty of fish in the sea."
4661,"Yeah, that's true"
4661,I am glad you are looking at the positive side of things.
4662,That's pretty impressive. I like to use Coors in beef stew.
4662,"that sounds pretty good, I'll have to try that later!"
4662,"I tried Guinness stew, but then I found a different stew that used any kind of beer, so I tried Coors."
4662,I was not aware that Coors beer sold its malted milk to Mars candy company. Did you?
4662,Oh wow no. I love MArs candy bar.
4663,I really enjoy a good beef wellington. Do you have a favorite beef dish?
4663,"No, but I am more of a BBQ person myself.  I love the meat that is marinated than basted with sauce"
4663,"BBQ is pretty delicious as well, and since it often also contains beef I'm a big fan of it as well."
4663,I wonder if bbq from all coast incorporate the smoky taste in their food and if they use sauces.
4663,"I would imagine so. I live on a horse ranch in the south, and our BBQ has a great smoky flavor."
4663,"Interesting! I live in the south as well, I moved here for school. Do you barbecue with charcoal?"
4663,"Yeah, wouldn't want to any other way! What are you studying in school?"
4663,I am getting my B.A. in business management. What about you? Are you a student?
4663,"That sounds interesting. I am a student too, going for agricultural studies currently."
4663,What is it that made you want to get into that field?
4663,I want to eventually take over my parent's horse ranch/farm when they retire. Felt like learning some more science behind it all may help.
4663,"Wise choice; I wanted to own a farm when I was younger, though I actually just wanted to have a lot of animals lol"
4664,It's become quite the game around here.  Tossing beanbags into a hole. Similar to horseshoes in style.
4664,Oh that sounds like fun. I recently learned it was invented as an indoor game originally back in 1887.
4664,Oh it would be perfect to play indoors.  Just keep the breakabled away from the boards.
4664,you're right. it could get dangerous with breakables around. I use to play with my girlfriend
4664,My sisters taught me.  We play it at family barbecues.
4664,oh nice. Haven't played since my girlfriend and i broke up
4664,Oh man.  I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope you're doing well.
4664,yea she left me for some dude . i deserve better !
4664,You definitely do! 
4664,its okay. i just finished training as a security guard and i cant wait to start my new job
4664,That sounds exciting and a little intense.  Security for a company or prison?
4664,Have you worked as one before? Its for a insurance company
4664,I have not.  Good luck!
4665,"My eyesight's not too bad, but I do have to wear contacts at work so my glasses don't fall into the food I make"
4665,I feel you - i have to wear contacts as well! Where do you work?
4665,"I run a small bakery, mostly cakes and pies!"
4665,This is awesome! What do you bake the most often?
4665,"I love to bake big, colorful cakes. Do you bake at all?"
4665,"I bake a lot, my son loves me baking, although I am not bothered all the time..."
4665,"It can take up a lot of time, but it could also be a fun way to bond with him if he helps in the kitchen!"
4665,Thats true and eating well baked caked made by yourself is just amazing experience!
4665,"Although they don't always turn out to be well-baked haha, I've ruined my fair share of them also!"
4665,"This is how you learn! I consider my self a smart person, but the amount of cakes I have ruined is criminal"
4665,"You've gotta be able to laugh at yourself when that happens though, and you're right, at least it helps you learn"
4665,How do you usally feel when the cake does not turn up as good?
4666,that sounds weird - I've never tried that
4666,It’s a great low impact exercise. I swim a lot
4666,do you have suitable swimwear?
4666,"No but i have leather and fur winter shoes, i also have leather belts"
4666,is it real leather? I prefer going for faux
4666,"Cool, I like those too, but they are crazy expensive, if you want a thick one."
4666,gotta love the animals! 
4666,haha good point ! do you have a favorite animal ?
4666,not in particular - I like all sorts of animals. That's why I started my own clothing line
4666,So  how about animal testing?
4666,not cool! Live and let live. Why test on animals when there are enough humans to test things on
4666,i did not think of that .
4667,I play video games and watch YouTube.
4667,Do you like to travel?
4667,"I do. I want to travel around the world, especially Japan and France."
4667,That is nice! I wish I can go to those countries
4667,I've been fascinated with Japanese culture and speak some of the language.
4667,"Learning about new cultures, people and languages are fun. I like to discover. What about you?"
4667,"Same. I want to understand the world around me, not just press my beliefs on everyone. Every culture is unique in it's own way."
4667,i agree . i don't want to settle . i just want to experience everything one in life
4667,I wish I was able to travel everywhere safely.
4667,Me too. I'd love to live in a national park or the wilderness without fear 
4667,I would have to do some serious downsizing. I think living in an RV wouldn't be too bad.
4667,"I would love an rv, motor homes are very cool, the idea of a portable house is super cool to me, as long as it has living space and amenities"
4667,"Yep, very true."
4667,Its also a lot cheaper than a boat and you can get into the shallow salt flats easy.
4668,Yes when it is slightly cool under a blanket is the best
4668,"Yeah, I like to cuddle up to my Labrador! I love dogs, but especially labs!"
4668,"I thought I would not like reading as much on my tablet, but I do"
4668,Oh it's so much easier! and you can carry so many books! Im taking mine with me this year on my vacation to Paris!
4668,Wonderful. I just took mine and loved it. Being an underliner is all I miss.
4668,Oh! Have you been to Paris? Did you go to Disneyland?
4668,Yes Disneyland and Disney World. Paris sounds great!
4668,I bet the food is going to be fantastic! I am looking forward to Disneyland too haha!
4668,I am sure it will too. As long as you do not throw up on the rides.
4668,"Oh no, I don't go on rides! I just like all the characters!"
4668,Haha sounds safe Mickey and Minnie are not harmful!
4668,"No, they aren't but they sure are cute!"
4669,It sounds magical! What color is your car?
4669,I have a white car. I was going to get a black one but they didnt have any in stokc
4669,it might be good! I read that black cars get statistically speaking into more accidents because they are harder to notie
4669,I've never heard that before but those are some crazy stats. Do you like to read?
4669,I do! I am reading all the time. How about you?
4669,I do like reading. i prefer series but havent found a good one lately
4669,"I recommend Jack Reacher, it never disappointed, besides one book about his dead father"
4669,wow. havent heard of that one but sounds similar to one i was just readin
4669,What did you read?
4669,"Lone Wolf, from 2012. It's really good"
4669,Does it have a yellow cover? I think I saw it at shop and instantyl picked it up because it had a yellow cover and yellos is my facourite color
4669,Well yellow is in between green and orange so that makes sense
4670,That sounds like a lot of fun! I bet that would be a cute date spot
4670,it is a great place to go we try to go to Disney world every year. 
4670,"Aw, that's lucky. I try to find cheap ways to have fun instead of large vacations, but one day I want to be able to do that"
4670,If I could visit any of the Disney parks around the world I would want to visit the one in Paris.
4670,"Paris looks so beautiful, definitely a dream vacation! I don't know if I'd rather do Disney or sightsee around the Eiffel tower"
4670,Why not both?
4670,I'd worry I'd end up spending too much time at Disney and run out of time to really get to enjoy anything else
4670,Ah! I understand.. Maybe give yourself plenty of time at least a 7 day vacation.
4670,"Not a bad idea! Might as well go for the full dream vacation experience if you're gonna do it, eh?"
4670,yea that's probably a smart move. i work as a secretary at an insurance agency not sure I would be able to take that long of a vacation. 
4670,"That can be tricky, it'd be nice if employers really prioritized healthy break times like that though, help prevent burnout"
4670,yeah and what if you're not happy at work it can get in the way of your success
4671,dealing with it... gonna change my diet to eating strawberries only now
4671,are you sure only that will work?
4671,I hope so! What about you?
4671,"i am not really chubby, i prefer to call myself thick"
4671,"no need to talk about this at all, I think. Any favourite food?"
4671,well i like strawberries a bit but i don't have a favorite vegetable . what do you like ?
4671,watermelon is great but not everyone likes it
4671,I LOVE watermelon...Geez- I could literally sit and eat a whole one by myself. My complexion always looks better after watermelon too
4671,watermelon is something I could always eat - even when I'm sick and don't wanna eat anything else
4671,"""Well, it is delicious when you eat it raw! Do you prefer watermelon with seeds, or seedless watermelon?"""
4671,I don't mind but the seedless ones are often overbred and not very watermelony anymore
4671,"Have you ever tried eating the rind of a watermelon after you cooked it? Apparently, it's edible, although I've never tried it."
4671,sounds yuck
4671,oh you should try it at least once . its not as bad as everyone says .
4672,I'm not very crafty.  Do you like working at a craft store?
4672,sure
4672,I wish I were more crafty I love looking at different things people have made.
4672,Me too. I usually enjoy looking at costumes and drawings of various things
4672,Do you like to travel?
4672,"Yeah, I love to travel! Although, I usually go for short stays but move a lot."
4672,I have recently gotten back from Mexico.  The beaches are gorgeous.
4672,"that's cool. I've not been there but, i love to."
4672,I used to be on swim team in college so I love anywhere around water.
4672,"Swimming is really fun and besides it, it is very healthy as it involves all muscles of the body to be engaged in movement"
4672,"Yes, it's great exercise!  "
4672,"Yes,, it's good exercise for everyone."
4673,younger! I really want them to succeed and be happy in life
4673,I love your heart. That's important. Are you a brother or a sister to them? Whats your favourite colour?
4673,"I am a brother to them! I really enjoy playing recreational games with them and i get really emotional in there! It is red, how about you"
4673,My favourite is pink! 
4673,"Hahaha, same as me! I work for a big marketing company whose logo is pink and actually all the merch"
4673,"Wow, that's pretty cool. When you add it to pink it is often associated with eroticism. I might have to rethink my wardrobe!"
4673,Do you only own pink clothes?
4673,Some. I tend to pair it with pink to give it a more feminine touch.
4673,I love the color pink! Do you wear a lot of dresses to added it even more feminine touch?
4673,"Yes, I like wearing similar colors like violet and green too."
4673,I bet you must look amazing! I love these colors and feel like modern society does not appreciate them enough
4673,I agree with that. It definitely is unique these days
4674,It's just not worth it
4674,Cheating on a paper is totally different than cheating on my partner.
4674,Have you had any experience with cheating. My father that now lives in China cheated once
4674,I saw a huge spider last week. It was scary and hairy!
4674,I wonder if it was poisonous 
4674,I don't care what kind it is. I will stay far away from them. anywhere they are.
4674,Do you like music? What's your favorite genre?
4674,"I love music in so many genres. Gospel, R&B, Country."
4674,I like those too? Whitney Houston is my favorite
4674,Omg. I love her. So sad she is gone too soon. The world misses her.
4674,Gone too soon. Who is your favorite artist?
4674,Dwight Elijah a contemporary gospel singer with a beautiful voice.
4674,Never heard of him. I can't wait to see what new music is released in 2020
4675,Family bonding is important. I enjoy spending time with my family. What type of museums do you go to?
4675,Mostly modern art! I like to paint and I thinking seeing all the paintings helps get our two boys interested in painting as well!
4675,"That's great. I enjoy painting as well, actually just order some more paint today."
4675,Oh nice! Do you like to use oil? or acrylics?
4675,I've mostly used acrylics since they tend to be less expensive. How about you?
4675,"It varies, but mostly acrylics for me too! Easier clean up for the win!"
4675,"Good point! Do you like to paint anything in particular? Like landscapes, etc."
4675,"I like to do abstract paintings mostly! The boys of course like to paint cars, go figure! Landscapes are your favorite subject?"
4675,"I wish I could paint landscapes, but I'm a novice painter and mostly do it for relaxation. So my go-to is abstracts as well."
4675,"Yeah, landscapes can be difficult! Just keep practicing and it will come."
4675,Very true and what I keep telling myself. How long have you been painting?
4675,"For about 8 years now! I have gotten much better, but still no Picaso!"
4676,any other hobbies besides that?
4676,I like to also eat large meals aside from swimming. 
4676,don't eat them before swimming otherwise you might get sick
4676,This is a good idea. I should also work on not eating so much food. 
4676,why's that? Eating is the best... equally good as napping 
4676,"I agree with that. I love to take naps too. Working out, eating, and napping is all I need. "
4676,my favourite gym class is Bounce! What's your work-out?
4676,The YMCA is my go to workout where I swim. 
4676,"I don't have too much time for working out. Studying full time, you know?"
4676,Oh I understand. What are you studying?
4676,Marine Biology - what are you doing for living?
4676,"Oh very cool. I work at an office, which is nice because it is by my YMCA. "
4677,"Extremely large, and full of these smart pieces of technology."
4677,That sounds really neat. The internet of things is great for controlling home devices and security. Do you use any of those devices?
4677,"Well, not really. I am a student, and I can't affort it right now."
4677,I am a student right now as well. What are you studying? 
4677,"Nice. Theoretical physics, what about you?"
4677,That sounds really interesting! I am studying global business strategy. What are your goals after school?
4677,Nothing in particular as for now. I would like to find a cool job I guess. Now I am working as a bartender and I really hate it.
4677,"That sounds rough, having to deal with a lot of drunk people. I am hoping to teach after I'm done."
4677,In school or at the university?
4677,I'm hoping to teach at the university level. I'm working as a teaching assistant now and it's very rewarding working with students.
4677,"Very ambitious, but what do you mean by ""rewarding""? At the university level one does not have not much contact with students, so you can't even see their progress."
4677,I think that largely depends on that type and level of class you are teaching. Smaller classes have more interaction with the professor.
4678,That's awesome!  I love comics so I recently started writing my own.
4678,That's cool! What are they about?
4678,I created this new world with a great new female superhero.  
4678,What's her super power?
4678,Her name is Annalee Mitchell and her power is healing
4678,That's fun! You don't really see too many super powers like that in mainstream comics.
4678,I wanted it to be something new and different
4678,It's definitley a fresh idea. Do you prefer Marvel or DC heros?
4678,I prefer Marvel.  My favorite super hero is Iron Man.  What about you?
4678,It's a toss-up between Thor and Star-Lord. I like how they are a little more relaxed and chill compared to everyone else.
4678,They are so funny too.  I love that they are always ribbing each other.
4678,Especially Thor in Ragnarok. Great style and good comic relief.
4678,Ragnarock was one of my favorite Marvel movies.  The actors actually improvised a lot of the lines in the movie.
4679,It was a turtle
4679,Oh awesome!  What kind of turtle was it?
4679,"A black marsh turtle, just like the ones I have"
4679,Did you name Nala after the character in Lion King?  I love that movie!
4679,"I did, I love that movie too"
4679,Me too!  I named my cat after Simba!
4679,Guess we are going to have to add more animals to finish out all the names
4679,Definitely!  So do you like the music from Lion King?
4679,I do!  I saw the Broadway musical even
4679,Wow!  I love the music!  But metal music is definitely my favorite.
4679,"Nah, no way"
4679,Lol okay then!
4680,I can't imagine what I would do if the power doesn't come back home. I would definitely miss cooking tonight's dinner
4680,Oh I hope you get to cook! Im making spaghetti sauce tonight from tomatoes I grew in my garden!
4680,Sounds good. Do you like to cook? Cooking is my passion
4680,I love to cook too! But gardening is what I really enjoy! Whats you favorite dish?
4680,"I love anything but Italian cuisine is my favorite. Pizza, pasta, cannolis are all delectable "
4680,Pasta is my favorite! But my two boxers sure do like cannolis haha! Do you have any dogs?
4680,No dogs but I do have a cat with blue eyes. 
4680,"Oh I bet they're pretty blue eyes! I love cats, but I'm allergic!"
4680,You have to be careful with those allergies. They can be deadly
4680,"Oh, I just get a little itchy and sneeze a bit, but I've heard some people have it way worse!"
4680,Oh that's good (that your symptoms are minimal). I've heard of some people being hospitalized
4680,Oh no! That would be horrible! At least mine aren't that bad! And at least I'm not allergic to dogs! Or tomatoes haha!
4680,I'm especially glad I'm not allergic to shellfish
4681,"No, but that sounds really good! If I'm ever in the area I'll be sure to check it out."
4681,"Hopefully you live in Arizona, Texas, California, Utah, Texas or Oregon because that's where their restaurants are located. The burgers and animal fries are my faves to get from there."
4681,"Yeah, I'm from Northern California, I haven't seen any up here. But my next visit to SoCal, I'll look for them. I love the beach down there!"
4681,I love California. I usually go there to visit friends when I am not busy working
4681,"I hear you. I am always busy working. That's why I enjoy home cooked meals so much, because it's rare."
4681,agreed ! sometimes a home cooked meal could not be beaten
4681,Definitely. and speaking of burgers I make a nice 1/2 pound cheddar burger with caramelized onions...so good
4681,"That actually sounds delicious! I'll have to try that some time, I could use some burgers myself right now."
4681,"I know! All this talk of food is making me so hungry! So, besides California, do you travel alot?"
4681,"Yes, I travel a lot for work. I am a dancer and choreographer so when I am not rehearsing for a show I am choreographing"
4681,"Wow, a dancer. That sounds like a wonderful job. I am not graceful enough to dance!"
4681,"A lot of people say that lol. I honestly enjoy seeing people that just enjoy dancing even when they arent they best, dance is freeing regardless of skill"
4682,yes I have two older brothers. do you just have one brother?
4682,Oh cool. I have a brother and sister.
4682,"thats cool, are you all close?"
4682,Well sort of. My brothers much older moved out and my sisters younger then me.
4682,"Gotcha, yeah since I moved out and with them working it has been hard to find time to catch up."
4682,Yea we talk every once in a while but hes cool :) Its fine you guys will catch up when you catch up. 
4682,yes very true we make it work
4682,Yea exactly. Any plans on restoring another car ?
4682,"not at the moment, hopefully I will start a new project once i'm done with school. "
4682,Nice! Hows school going for you?
4682,It has had its moments of being very stressful but for the most part I'm enjoying it. Are you in school?
4682,I can totally relate to that. Yes I am. 
4683,"Yeah, I find it really unfortunate. I just wish people could learn to love each other, y'know?"
4683,"Yes, i feel like more love instead of hate will make this world a better place"
4683,"Sometimes I worry that maybe I'm just a bit too optimistic though. I'm a lover, not a fighter."
4683,I'm the same way I'm a lover...I enjoy peaceful things like cooking and reading 
4683,Those are great hobbies! What kinds of dishes do you like to cook?
4683,I'm a pasta lover but its hard to say whats my favorite thing when i like to learn new thing all the time
4683,"Bettering yourself is always beneficial! Pasta is delicious, it's one of my favorite foods."
4683,my mother always said the more you know the better....do you enjoy cookng
4683,I do! Right now I'm actually trying to figure out what I want to cook for a date I have coming up in a few days. Any suggestions?
4684,In my practice we see children until they turn 19.  After 19 they normally change to a general practice.
4684,"In addition to a pediatrician or general practicioner, I think we should add a psychologist or psychiatrist to the mix. Especially with all the stress kids have to deal with."
4684,"I agree, children have so many more stressors in life and at younger and younger ages."
4684,"It just seems like a natural extensions of what we already have. Doctors, dentists, eye doctors, psychologist. Fits right in."
4684,"Yes, a consulation with a psychologist should be something readily available if a child has a need."
4684,I think it's best to get in front of any brewing psychological issues at a young age before they reach adulthood
4684,ok
4684,How long have you been working at your practice?
4684,I have had my practice for about 15 years but I recently joined forces with a major hospital.
4684,Do you like that better than being independent?
4684,I don't really like one better than the other but I think I will be able to help more children partnering with the hospital.
4684,I'm sure you'll have more resources available to you since the hospital is on your side
4685,Just my luck.  I need to change my diet I think anyway.  I should cut back on coffee and on meat.
4685,"Same with me, I put on 2 kilos in last month while I wasn't training."
4685,Since I like meat so much maybe I should just go with it and start a keto diet.  Have you tried that?
4685,Never heard of it. What's that?
4685,It's the diet where you limit your carbs and eat protein.  
4685,"Protein is so important. I am a baseball player - I know what I'm talking about. I supplement with vegetables, soy, beans, and others."
4685,I bet you are fit.  What team do you play for?
4685,Baltimore Orioles. What about you. What do you do for living?
4685,"Well, I'm thinking about going into investment banking.  That's what my dad does.  BUT, you don't get much exercise."
4685,I had a bad injury lastly and had a break in trainings. You're not working now? 
4685,No.  Going to school.  Sorry to hear about your injury.   Are you going to be OK?
4685,"I hope so. I'm just trying to keep positive, eat healthy and drink lots of water. Are you planning on going to a uni?"
4686,"That sounds good, my favorite is brandy and coke."
4686,Our girls night out are perfect when apple martini's are involved. 
4686,I just hope no one overdoes it and stays safe.
4686,"yah, safety first. We only have girl's night out when the kids don't have soccer games or sporting events the next day"
4686,"Glad to hear that, you know Appletinis are a fad. I never heard of them 5 years ago."
4686,They did seem to become popular about 5 years ago. They are light and don't taste bad
4686,My Father did not actually want me to drink alcohol at all.
4686,ah well as long as its in moderation. Did he say why?
4686,No but I agree moderation and do not drive and drink. Take Uber instead.
4686,Uber or Lyft is definitely the more responsible thing to do
4686,yes it is getting so easy to have fun and be responsible with just common sense and a bit of cash.
4686,"this is very true ,at the end of the day you  just gotta try to stay safe !"
4687,That seems really cool. I did not know that.
4687,The knife pattern is still very popular with collectors and is often replicated.
4687,That is interesting.
4687,I think it is. Do you have any particular hobbies or interests? 
4687,"I just graduated college, so I'm super busy with my new job. But when I do have free time, I like running or playing with my dog."
4687,"Congrats! What is your new job? I love to enjoy my free time too, I've mostly been using it to prepare for the police academy though."
4687,Thank you! I am working as an elementary school teacher. When do you begin police academy?
4687,I am starting this upcoming Summer
4687,That is fun
4687,"Yes it is :), Ive mainly been making sure I stay in shape and going to the shooting range when I can. Have you always wanted to be a teacher?"
4687,"That's awesome! Yeah, I've always wanted to work with kids."
4687,"Well I personally appreciate teachers and all they do, I know it cant always be easy"
4688,a vegan diet is a delicious means of remaining healthful while decreasing your carbon foot print 
4688,Is vegan different than vegitarian?
4688,"Vegans eat no animal products, while vegetarians don't eat animals"
4688,"Okay, that makes sense.  It feels like it significantly limits what you can eat.  I admit, I can be pretty picky with food."
4688," People typically choose these diets because of health concerns, religious restrictions or moral concerns about harming animals."
4688,I have had the desire to try and start heading towards vegetarianism.  I don't know where to start
4688,"Vegetables, fruit, grains, nuts and beans are suitable for both diets when they’re prepared correctly. "
4688,How do you ensure that you get enough protein?
4688,"it can be daunting, but nuts and seeds, soy products, legumes and grains which all vary in the amount of protein"
4688,"This has been super helpful.  I am in need of a high protein diet, and always thought you couldn't get that"
4688,t’s necessary for those on a vegan diet to incorporate a variety of food sources that are high in protein and healthy fats
4688,Would a person on a vegan diet eat soy products?
4688,it’s important to ask questions about how restaurant food is prepared before ordering it. 
4689,I am a professional swimmer!
4689,"That's so cool! I love to swim, but I am definitely not at the professional level lol"
4690,i like to hunt deer
4690,That's fun! My dogs are good hunting dogs.
4690,what kind of dogs do you have?
4690,I have a Husky and a maltese Shiz Tzu. They are my little babies!
4690,i have 2 cats that like to hunt
4690,Are they friendly or aloof?
4690,one is friendly and one is aloof and a jerk
4690,are they house cats?
4690,inside and outside cats.  I like to post pics of them on Instagram with hunting pics
4690,That sounds great.  What do they like to do in the yard?
4690,hunt lizards
4690,that sounds like a dangerous hobby . are you hunting them ?
4691,"I think I did pretty well, but it was definitely stressful! It was definitely nice to go home and relax after though."
4691,I bet im so shy and sot spoken i would have died lol..At least you can relax now
4691,It took me a long time to be comfortable-ish in front of people! My pets at home are a big stress reliver luckily. Do you have any pets?
4691,No. I just started looking into getting a dog my son just turned 1 so i figure it be a good age
4691,"That sounds like a great idea! Then he could grow up with the puppy, that would be super cute. I'm sure they would bond really well."
4691,Yes i keep reading dogs are really good protectors 
4691,They definitely can be. Is there a certain breed you're looking into?
4691,I'm loving grant dane right now but im not sure 
4691,"Great danes are great dogs, all of the ones I'm had the pleasure of interacting with are lovely gentle giants!"
4691,do you have a dog?
4691,"I do, I have two pembroke welsh corigs. They're little, but they have big personalities!"
4691,omg i saw a picture of them but never knew the name they are some cute dogs 
4692,I work full time as a real estate agent
4692,"Interesting, How much dou you earn?"
4692,It depends on the year. But I keep 90% of my commission. Much better than at bigger firms.
4692,"Wow, that trully is a lot. You must be rich."
4692,"I wouldn't say I'm rich, but I make a decent amount. Do you work?"
4692,"Yep, for a charity. It isn't much, but enough for me and my cat."
4692,Cats are the best! We have three right now.
4692,They are the best right? Mine is named Mater. What about yours?
4692,"Ghost, Luna, and Rory. They are all nuts"
4692,I love the names. Is Ghost somehow connected to the direwolf from GoT?
4692,No that was a coincidence. He already had the name when we adopted him.
4692,How sweet of you to adopt a cat. Have you got any other animals?
4693,Hoe often do you play soccer?
4693,I play rarely now but always want that excercise.
4693,All the running is definitely good cardio
4693,Yes! Not only is it cardio but it is also good for your mental state.
4693,Do you play any other sports?
4693,nope i don't . would not mind a dog to play soccer with though. But I love experiment cooking.
4693,Dogs are so much fun. 
4693,"they truly are . one of these days , i'm going to have to learn how to cook . Try Microwave Chips."
4693,What are those like?
4693,Regular potato chips in oil and cook in the Microwave totally in 5 minutes.
4693,Those sound good. I'll have to try those
4693,You should - there are loads of recipes online and it tastes so much better than store bought.
4693,Any other specialties or recipes?
4694,What's it's name?
4694,"His name is Soleil, it is french for sun."
4694,I like that.  How long have you had him?
4694,"Almost 8 years old, he is kind of old, he likes watching the sunset with me. "
4694,My pets do too.  I have a beautiful west window.
4694,"I like sunsets, but it don't see them often, I work too much. "
4694,I work from home and my pets keep me company.
4694,"I don't know if it would be a good idea for me, I already work 60 hours per week."
4694,That is a lot of hours. Working from homr is great I get to watch the sunset every day.
4694,"You are lucky, what kind of work do you do ?"
4694,I do computer programming.  It is perfect for working from home.  What kind of work do you do?
4694,"I am a lawyer, most of the 60 hours I work is meeting clients. "
4694,Are you a trial lawyer?  I think that kind of work is exciting.
4695,"I like spaghetti also.  I like it with a lot of vegetables.  Onions, garlic, and bell peppers make it extra tasty."
4695,I love spaghetti myself! I'm not a good cook at all though. I'm always eating out.
4695,"I like eating out, but it gets expensive.  I've learned a lot about cooking online."
4695,Yeah that's very true. But it is much easier than learning to cook myself.
4695,"That's true.  I've learned to grow vegetables and fruits in my greenhouse, but still not great at it."
4695,See. I'm not a great cook and I do not have a green thumb.
4695,I am a novice at both lol.  But learning more and getting better.  Lots of great information online.
4695,"they truly are . one of these days , i'm going to have to learn how to cook ."
4695,I highly suggest it!  It will also open you up to new kinds of food you may not have tried before.
4695,Food is the gateway to life.
4695,And the gateway to better health and a happy life!
4695,You are correct sir. The road to true happiness is paved with Italian sauce and cheese.
4696,I like to use uber eats or doordash to order food late at night when I don't want to go out. 
4696,i've never used uber .
4696,It's the best! It can get pricey at times. 
4696,What about doordash?
4696,They have great deals on different restaurants but it can also get pricey. I only use them if i'm being lazy.
4696,That's nice. What food do you like?
4696,"I like to order Mexican food.  What about you, what food would you order?"
4696,"I love Mexican, too!"
4696,It's so good! Especially in New York you can get all kinds of food. 
4696,Have you ever had the Mexican street food?
4696,Yes I have! The street food is the best. 
4696,Yes it is!
4697,That's interesting.  How long have you been taking martial arts
4697,It's been about 10 years now that I have been in Karate classes. I'm a 2nd degree black belt. What about you? What are your hobbies?
4697,I am an avid fisherman and can listen to classic radio shows for hours
4697,"That sounds like fun! Speaking of fisherman, my last painting was of a fisherman off the coast of Maine. I love to paint."
4697,"That's cool.  I've never been very artistic, except in music, but I can't paint or draw or anything like that"
4697,"Haha. Well, who can judge art, right?"
4697,"LOL...good point, but if I did any art, you would probably think a 3 year old did it."
4697,You mentioned music. Do you have a band or make your own music?
4697,"Nope, no band, but I did sing on an album in the past.  Now I sing in the shower or in the car"
4697,"I tried learning guitar, but just couldnt get it"
4697,I did try the violin back when I was a kid.  I was asked to stop.  LOL
4697,"Sounds like me when I try to sing! ""Who is strangling the cat?!"""
4698,No I have a 6 year daughter as well. Do you have any children?
4698,I have two kids who are grown.  I recommend getting a good Apple phone for the camera.  You will want to take lots of pictures.
4698,I agree. I actually have an iPhone now. Takes great pictures. I love taking pictures of lakes. 
4698,I wouldn't have any other phone myself.  We live near two huge man made lakes.  The area is beautiful.
4698,Wow that sounds awesome. What kind of music do you like to listen to?
4698,I really like Gary Numan.  It sounds really good on my iPhone.   Who do you listen to?
4698,I live to listen to Beyonce on my Spotify app on my iPhone. 
4698,Beyonce is wonderful.  She's very talented.  Do you think your children will like the same music?
4698,I hope so. There is so much music I want them to know. What kind of music did your children like to listen to when they were younger?
4698,Mine liked Barney the purple dinosaur.  He's not around now though.  Fun times!
4698,I know. I remember Barney. Barney was my favorite to when I was a child. 
4698,We knew every song by heart.  They played the tapes over and over and over.  We enjoyed him.
4699,Personally I prefer to travel
4699,"I love traveling, also. Where would you like to go?"
4699,"Somewhere with a lot of natural beauty, forests, mountains etc."
4699,You would be surprised by how much of that you could find in Mexico. Mountains are beautiful there.
4699,"Sounds great, any good Mexican baking recipes you could recommend?"
4699,Tamales are a must but those are best steamed. I guess enchiladas would be my favorite. I like green and red. 
4699,"Sounds good, I should try those if I get a chance to visit Mexico, there so much green there I'm sure I would love it."
4699,"Absolutely, and blue also. The ocean seems to be everywhere in Mexico. "
4699,Any good red foods you like?
4699,"In mexican food, many sauces and chiles are red, which are really tasty. Otherwise, I like strawberries. "
4699,"Sounds good, have any good stories from you walks?"
4699,Once I found an injured bird that I nursed back to health. That was pretty rewarding. 
4700,I moved to New York!
4700,"Were you living in the City of New York, New York City, or in a smaller town?"
4700,New York City
4700,how exciting ! what was it like in nyc ?
4700,Super busy but they have good food
4700,Have you ever visited any other cities?
4700,I've traveled a lot
4700,what place was your favorite ?
4700,I like Florida
4700,i love florida ! i hope to visit again soon . Have you gone to the beaches there?
4700,I haven't
4700,They are beautiful. We like to go at least once a year. Very peaceful.  
4701,"I enjoy the experience of being at a football game. The loundness, the fun, the people. Its just a great place to be around people. What do you like most?"
4701,You captured it. There is nothing like the feeling of being together with the people you know and love. 
4702,"Oh, I like mushrooms too."
4702,I don't like the taste of mushrooms.
4702,But you just said you  loved mushrooms. What do you like then?
4702,I like green plants.
4702,Broccoli?  Kale?
4702,Most all of the green vegetables I like.
4702,That's cool.  Me too.  They are really good for you to.  Are you into sports?
4702,I love watching certain Olympic sports.  Which one's do you like?
4702,Soccer is my favorite
4702,I occasionally watch a little NFL.
4702,What about the Olympics?  Do you like Summer of winter?
4702,"I love both, but more of my favorites are in Summer,"
4703,She cried. It took her a while to calm down
4703,I wonder if your sister ever thinks about that now?
4703,She still brings it up at family gatherings. It's a funny story now
4703,That is great to hear. You know Yoga calms the mind.
4703,I'm trying to master Yoga now. It is quite a journey
4703,"I bet yoga will be really good for you then because it's more than just exercise, it also has a meditative and spiritual core."
4703,After a stressful job I could really use meditation. Selling washer to the millennial generation is no easy feat
4703,What is the difference of the Millenial mindset I wonder?
4703,Not wanting to spend money
4703,Oh that means you have to know how to reach them. Do married Millenials spend more?
4703,Yes. It's a liitle easier but I don't run into many married ones
4703,This would be an interesting challenge to have in your line of work. Hoping you will be successful.
4703,Thanks. What do you do?
4704,im sorry to hear about your parents...Family is always so supportive  
4704,Most of the time they can be supportive.
4704,That's true some times its a few toxic ones 
4704,Anyone can be toxic either on their believes or the reasoning you are in their life.
4704,i try my best to be positive  i rather not bring negative to anyone 
4704,"Yes, Always be positive to everyone and support them in anyway you can."
4704,yes a little support can go a very long way. 
4704,"Exactly. Even if its something you don't understand, let them know you are there for them."
4704,i always say when i don't understand someone beliefs is just to show them love and educate myself on it 
4704,I couldn't have said it better myself. You can learn something you otherwise wouldn't have known.
4704,"exactly,,always good to learn things "
4704,Yes it is. Especially from other prospectives.
4704,yes even if it don't change your prospective you learned something from it 
4705,"No, not currently, but I really want to! I think they're very cute and that they have interesting personalities."
4705,they're pretty cool pets ! I have dogs and a cat too
4705,"Oh cute, what kind of dogs do you have?"
4705,one is a big boxer Labrador . the other is a little yorkshire terrier ! My labs color matches my blonde hair
4705,"Owner matching the dog huh? I love that haha. Lab boxer mix is one I've not seen, but I love larger dogs like those two!"
4705,He's a little intimidating with his size but he's the biggest baby. 
4705,So many people are scared of larger dogs which I never get. All of the big dogs I meet are just loveable fuzzballs.
4705,They're just too friendly sometimes. It's almost like they know they're called man's best friend. Even my bodybuilder mom gets scared though lo
4705,"Yeah, if they're not well trained they can get jumpy and over excited, which I can see being scary. The only dogs I've ever had come at me were pits."
4705,I used to have a couple pits and they were the sweetest just like my current big baby. Just depends on how they're raised
4705,"True. I've met a few nice ones, and then I've met some where the people must not have socialized them, or got them from bad breeders."
4705,"Like with any dog its how you train them, I've met Pomeranians who are meaner than some pit bulls"
4706,"that's amazing, that would be an amazing trip.  Have you even been to India?"
4706,"No I haven't. I've been to the Middle East and China, but never South Asia.  what about you?"
4706,Me neither.  However I do like Indian food :)  What did you like most about your Middle East/China travels?
4706,The different cultures are fascinating.  I hope to make it back some day. 
4706,I completely agree!! The Dominican Republic was my first country to visit outside of the U.S. and it was fascinating to see other cultures/atmospheres.
4706,I've always wanted to go to the DR.  what did you like about it?
4706,Mainly the beach :)  Went into town one afternoon to visit a few local shops.  Just interesting to see something different.
4706,I love beaches.  The ones in the panhandle of Florida are amazing.
4706,"Yes, which beaches have you visited?"
4706,"Destin, Navarre, Orange Beach and Panama City Beach.  Have you been to any in Florida?"
4706,"Mainly Panama City, was just there this summer with a few friends.  Something about the sand and waves are so relaxing!!!"
4706,My family used to rent a house in Panama City every year when I was a kid.  Fond memories for sure.
4707,What other things do you due for fun?
4707,I like to go hiking. It's very peaceful. What do you like to do?
4707,I like to shop but i'm out of money.
4707,I love to shop too! What types of shops do you like?
4707,I like clothing stores
4707,I always end up buying stuff for the kids then myself. That's where all my money goes to. 
4707,Yeah same for me
4707,that is nice ! i'd love more time for yoga and shopping
4707,Me too. I'm always busy with work.
4707,"I hear you! Life is SO busy, never enough hours in the day!"
4707,For real!
4707,right ! i need to find a money tree ! then i would be all set !
4708,That sounds fun!  How often do you larp?
4708,Usually once a month. How has your weekend been ?
4708,"Good, I'm definitely not ready to go back to work Monday.  We have a big client coming in and everything has to be perfect."
4708,"Yeah, that can be really stressful! I took this week off work. I've been missing my dad so I'm going to visit him."
4708,Where does your dad live?  I'm sure he will be glad to see you.
4708,He lives in Maine. I am from the west coast so it's a long flight. It's why I took all week off.
4708,I have always wanted to go to Maine.  I hear its beautiful in the spring.
4708,"It's wonderful in the spring! Winter, not so much. Unless you like snow....alot. Like REALLY like snow."
4708,"LOl, what does your dad do?"
4708,"He's a fisherman, has his own boat, or rather 3 of them. He's caught some crazy stuff out there! "
4708,"Wow, sounds exciting!  Did you go out fishing with him when you were younger?"
4708,"Yeah! All the time. It was fun, except when the sea was rough. Little me got freaked out by all the rocking."
4709,yes! but luckily I didn't break it. 
4709,I get injured all the time.  I work at a zoo and I'm all the time getting scratched or tripping.
4709,oh wow!  that sounds amazing though.  I start my new job soon at an elementary school where I grew up!
4709,"So, you're a new teacher!  I hear the first year can be difficult.  Are you looking forward to teaching?"
4709,I am but I'm nervous.  It's my first real job - just graduated at 22 last month!  How long have you been at the zoo?
4709,I've been there for years.  It's a great job.  The work is slow so they allow me to read when my chores are done.
4709,"what do you like to read?  I don't expect to have much down time at school to read, though "
4709,"I like crime novels mostly.  I just like to read.  You will probably get to read with your class, don't you think?"
4709,"yes I am teaching English but it's more Dr Seuss and such.  I love crime novels, too. "
4709,Who do you like?  I like James Patterson.  For the kids I highly recommend Newbery Award books.  They are good.
4709,Oh I'll look into those.  I love Patterson but didn't like his Middle School series so I stopped reading him. 
4709,"Interesting.  I still remember reading Green Eggs and Ham to my children.  We read every Dr. Seuss book there was.  It's a good profession, teaching."
4710,Cool.  Did she dance professionally?
4710,Yes she is an american Dancer. She also studied Yoga
4710,I've always wanted to try Yoga.  I worry that I would be bad at it.
4710,Yoga is low impact. They have classes for all ages and levels. It will be a reason to get up and help you stay healthy longer.
4710,Good points.  I really should try it.  Do you go to yoga classes yourself?
4710,Sometimes. I mainly do it online
4710,like you stream videos?
4710,Yes. They have lots of different videos for different ages and stages
4710,Cool.  Could you recommend one for a beginner?
4710,Yoga with Adrienne and Fitmaster Yoga
4710,Thanks!  I will check it out
4710,No problem. Its nice to do it in the comfort of your own home....especially once I retire. I won't have to leave if I don't want to
4711,"Well, I am using my marketing degree to open my own grocery store!"
4711,Oh that's great. Marketing is very lucrative!
4711,It can be! How are you?
4711,I'm great how are you doing?
4711,Just trying to decide if I should go all organic or add big box brands to my store. 
4711,That's a really hard decision.
4711,"Do you have any marketing or sales experience, by chance?"
4711,Not much but in school I have learned that marketing is mainly the study of management of relationships for business.
4711,It IS all about building relationships! Are you going to be finishing school soon?
4711,"Not for now, decided to finish up my PhD...it'll be tough but I think I can be done in 1 year or so!"
4712,The death of a sibling makes you look at your own life and when it is unexpected just hard.
4712,I'm sorry to hear about your sibling... I know it's hard but you have to keep your head up for them 
4712,Thank you so much for caring. I will be baking cakes for everyone later.
4712,Baking is a great way to clear your mind...you enjoy cooking
4712,Yes some simple things and I like to share the food.
4712,im not the best cook myself lol 
4712,Youtube has helped me to expand a lot. 
4712,youtube is such a great free teacher lol 
4712,I agree I have learned so many things that have helped friends and family.
4712,yes as soon as i cant figure something out im like let me look it up on youtube 
4712,Hey what have you learned lately?
4712,how to install my son car seat
4713,Do you have a trampoline?
4713,"No i don't, but wish i did when i was young."
4713,"Yeah, they're very fun. Have you ever been on one?"
4713,"Yes, my neighbors had one, so we would go over and jump. I was always cautious though, scared i would fall off"
4713,"I've fallen off one before, nothing too serious. Just a couple scratches & bruises."
4713,"I guess i always imagined the worst happening.  But anyway, it was still fun. Do you have any hobbies you enjoy?"
4713,"Yeah I love cars, graphic design & write music. You?"
4713,"I'm into baking and sewing. Especially during this holiday season. Other times, just being outdoors is fun."
4713,"I like baking too, I wouldn't say it's a hobby but it's really soothing & fun."
4713,"It is! I just made some scones this morning. So what kind of cars do you like. Modern, or older models?"
4713,"I like modern foreign cars. I drive a Civic, but the foreigns are out my budget lol. Would you say you could see yourself baking as a profession"
4714,I believe in the right to bare arms. So I need to go see whats happening.
4714,Just be careful and turn lights on so you don't shoot someone you know or an animal.
4714,Always. I'd want to more scare an intruder then actually having to use it.
4714,"I'm the same.  I have a firearm as well.  don't want to ever use it but if I have to protect my son and I, I will."
4714,And that is away it should be. It is all about protecting you & your family from possible threats.
4714,It sure it.  A good security system and cameras are very comforting as well.
4714,My husband wants to get those since I am usually home alone at night and we live out in the middle of no-where.
4714,I think that's a great idea.
4714,I believe so to-Just looking for a good deal on those.
4714,Get a couple of quotes.  Someone somewhere is always running a deal.
4714,Oh we are planning on just buying a system and us install them ourself.
4714,Nice to be so handy.  I couldn't do that at all.  I'd need someone to do it for me
4714,I am good with electronics haha
4715,It went as well as possible in my opinion!
4715,awesome - communication is key in any relationship
4715,That is very true. It was a long time coming. Glad to get it out of the way
4715,nice - do you do anything to relieve stress?  i need to run every night - i enjoy it and it helps clear my head. 
4715,exercising to clear your mind is killing two birds with one stone. very cool
4715,Yes! exactly! I tell my wife it's good for both of us!
4715,It sounds like you all have a healthy relationship?
4715,"Yes we have, mostly. She didn't like when I worked at the movie theater nights for 4 years so I quit"
4715,"I can see that. Wanting to have ""normal"" hours is what most couples enjoy. "
4715,I agree! where do you work?
4715,"I work for a marketing firm, nothing too exciting. "
4715,"Oh that's great, marketing is a fun career choice. "
4716,Yes. We were married for 7 years.
4716,"Wow, that's a long time.  Was the break up mutual?"
4716,"Yeah, we just realized we grew apart. So now I pour my energy into my work. I work at home on my computer in graphic design."
4716,I'm glad you both found the courage to face it head on but it's so hard after you have put that much time and effort into a relationship.
4716,It sure is. But you live you learn. Overall it grants wisdom. Are you in a relationship?
4716,"Yes, I have been married for 10 years.  We have 3 children."
4716,That sounds wonderful! I love kids. Someday I hope to have kids.
4716,Kids are wonderful but also a challenge.  I love being a mom though.
4716,"Yes, I know they can be a challenge! I'm a uncle to three. They love to pull my hair, which I don't love so much lol!"
4716,ha ! my family is almost all boys . we need to level it out .
4716,"Yes! My nieces say my hair is magic, whatever that means!"
4716,Ha!  Girls are so funny.  My boys just run non stop all day.
4717,I'm going to Italy. 
4717,Nice! I visited Spain not too long ago. I am positive you will have a blast.
4717,"Thanks.  I hope so too.  I have never been to Spain, but I would like to go sometime."
4717,I try yo travel when I can. My father used to sell insurane but he always taught me there is more to the world than just your hometown
4717,That's really great.  What is your favorite place that you've been?
4717,It would have to be either Spain or Jamacia
4717,Do you have any trips in the works?
4717,Yes Bali. next year
4717,Wow! I bet you'll have a great time.  What made you choose Bali?
4717,suggested by friends and relatively in expensive
4717,I'd love to hear how it goes.
4717,"I can't wait, everyone says it is the most magical place on Earth!"
4718,Have you ever experienced a courtship?
4718,I haven't! What movie are you seeing?
4718,"Lady on the Lake - Because this summer, I fell in love in my hometown, which is on a lake. :)"
4718,What is the movie about?
4718,It is about a lady who goes missing after falling in love during a summer vacation. Very eerie!
4718,I hope you two can enjoy it!
4718,"So far, so good - but I need to make sure my parents are here to supervise. :)"
4718,That will be fun
4718,Have you seen a good movie recently?
4718,No I haven't. But now I want to see.
4718,Like what?
4718,"i'm going to look for disney movie , maybe an old one ."
4719,I have heard of people getting scammed. Has that ever happened to you?
4719,I haven't. But I know a couple people lose to me that ended up loosing money in a similar venture.
4719,That's so unfortunate. I try to do as much research as possible. Have you ever used Yelp?
4719,A few times! I like to research concert venues on Yelp and go to the highest rated ones. How about you?
4719,I like to use them for restaurants. I just found a new burger place. What types of food do you like? 
4719,"Neat! Well, you can't be disappointed with pizza or wings! It is always goes great with watching football. Do you like watching sports?"
4719,Oh yes! Football is my favorite. Even though my teams doesn't always win. Have you been to a game?
4719,It's great! Yes I am a huge Steelers fan. I go to every game. How about you? Do you have a favorite team?
4719,I'm a huge Bears fan. Win or lose. I haven't gone to a game in a couple of years. 
4719,That is dedication! It can get expensive going to games every year. How long have you been a fan for?
4719,Probably since I was born. All my family are Bears fans. Have tickets gone up in price over the years?
4719,Neat! Yes they go up a little every other year. Have any favorite players?
4720,"Sports are alright, but I much prefer to be outside in my vegetable garden."
4720,i am always happy doing work in the garden . i tried sunflower seed sprouts in my garden.
4720,I've never grown sunflowers. Seems like a lot of work for little payoff.
4720,Just the sprouts for nutrition in 4 days is what I grow.
4720,Oh interesting! Kind of like micro-greens?
4720,Yes exactly. I desire to be as healthy as I can without spending a fortune.
4720,I've heard micro-greens are packed with nutrients. Do you recommend them?
4720,"I sure do, we are getting so many poisons when we purchase in the markets though."
4720,I tried growing my own vegetables this year. A little harder than I thought it would be. Bugs destroyed a lot of them.
4720,Oh I am so sorry to hear that. Please do not give up. Try again.
4720,I will for sure after the last frost of the season.
4720,Good. I f we do not pursue better health who will do it for us?
4721,Oh my goodness. I had no ideal. I have 3 cats myself but they are not Siamese. 
4721,"So you're the cat person, huh? I dislike animals personally. I am more into model building. That's my passion."
4721,"Interesting. Honestly, I didn't think I was a cat person but they have grown on me. I rescued them from a very bad man. "
4721,That's awesome. I have a dog I rescued so I realize how hard it may be.
4721,"It can be but I am grateful to have company. Anyway, what is your favorite color?"
4721,"I'm living in Manchester currently, so I should say purple, but grey is superior."
4721,Mine is orange. How is Manchester? I have never been.
4721,"Apart from weather - it is awesome, so much to see."
4721,Wow i have to go sometime. What do you do on your spare time?
4721,Reading and playing video games mainly. What about you?
4721,I like to cook and read. I love video games too. My favorite is Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty. 
4721,The Witcher 3 forever in my heart.
4722,"I try to live with no regrets because at that point, the actions I did was exactly what I wanted to do at that time."
4722,That makes sense.  You do what makes you happy and feel like your life is worth living.
4722,Exaclty. Sure I've made some bad choices but I don't regret them. They have lead me to where I am now.
4722,"That's a great attitude. I recent quit a great job to persue my desire to work in a lab, here's to no regrets."
4722,I've recently did the same. I left a job of 12 years to try to find a position less stressful.
4722,Nice. Best thing about my new job minus being my passion? I get to sleep in!!
4722,OMG YES!! I use to have to be at work at 4 am. Now its 10:15
4722,"Yea, no more 9 to 5 for me! What do you do for fun?"
4722,"I enjoy outdoors mainly, cars, gardening, movies. The basic  stuff. WBU?"
4722,Reading and video games for me. Enjoy a good move once in awhile too.
4722,I hardly turn my PS4 on. and Good movies are hard to come by.
4722,i can understand that . i'm that way with movies .
4722,I have a huge collection that aren't even open. I love black friday for that reason but I dont know why I buy them
4723,"I've never gotten pulled over for a DUI before, have you?"
4723,"Not to my recollection. LOL. But no really, I do not drink much so I have not been pulled over before. "
4723,I don't drink that much either because I have to take care of my dog
4723,"I love dogs. What kind do you have, or is it a mixed breed dog?"
4723,My dog is a boxer. Do you have any dogs?
4723,Oh all the Boxers that I have met have been so much fun! I have a mixed breed dog. 25 lbs of energy. 
4723,That's so cool! How long have you had your dog?
4723,3 years. She is really starting to calm down a bit now. How old is yours?
4723,Mine is 2 years old. I got him when my father moved to China so he could keep me company.
4723,"That is so sweet. I bet you miss your dad. Pets are such great companions, though. "
4723,Yeah my dog is very affectionate. Is your dog more independent?
4723,Haha. No. My dog will not let me leave the room without checking if I am okay. 
4724,Me too. I like to go where it colder to write. I actually prefer colder weather
4724,"I prefer warmer weather, but have gotten used to cold weather. I train horses, and much of that takes place when it's cold!"
4724,"When it's cold, you can dress in layers"
4724,A very good point! What else do you like to do in your spare time ?
4724,"Watch TV including Game of Thrones, travel, eat and play basketball"
4724,That sounds great! I think I'm the only one that hasn't seen Game of Thrones yet. I'd like to though!
4724,It's definitely and acquired taste
4724,Have you also read the books from George R. R. Martin or just seen the show?
4724,a little bit of reading. sometimes I become so engrossed I forget about work
4724,"Yes, I'm the same way with writing. I write mainly in my spare time. I have an unpublished novel that's almost done."
4724,Plans on publishing?
4724,"I think it will just be published online , an eBook at first."
4724,What do you write about?
4725,yeah it's kind of hard when you significant other doesn't have a job.
4725,It does make things a challenge for sure.  I like to read books to forget about daily problems like that.
4725,What kind of books are you into?
4725,I like reading books involving animals.  I recently read a great book about pandas.
4725,"That's amazing. I love animals, kangaroos to be exact. What was the book called?"
4725,"it was called Chu's day, it was very interesting and educational."
4725,"Very nice, where can I find this book?"
4725,It is available on Amazon.  It is available for Kindle but I read the paperback.
4725,"Unfortunately, I don't have a Kindle, but I'll definitely be looking for the paper back. "
4725,"I have a kindle, but still enjoy paper books.  Staring at a screen still seems odd to me lol"
4725,"To be fair, it's like staring at a phone, tablet or laptop. I wouldn't mind reading from one."
4725,"Yes it is very handy.  I always loved reading books on the beach, and paperbacks are great for that."
4725,Where can I find a Kindle? Book stores?
4725,You can download the Kindle app for your phone or tablet and read books on it.  It also works on a laptop.
4725,"Is it free? I love reading, we have tons of books in our apartment."
4726,I love a larger dependable automobile.
4726,I love my Civic - even though it doesn't necessarily reflect my personality. It's practical!
4726,Yes I hear you. Having a gas guzzler is not the best for work.
4726,"It is also great for the outdoors - I love rock climbing, and this car gets me everywhere I need to go. What do you have?"
4726,We collect Cadillacs and Lincolns.
4726,"Oh, cool!!!! I love old cars! How many do you have?"
4726,Three we just gave one to my grandson. Do you sing in your car when driving?
4726,"Absolutely! I always sing - in the car, the shower, everywhere! How old is your grandson?"
4726,You sound like me.. singing so much I am sometimes not aware. Grandson 20 is a singer too.
4726,He should try to find a job in Nashville - a great town for singers!
4726,Hey that is a great idea. I want to visit Nashville. Have you?
4726,"Yes - great town, though it can get a little crowded. If you love the outdoors, there is a lot to do there!"
4727,"Yes, that sounds like a good group.  Have you ever seen them perform in person?"
4727,"No, i havent, but wish i did."
4727,Are they still touring?  You might get a chance if so.
4727,I haven't checked recently to see if they are. Do you have a favorite band or musician?
4727,I love Maroon 5 and Matchbox 20.  What's your favorite song by the Stones?
4727,I'm one of those people who have a hard time narrowing down to a favorite. So i enjoyed several of them. Do you like football?
4727,"I like so many different ones, but those 2 are top of the list.  Yes, I like football. Do you?"
4727,"I do! i prefer to watch it live, but if it's on TV, I only watch big games like the Superbowl."
4727,I'm a big football fan.  It's always on my TV if it's a Sunday.
4727,Do you have a favorite team? Or any team as long as it's football.
4727,"My favorite is the New Orleans Saints, with the Seattle Seahawks a close second.  I do not watch or like college football though. Do you have a favorite?"
4727,"I watch Alabama games, but I also like the Greenbay Packers. "
4727, Roll Tide!  I've been a GB fan since Brett Favre.  I went to college with him.
4727,Nice! i became a fan when a friend's brother played with them. He's no longer with them but it was fun at the time.
4728,I watch my calorie intake too because I think I'm overweight
4728,It is so hard when there are so many delicious foods like cake and mashed potatoes. 
4728,I know! What's your favorite junk food?
4728,Tacos for sure. Any kind. How about you?
4728,I love french fries. But I have to remind myself to not eat them too often because I need to lose weight
4728,"I like them too. I am really partial to some fries, though. Like Arby's has the best fries."
4728,"I think McDonald's has the best fries, but Arby's is pretty good too"
4728,"McDonald's is definitely the most popular. I loved seasoned fries though. Do you like pizza, also?"
4728,I do love pizza. I love artisan pizza specifically
4728,"Oh yes, those rustic style pizzas are really good. They are usually cooked in a brick oven, correct?"
4728,Yeah! There's a pizza place right by my house that cooks pizzas like that. But I've been going to a salad place to cut down on calories
4728,Smart move. There are so many creative salad bars emerging lately. That is a positive trend in the fast food industry. 
4729,I agree. I trying to figure out who would do something that stupid. 
4729,My dad was a cop. I have some experience in such things. I can help you if you want.
4729,Great. What should I do? 
4729,Ask people around if anyone has seen anything suspicious?
4729,I already did that and everyone says they havent seen anything. 
4729,Try looking for clues in the area.
4729,"Ok I will check and see what I find. In the meantime, I am going to talk to the management company of the property to see about the cameras."
4729,"Great idea. And if it does not work, just call the police."
4729,I will. I do not like to get the police involved but I will do that in this case. 
4729,Why though? Police is there to help us.
4729,Sometimes. I just see too much going on in the news. ANyway do you have any hobbies?
4729,Reading and playing video games mostly. What about you?
4730,How is botox an escape?
4730,"It makes me feel younger looking than my family members, like my mean sister-in-law who doesn't like me."
4730,I define an escape as a break from reality. I'm still unsure how botox does that. I understand why you do it but still my point.
4730,"Yes, that's a valid perspective. I don't really need an escape because I have never had to work a day in my life."
4730,That must be nice. I've been working since I was 16.
4730,"If I had to, I would! Working since age 16 sounds like a LOT. Maybe this is why my sister-in-law doesn't like me, because I don't work?"
4730,I wouldn't if I didn't have to. But I like money and expenive things so set myself up to not have to depend on anyone.
4730,I never want to be dependent on anyone - ever! It would be like prison.
4730,"So if you don't work, How do you prevent that from happening?"
4730,"Fortunately, my great great great great grandmother left money that has supported all of us."
4730,Must be nice. I am self made. ;)
4730,"I actually envy you. Maybe I can try my hand at this working thing, and it will take my mind off my sister-in-law."
4731,Maybe it's the distractions in our house?
4731,It is just an expensive lesson. No failure is final I am sure you tried.
4731,"Yeah, I guess. We tried our best. Do you have kids of your own?"
4731, Three and 7 grandchildren. I can empathise when things do not go as you expected.
4731,"7 Grandchildren! I couldn't imagine. I can't wait until he has a child. Right now, we only have him & our pet dog "
4731,Every stage has challenges but we have enjoyed them all. The adult kids give back in many ways.
4731,What do you mean? If you don't mind sharing 
4731,"Our children have helped us start businesses, ministries and bless us financially. It makes us feel we did something right."
4731,What kind of business are you into?
4731,"we used to have Daycare Centers, Hair Salons and Bookstores. Now online businesses."
4731,"Nice, what do you sell on said websites?"
4731,"Life Coaching services and spiritual books as well as music we write, compose and sing."
4731,"That's great, what do you do as a career?"
4732,yes it is.  that's a long time. 
4732,It really strengthens the mind! It felt so refreshing reading beneath the trees in the sunshine.
4733,Are you doing anything to help preserve these animals?
4733,There are a couple conservation efforts that are being worked on at the moment.
4733,That's pretty cool. I want to contribute to jaguar preservation.
4733,That is great.  There is always a big need for donations.
4733,"Yeah, I've gotten more into researching jaguars because I drive one. I'm trying to offset my carbon footprint."
4733,That's funny.  What color?
4733,It's blue. What type of car do you drive?
4733,I have a black Audi.
4733,That's a nice car! I was deciding between an Audi and Jaguar when I was buying a car
4733,I have never driven a Jag.  Must be great if it won out!
4733,"The technology in a Jag is better than the tech in Audis, which is why I bought it."
4733,Interesting.  Which feature do you like the best?
4734,Thank you I will try that - I've only used the regular camera settings so far
4734,"Glad I could help, although I don't have a lot of experience either."
4734,I have been thinking of getting a DSLR - do you have any experience with those?
4734,"No, I don't.  I use my smartphone to take pictures, especially of my dogs and cats."
4734,"Oh - I love animals, especially dogs!  what kind of dog do you have?"
4734,I have 3 Australian Shepherds.  Do you have dogs too?
4734,I have a golden retriever - just one though.
4734,My last dog was a golden retriever/lab mix.  I adopted her as a senior dog.
4734,They are such great dogs!  And I know some about Australian Shepards too...they are such smart animals.  My friend has one and she's amazing
4734,I just failed at fostering a deaf and partially blind Aussie.  He's my boy now!
4734,That is a great way to fail!  Glad to hear that he has a forever home now.
4734,"Thank you!  I needed him as much as he needed me, I think."
4735,My dog is not interested in going either which is the real reason. 
4735,"I usually go hiking alone. I just like to see nature, see all the trees."
4735,Sounds like a good way to relieve stress as well. 
4735,"Oh, definitely. Though if you'"
4735,So I take it you like watching the leaves on trees change colors in the fall?
4735,Yeah. It's really inspiring. I'd like to try to paint or draw it sometime but I don't think I'd do it justice.
4735,Very hard to recreate for sure. I am terrible at painting and drawing. 
4735,I sometimes try to paint along with that Joy of Painting show but I'm not as good as I'd like.
4735,As long as you're having fun. What do you do for work?
4735,I'm in accounting. It's kind of intense sometimes so I look for fun ways to de-stress on weekends.
4735,I can totally understand what you are saying and relate one hundred percent. 
4735,"Hence the hiking and watching art shows. Bob Ross is super calming, ever watch him paint?"
4735,I have. The way he could paint and tell a story was always great.
4735,He's been a favorite of mine since I was a kid.
4736,I absolutely LOVE hiking and want to go to the Appalachian Trail!
4736,You should. I've been a few times and it's very impressive.
4736,I went with my parents when I was a little girl. We hiked for days!
4736,I would love to go someday. What do you do in your spare time?
4736,I love to do everything from yoga to binging a good TV series. How about you?
4736,I watch the Office on repeat! I've seen all the epiodes on Netflix. I also play guitar.
4736,"Oh, I love The Office! Are you a John Mayer fan? I love him!"
4736,"I'm not really a huge fan, but I love Maroon 5!"
4736,Yes! Are they still together? Those tattoos!
4736,I believe so. I'm pretty sure they released a single just recently
4736,He has a lot of energy - their lead singer. Is he still on The Voice?
4736,"No unfortunately, he left the show"
4737,I plan to get married someday too. Do you enjoy being married?
4737,Yes. My husband is very supportive of my carreer and takes care of the family. It is important to have an understanding relationship. 
4737,"Right, i think supporting each other is the key. One of my hobbies is playing video games, so i wonder how that would play out when married. We'll see. "
4737,"I love playing games. We play together as a family sometimes. However, it is nice being single and having that free time. "
4737,"Yes, the free time is nice for now. Glad you can all play as a family. So do you have any hobbies?"
4737,"I love listening to music, especially Taylor Swift. I also like to go to comedy clubs. How about you?"
4737,"Comedy sounds good! As for me, I love the outdoors. So i have a moped that I use to explore places around town. "
4737,That sounds like a blast. I love nature and mopeds have to be the coolest transportation method around
4737,"They're fun. I try to be careful and take all necessary safety measures though, since I have to share the road with cars."
4737,"Good call. I think helmets are essential. I watched an episode of Flight of the Conchords once and the main character made a ""hair-met"" Ha ha Good stuff. "
4737,"lol, i have never heard of Flight of the Conchords. What's it's about? "
4737,A couple of New Zealanders in New York that are in a band. Pretty silly stuff.
4738,My husband and I are going on a 3 day get away just 2 hours away so we do not spend a lot of travel time.
4738,"i think any time away is a plus, no matter how far or close.  "
4738,So true. We love to laugh. Have you ever been to a comedy show?
4738,Not recently.  What are you doing for the rest of the 2 weeks?
4738,Actually relaxing and 
4738,"I guess as long as you aren't at work, it's a good thing.  Have you ever been overseas?"
4738,Yes I was in Nairobi Kenya a couple years ago for two weeks. Loved it. Have you?
4738,I actually lived overseas for about 10 years.  Loved it.
4738,O my how interesting. What part of the world?
4738,"Europe, Middle East, and Asia...Netherlands, Oman, and China."
4738,I am familiar with all of these except Oman. Where is it?
4738,"It's on the southeastern tip of the Saudi peninsula.  South of Dubai, if you're familiar with that."
4739,Of course I did. They know I love the beach.
4739,I love swimming so the beach would've been great!
4739,Fine. Who needs them. We will make our own trip.
4739,Good for you.  You don't need to be around people like that.  You'd probably have more fun without them.
4739,I usually do. Give me a few drinks and I will have my own gathering. But I need to get ready for the academy. 
4739,What will you be studying at the academy?
4739,The police academy. I'm not sure what all that intels.
4739,Oh wow....that sounds amazing.  The only interest I seem to have is online shopping.  LOL
4739,Well I gotta have money for that which means a job.
4739,"Yes, that makes sense.  I'm excited for you."
4739,Thank You. I'm glad someone is. It's going to be alot of work
4739,"You will be great at it, I'm sure.  Are other friends not as excited?"
4740,Oh no - gaming woes!  I don't know much about linux.
4740,"You should try it, it's a lot of fun. Quake improved on Doom by offering full real-time #D rendering and even had early support for 3D acceleration."
4740,"I'm open minded, and will definitely try it, but I'm more into music than gaming.  Do you like listening to music?"
4740,"No, I don't listen to too much music. I watch TV. I like Supernatural."
4740,I love that genre.  Supernatural is on my list of shows to binge watch.
4741,It's the fact that I'm eating raw fish
4741,True that. I went to my fave sushi place last night and wore my red dress with red lipstick. 
4741,"Nice, you had a date I'm assuming?"
4741,Yes - and my convoluted point is that sushi is easy to eat on a date! I only order the veggie rolls. 
4741,"My brother loves sushi but I just can't wrap my head around it, no pun intended"
4741,That is funny! Do you like Indian food? 
4741,"Yeah I love it, tandoori, butter chicken, masala"
4741,"Yummy! Now, I am getting hungry. What are you having for dinner?"
4741,"I just had pasta salad, and you?"
4741,"I think I may have some Chex cereal. I feel best when I don't eat gluten, though I slip all the time."
4741,"Gotta try your best to keep your head on a swivel, lol"
4741,What does that mean? :) Head on a swivel? Good one! 
4741,Just means to stay focused lol
4742,"I prefer it crispy usually, but cooked is good as well. "
4742,"Yeah, it's all good. I like it on just about anything. Have you ever tried the donuts with bacon?"
4742,"No, I've never tried that before. Have you? What is it like? "
4742,"I have! It's sweet and salty and the one I had was caramel, so it was smoky and just delicious."
4742,That sounds great! I would love to try that sometime at our local diner. They have the best breakfast food!
4742,"Oh, I wish I could eat out more! "
4742,What is your favorite place to eat when you go out? 
4742,There's a local diner here where I live called HomeTown. They have the best onion rings. What's yours?
4742,"Onion rings are always a good choice. We have a lot of good restaurants here, but my favorite is called Stone-E Cabin Barbecue. "
4742,"Ohhhh, I love barbecue. I used to do the KCBS BBQ competitions!"
4742,"That's awesome, barbecue really is great! What types of dishes did you make for the competition? "
4743,"oh really? I didn't know that, I am going there next month."
4743,You are going to love it!  It's a place for happy people (I am a happy person myself!)
4744,Because I needed to protect myself.  Do you have a weapon of any kind?
4744,Not at the moment because I can't use it very well.
4744,I got lots of practice and took classes to make sure I knew what I was doing.  What about an alarm system?
4744,Yes. I have one installed but I think I will practice and take some lessons too.
4744,"With kids in my house, I needed to do it the right way.  When they get a little older, I'll do the same with them."
4744,That sounds like a good idea. I should keep that in mind for when I have my own children.
4744,Do you plan on having children soon?
4744,"No. Not right now, I don't feel ready, want to get more education."
4744,"That's smart.  Some people do it, as you know, but it does make things a little more difficult."
4744,Absolutely. And I would think it costs a lot to feed and clothe them. Does it cost a lot?
4744,"Yes, children are expensive.  The older they get, the more expensive they get."
4744,Especially if they intend to go to college? Education is expensive and hard work.
4745,"It was taken out of context, I was really hungry lol"
4745,"Then, I wouldn't feel bad about it. Are you a vegetarian? I am."
4745,"No, I eat both meat and veggies. What kind of food do you like?"
4745,"I love Italian, Indian, American - You name it. But I have to limit my carbs. What do you do for fun?"
4745,"I do lots of wood work, I love music & I'm a huge foodie. I'm a lumberjack full time though. You?"
4745,"Wow! You don't have to sit all day as a lumberjack. I am a writer, and when I have free time, I read books."
4745,Not really I have a huge axe which speeds up time for me. Do you have any published books?
4745,Working on it; thank you for asking! I would love to take an axe throwing class.
4745,"Axe throwing classes are super fun, I would suggest you go to one before you get old lol"
4745,"Is 50 old? :) I am like Benjamin Button, though. Are the axe classes scary?"
4745,No lol 50 is definitely not old. I'm talking 90s! They're not scary at all.
4745,Hahahahaha! I think I will sign up. Should I buy any protective materials?
4745,"No, they usually supply that for you. I gotta run, it was a nice chat."
4746,"Since I'm on the shorter end of the spectrum for men, I tend to act more macho than I need to sometimes."
4746,"I'm short, too, so I guess we have something in common.  But, height really doesn't matter to me.  "
4747,Apple pie what about you?
4747,I love apple pie also
4747,My grandma's are the best you have to try them!
4747,That would be great
4747,You should also try her cupcakes they're the best. She has all the time in the world whilst I work 10 hours a day trying to make ends meet
4747,That is awesome I wish I had more time to bake
4747,Same nowadays everyone is too busy with work we don't even have time to make a delicious meal
4747,Yeah it can be hard to find time to sit and eat with family
4747,"I don't even remember the last time I ate with someone although saying that, the precious free time that I do get I use just painting and time flies"
4747,Some times I find I eat while writing or playing video games.
4747,Yes I did once try to eat whilst painting which did not end well and let's just say that was the last time I brought food anywhere near my paintings
4747,Oh no did it not go well?
4747,No it ended with jam covering 95% of the canvas
4748,Have you ever been on a train?
4748,"Public Transportation, I have. But nothing like a transcontinental passenger train"
4748,I think it would be so awesome to take a train across multiple countries!
4748,"Agreed, that would be badass. Have you ever traveled anywhere by train?"
4748,I took a one day train from Ohio to Pittsburgh and back. It was fun.
4748,That sounds like a heck of a trip! How long was the ride?
4748,It was about 2 hours each way. And we got to stay in Pittsburgh and sightsee for about 6 hours.
4748,How neat! Did they give you the whole ride or did you have to switch off?
4748,We rode the same train all the way and back.
4748,Very nice! I always though railways are a very safe land transport system. Would you agree?
4748,Yes I would. I feel they are probably much safer than the roadways.
4748,I'm glad you agree! Where are you from?
4749,That's nice that you offer to take your mother shopping
4749,"Well, because I work from home, designing video games, I need family contact. :)"
4749,Designing video games sounds fascinating.  I know a bit about programming but not that much
4749,"Also, my Mom is my best friend, so that makes it easy. Do you have a favorite video game?"
4749,"Lately, I have been playing Zelda.  I usually like Mario Brothers type games"
4749,"Oh, I started with Donkey Kong! What did you do today?"
4749,I made coconut chutney and raita to go with leftovers.  What about you?
4749,"Oh, that sounds divine! Today, I worked, and now, I may make some chicken tikka. :)"
4749,Ooh that sounds wonderful.  I am having leftover chicken KOrma 
4749,You are after my heart! I LOVE CHICKEN KORMA. I am American!
4749,"This is my version - chicken in Instant Pot, Patek's korma sauce, shred chicken and simmer"
4749,Just copied that down. :) Thanks! Should I buy an Instant Pot? That sounds easy!
4750,"yes, he is.  It just came as a shock to all of us."
4750,Losing a job can be devastating. How is he handling it?
4750,He's depressed but he'll start looking again as soon as he can.  Have you ever been fired?
4750,"I'm glad he's taking it well. Yes. I got really depressed, but I found that getting outdoors was really helpful. "
4750,"That sounds like a good idea.  I'll mention that to my dad, see if it'll help him.  What do you do now?"
4750,I have been doing a lot of fitness. I was working out a lot to help myself feel better and I got a job at a gym. 
4750,Awesome.  Being around people with like interests is key.  I'm sure you're enjoying it.
4750,I do. What do you enjoy doing in your free time? Do you enjoy your work?
4750,"I love my work.  Not many people can say they love what they do, but i absolutely do. What kind of work do you do?"
4750,I work in fitness. You absolutely should love what you do. Have you ever had a job that you hated?
4750,"yes, i did.  Lasted the summer but then never went into that industry again."
4750,"Lesson learned, huh. I have had  some terrible jobs, too. What do you do in free time"
4751,"Wow, that's pretty interesting. What do you think of corn dogs? They're one of my favorite food items. "
4751,I rarely have them to be honest. I’ve only tried pogo sticks. Do you know them?
4751,"No, I've never tried those. What are they? "
4751,I’m pretty sure they are basically corn dogs but just froze. I bet they aren’t as good as fresh corn dogs
4751,"Ahh, if that's the case then I'm sure I've tried them. "
4751,Yeah. Do you have a favourite juke 
4751,"Juke as in music? I enjoy most genres, but my favorite would have to be pop/rock music. My favorite is All Time Low. "
4751,"Sorry the message sent before I could finish. I enjoy most music, especially the 80s. I know All Time Low, they’re pretty good"
4751,That's ok. I enjoy 80s music as well. What would you say your favorite 80s band is? 
4751,David Bowie is my all time favourite for sure. How about you?
4751,"I like a lot of them, but if I had to choose just one I would say Bon Jovi. They have so many great songs. "
4751,Bon Jovi is awesome! Great songs to sing a long too. Got a favourite song by them?
4751,"Definitely. I'd say my favorite is either Bad Medicine or Have a Nice Day, but they have so many great songs. What's your favorite David Bowie song?"
4752,Yes he has been its been very difficult for him. 
4752,"That is a hard thing to go through. If I could turn back time, I would never have accepted my last job."
4752,Why? How bad was it?
4752,"Well, my manager was very controlling, and I have a tough time with that - being controlled. How about you?"
4752,My husband was laid off. Its a tough time with Christmas being 3 weeks away. 
4752,Are you employed?
4752,Yes I am but I only work part time. I am essentially a stay at home mom.
4752,This sounds so hard for you. Does your husband have any good prospects? 
4752,Well he has two interviews next week so Im hoping for the best. Are you married?
4752,"No, I am single - almost married three times, though. I think my control issues run deep!"
4752,Wow. Do you plan to ever marry?
4752,"If I meet the right man, definitely. However, I am at an age where most of the men are carrying heavy baggage. It would help with the expenses, though."
4753,thats awesome live in KS with my family
4753,nice it is my freshman first year of college .
4753,How do you like the college life?  Is it very different from high school?
4753,its different for sure but the people are nice
4753,Are you married? Dating anyone?  I have a wife and kids.
4753,nope not married yet lol
4753,what field of psychology are you planning to work in when you graduate?
4753,I am most interested in forensic/criminal psychology
4753,"I like to scuba dive with my family, what are your hobbies?"
4753,I love photography and cooking
4753,I love cooking.
4753,We have that in common!  I spend half my weekends in the kitchen!
4754,It would be so cool to get to climb that mountain.  I need to put it on my bucket list.
4754,"It is a worthy bucket list item for sure!  Africa is worth it.  It is an inspiration, its history.  I like classical music too."
4754,There are many mountains I would like to climb but I think Mount Kilimanjaro is definitely in my top 3.  Classical music is very calming.  
4754,"That's great, you are going to love it and I hope you get there.  What else is on the bucket list?"
4754,Mount Everest is number one but so many people have trouble with that one.  What about your bucket list?
4754,"For now I'm good, off the bucket list.  Mountain climbing is worthwhile, but expensive, and after a summit need to recover."
4754,I am adventurous but its funny because I don’t like to drive.  It frustrates me so much.
4754,"Driving IS frustrating.  I walk a lot, allows for my mind to think.  It's important for art, planning, being creative."
4754,It’s impossible for me to be able to walk everywhere.  That must be nice.
4754,"It would be nice, I walk a lot but not everywhere.  But nowadays a lot of folks are on scooters, it's nuts!  I like to slow things down."
4754,I’ve never rode a scooter.  But I have seen multiple people flying down the road on them.  It’s funny to me.
4755,I love Starbucks and their barista's are very professional
4755,Yes most barista's are good.  I like to go for the ambiance 
4755,"Yes, the ambiance is amazing and you can get a lot of work done too"
4755,And not to forget the smell of coffee in the air.  there is just something about that that is so relaxing
4755,I love the scent of coffee too! 
4755,Did you say you worked as a barista?  I don't know if I have the stamina.  LOL  Starbucks is always busy
4755,"Yes, I have but it's very difficult keeping everyone's orders in tack."
4755,I couldn't imagine trying to remember all those orders.  Are the tips good?
4755,"The tips are really good at certain times of the day, it really depends though."
4755,I bet you get really good tips during the holiday season
4755,"Especially the holidays! It seems everyone is in the season of giving, Lol."
4755,LOL so very true or the pumpkin spice latte makes them loopy
4756,Dogs are the best pets!
4756,Yes they are mine loves to share Asian food with me
4756,Who doesn't love asian food?
4756,I know right!  He loves to be with me no matter what I am doing
4756,What kind of dog do you have?
4756,I have a boxer.  His name is Kotton
4756,"That's nice, mine's named Rocky. We have a talent show coming up"
4756,That is cool what are you and Rocky going to do?  I had a boxer named Rocky years ago
4756,You must really love boxers. We 
4756,Yes I do and have had several.  Kotton is still a puppy and has been very sick. It is tough
4756,Aww hopefully Kotton has a safe recovery. Rocky & I will showing off his tricks at the talent show
4756,What tricks does he do?
4756,"He can roll over, speak, sit, give high 5s & play dead"
4756,That is great!  Nice chat!  Hope to get you again!  Good luck and good night!
4756,"Thanks, you too!"
4757,I love ice cream and can't resist it.
4757,"It is a dangerous dessert.  Dangerous to the waist line, especially mine."
4757,That is so true! But just think of all those delicious flavors! I can't resist ice cream!
4757,What is your favorite flavor?
4757,"I love vanilla with real vanilla beans, that is my favorite! What is yours?"
4757,"That is actually one of my favorites, too.  I also like Snickerdoodle from Marble Slab Creamery."
4757,"Snickerdoodle has peanuts, right? I'm not fonf of peanuts, but love other nuts!"
4757,"Well, it has Snickers in it, so yes, it does.  I'm not a fan of chocolate ice cream at all."
4757,Me neither! But just thinking and talking about ice cream is making me put on weight! I have to try harder to resist!
4757,Same here.  I may have to make an ice cream run after dinner.
4757,After all those donuts you ate? LOL!
4757,I need to keep my sugar coma going!
4758,I’d would say I’m tech savvy but it’s so hard to keep up with all the new tech
4758,You're right - it is hard to keep up with new technology.  It changes constantly!
4758,"Yeah! Have you got a preference on your tech? PC, apple? Desktop or tablet?"
4758,"Well, at work, I have a PC but at home I have a MacBook pro."
4758,Similar to me. Are you a gamer at all?
4758,No - I don't do any gaming
4758,Not even on your phone?
4758,"well, I have some games on my phone but I don't know if they qualify for games to real gamers"
4758,Depends on who you talk to I guess. I probably play too much games. 
4758,I'm sure my games are lame to someone who is really into gaming
4758,"Haha, hard to compare I’m sure. What do you do on your free time?"
4758,"I do a lot of cooking on my spare time, and freelance as much a possible.  I'm a scientist in RL"
4759,"I am slowing figuring that out, but being overweight is tough on my self-esteem.  I want to look like I did before.  With hard work, I hope to."
4759,I totally understand. Every person I know who has lost weight talks about how difficult it can be.
4759,"It's process, I know.  If only it just processed a bit more quickly. :)  We live in such an immediate-gratification society, I guess."
4759,"Yes, you are right. Especially with pop culture the way it is today. My guilty pleasure is watching The Voice while I work out."
4759,"Awesome! Who is your favorite judge?  And, do you have any workout tips to share?"
4759,"Gwen Stefani is my favorite. I'm listening to Bach right now, but this conversation makes me want to change the song to one of hers."
4759,I like her as well. She has a great voice and is a very stylish person. I also like Blake Shelton.
4759,"Yes, he seems like such a likable person. I think its cute that they are together now."
4759,"Agreed, they seem like an unlikely couple at first, but somehow it just makes sense.  Both are incredibly talented.  "
4759,I was shocked to learn that she is 50. I want to know her secrets!
4759,"No kidding! I'm sure she works out a lot, and it shows.  She's kind of a role model that way."
4759,"I agree, she is one to admire. I wonder if she has a health plan that someone could follow."
4759,Thank you for the chat!  It was quite enjoyable.
4759,You're welcome. Have a nice night!
4760,Really? That's fascinating! 
4760,"I love pizza, I could eat it everyday, how about you?"
4760,Definitely! I don't think I could ever get tired of pizza. What's your favorite type of pizza? 
4760,"I like the veggie the best, what do you like best?"
4760,"I love three meat. Pepperoni, sausage, and bacon. Can't beat that! Supreme is good too though!"
4760,"NY style pizza is the best, so is Chicago pizza. My dog gets excited when I bring home pizza.  Do you have pets?"
4760,"NY style is so good. I have one cat, but I am hoping to get a dog soon. What breed of dog do you have? "
4760,I have a small Terrier named Emmy and a cat named Felix.  What breeds do you like?
4760,"That's great. I like Beagles, Yorkies, Labs, and German Shepherds. I would love a Borkie (Beagle/Yorkie) or a German Shepherd one day!"
4760,They are all good breeds.  I don't think I could be without a pet.  Do you have any hobbies?
4760,"I enjoy watching movies and playing video games in my spare time, what about you? "
4760,"I like to read, crochet, travel, and also eating pizza."
4761,The parrot was talking too much and the chihuahua barked at him!
4761,That's funny! What was the parrot talking about? Did it sound like a person?
4761,Standard Polly want a cracker - the dog did NOT want a cracker!
4761,That is certainly understandable. Do you have any pets? My dog is always a source of entertainment like that
4761,Pets are important and I'd go crazy without.  Glad you have a dog!  1 dog three cats.
4761,"Wow, that's a lot of pets. Do they all get along with each other. My dog is definitely a loner pet and is best with only people."
4761,Every animal definitely has a different personality.  The dog is a guardian and friend and peace maker. The cats generally yes
4761,"My dog also acts as a protector when I am out on walks with him. I would love to own a cat one day, but I'm allergic to them"
4761,I hear you.  It's hard to like cats while being allergic to them!
4761,I seem to have an affinity with them though. Whenever I go over to a friend's house they get all over me.
4761,"They can be great companions.  Whatever I read, the bible or any book, they are there!"
4761,That sounds great. I like to sit down next to my dog whenever I am reading or doing homework.
4761,You have a great dog that likes books!
4762,I really like Clearwater!
4762,"Me as well, I read my favorite novels at the beach."
4762,What kind of novels do you prefer?  I find it hard to read at the beach with the bright light
4762,"Mystery novels, what about you?"
4762,More biographies or true crime
4762,oooh nice! I find those interisting as well.
4762,I wish I had more time to read sometimes I have to go with pod casts or audio books
4762,Podcasting has been around since the 1980s so there are lots to choose from.
4762,Yes sometimes I will even put it on YouTube if I am traveling and have good signal
4762,"Wow! you are a vlogger as well, cool!"
4762,Actually I prefer to watch vloggers more because I am not that interesting haha
4762,"Understood,we all have our hobbies!"
4763,No. My goal is to plead guilty for the ticket and pay court cost.
4763,You know you can get it deferred so that it won't go on your record
4763,"Oh really! Thanks, I did not know that."
4763,Yes! can request deferred adjudication to prevent your mark on your record and your insurance to increase
4763,"That's great information, I'm green about this being my first ticket and court date."
4763,"Oh I bet.  I remember my first ticket, I cried so hard the cop didn't know what to do."
4763,"I know the feeling, it's devastating and not to mention embarrassing."
4763,I was so afraid of going to jail.  LOL.
4763,"Yes. My worst fear to be locked up with real criminals, I couldn't even imagine, Lol."
4763,I would be hiding under a bench in the fetal position all night.  Best just not to get another ticket
4763,I will drive the speed limit even if I have to be latel.
4763,For sure.  Where were you going when you got stopped?
4764,My husband's best friend is getting married (for the third time) and we are in the wedding
4764,The Bahamas is beautiful. I am sure you will love it. First time there?
4764,My husband and I were there about five years ago.  We loved it.  Can't wait to go back.
4764,I’m jealous. It will nice to get away from the chilly weather and see the sun again 
4764,"Yes!  Have you been there before?  If so, when was the last time?"
4764,I was there briefly while on a cruise a few years back. I wish I could have been there longer and seen the place more
4764,I've never been on a cruise!  I've seen videos of weather tossing the ships around.  Did you experience any bad weather>
4764,"Thankfully no, the cruise was super smooth. It’s one of my favourite vacations. I really want to go on one again soon"
4764,I'd love to try one.  Maybe we will have to do that one of these next vacations.
4764,Yeah! You into travelling?
4764,"I absolutely love to travel, but don't get to do it as much as I'd like to"
4764,"I know, I feel the same way! What is your favorite destination? I'm going to Kazakhstan in 2.5 weeks and i can't wait!!"
4765,how are you?
4765,"I'm doing good, but up late tonight because my neighbors are being a bit loud. How are you doing?"
4765,doing good.. im up late doing school work.. sorry to hear about your neighbors
4765,It's ok. What are you going to school for? 
4765,im getting a degree in management.. hopefully it's worth it.. what do you do for a living?
4765,"I work in IT, specifically retail IT. Management is a very good field to get into. I'm sure you'll do great. "
4765,IT is a great field.. you should always have work
4765,"Definitely, that is right. Do you have a family? "
4765,i sure do.. i am blessed with three healthy children and a beautiful wife
4765,"You are very blessed. I have 4 wonderful children and a very supportive husband. I'm glad to hear your family is happy and healthy, that's great! "
4765,Yes it is.. i'm happy to hear that for you
4765,Thank you!
4766,They are really reliable.
4766,"I loved my Honda Civic, and I loved its blue color."
4767,I got her from the dog pound and she had been abandoned on the street.
4767,"Aww, that is so sad to hear. I'm glad that she has a good home now, though!"
4767,I felt like I needed a friend at this time in my life so it has worked out good for both of us.
4767,I'm glad you managed to find each other. What happened to her baby?
4767,"As soon as she weans the baby, I am giving the baby to a family with two kids who want a dog."
4767,"Oh, that sounds perfect! I'm glad you're able to do that for them."
4767,"Since I don't have a promising future myself, I have already lined up a good home for my dog.  "
4767,I'm sorry to hear that. Why don't you think you have a promising future?
4767,I've been diagnosed with severe heart failure that is not treatable.
4767,Oh no! I'm so sorry you're having to deal with that.
4767,The bright side is that it has given me a new perspective toward life so I'm doing things I would not have done otherwise.
4767,That's so good to hear. I'm glad you're making the most of the time you have.
4768,"Yes they do, I really enjoy listening when I visit the orchestra."
4768,"Do you go to the orchestra often?  I've never been, but I would love to sometime."
4768,I tend to go several times a year. I like to take my wife during valentine's day.
4768,"That sounds lovely.  I teach music, so it would be a real treat to see a performance live."
4768,"You should definitely put it on your bucket list sometime. I teach concert piano, what a coincidence."
4768,"Yes, that is a coincidence.  It's definitely a small world.  Do you have any hobbies other than music?"
4768,I also enjoy swimming and fishing. I love being out on the water. I guess music and water goes hand in hand with relaxation at least for me.
4768,"Ah, we differ there.  I am deathly afraid of the water.  Being in the garden, on land, is more relaxing for me. :)"
4768,What do you like to do for hobbies other than music and gardening?
4768,"I like to cook and bake.  This time of year is perfect for apples, pumpkins, and pears.  I make a mean pear sauce."
4768,Ah sounds tasty. I love fall as well. My family and I like to take in the pumpkin patch and apple picking as well.
4768,"There is another coincidence.  We love those activities, also.  They are a great way to spend a weekend."
4769,Just okay? What could be better? What is bringing you down?
4769,I am more tired than anything.  Weekend went by way too quickly
4769,I can agree with that. Not really tired but don't want Monday to come.
4769,Same.  Its like groundhog week just waiting for it to all begin again
4769,Eh. The week will probably fly by.
4769,"Always does, so what type of work do you do?"
4769,I work in a bank. Wbu
4769,Healthcare... for a large insurance company. These chats are strange but good part time income
4769,I just started doing this stuff for extra income. Today is the first time I actually did anything and still learning.
4769,Are you doing this as a Turker also?  It is a strange task but interesting
4769,Yes I am. The chats seem to pay more with less experiance.
4769,Yeah same here just trying to get past the 10 days to see if it goes up
4769,I have been signed up for over a month just haven't done any work.
4769,It doesn't seem they get approved quickly
4769,"I guess we will see haha because I have no idea,"
4769,Right!  One rejection so far and about 2$ LOL
4769,I have no rejections with $10
4769,I am still trying to learn about the catchers and finders.  Seems most available are .01 
4769,I have no idea. These chats pay almost $2
4769,That will be nice!  Guess I better get on to the next then LOL
4769,Yeah Time is money. Later!
4770,Only horror movies. I prefer to watch DIY stuff on Youtube most of the time.
4770,awesome ! i love doing diy stuff like that .
4770,What type of DIY stuff do you do? I love sewing.
4770,I like to sew all sorts of things like pillows and blankets with stitches and a needle and thread.
4770,I like sewing sweaters and clothing mostly. When did you get into sewing?
4770,"When I was around 8 years old. My grandmother sewed, that's what got me interested."
4770,My grandmother got me interested in sewing too! I wish I could find a sewing club or something
4770,Sounds like a fun club though to join. My school didn't have anything like that. Maybe you could find something local
4771,oh I would like to get a tattoo.  Did it hurt?
4771,Yes - it hurts but it was worth it
4771,"Not sure what get a tattoo of, was thinking of maybe a heart behind my ear"
4771,That's nice.  I love all tattoos.  Just be careful of tattoos above the shoulders...
4771,Why? Do they hurt more? Or because they are harder to hide
4771,"They are harder to hide, and depending on what you do for a living, it still carries a really negative stigma.  Especially so close to the face"
4771,Oh I see what you mean.  My nieces boyfriend has them on his face and she won't bring him around her work friends
4771,"People are so judgmental it's sickening.  And something about having them anywhere near the face makes the ""judgy"" people worse"
4771,Oh yeah I agree.  But I admit I sometimes can be judgy but I am learning you can't judge a book by its cover
4771,That is true.  You can't.  People's character comes from within.  
4771,I know.  I met my nieces boyfriend and at first his tattoos were intimidating but as I got to know him I really liked him
4771,That's great that you were willing to look past his exterior to get to know his true nature
4772,Thanks! we are so happy! she has been very sick!
4772,Hope everything goes well. I know people always get nervous when seeing doctors 
4772,How has your week been? I have just been hanging around the hospital
4772,Busy. A dentist’s work is never done. Enjoying the hospital food?
4772,Oh NO! thankfully my daughter has been so helpful and brought up meals
4772,Lucky you. How much longer are you there for?
4772,They are talking about letter her go home on Tuesday! I mess my red pj's!
4772,Wow! Always better to be 100 % sure I guess. Do you live far away?
4772,We are from out of state! Only the best Dr's! how far are you from sd?
4772,So you travelled far. I bet your family is looking forward to going home then. No place like home
4772,That is so true! Plus my wife's pizza is amazing!! i dieing for her pizza!
4772,Can never go wrong with pizza 
4773,i love tacos.. i just ate at my favorite taco place tonight
4773,I love Tacos!  I have a favorite local place to eat them. 
4773,i think i could eat tacos every night.. i might be addicted
4773,Me too!  They are a great do to food. Easy to make!
4773,yes indeed.. can't go wrong with taco night whether at home or at a restaurant
4773,Taco tuesday's are there for a reason!  What kind of music do you like?
4773,i like classic rock and some alt rock.. what do you like?
4773,Folk Metal music is my favorite!
4773,interesting.. i'm not really sure what that even is :)
4773,its a mix of folk and heavy metal music.  Imagine heavy metal played on banjo's
4773,sounds like a kick-ass mashup :)
4773,It is pretty cool.  You should hear what AC/DC sounds like!
4774,Hurricanes aren't that bad.
4774,"I do love the beach, just not sure if I could live there and risk it."
4774,"Some hurricanes have been bad, but the trick is not to live directly on the beach. Even just a few miles away is safer."
4774,Definitely. How far inland would you say is safe while still being close to the beach? 
4774,"Personally, I'd think 5 miles, maybe a little less would be fine. Much depends on where the hurricane makes landfall and how big its winds are."
4774,"Very true. My family and I have set up a hurricane/emergency kit just to be safe. While we have never had to use it, it never hurts to be ready!"
4774,"Oh, yes, the hurricane preparedness kits. We go through it every year. Dorian had everyone running scared. That was a record breaking storm"
4774,"Yeah, Dorian was pretty intense. I live close enough that we were getting nervous, but luckily it missed us. Makes you wonder what could happen in the coming years."
4774,"Yes, I was glued to the TV for that one too. We were projected to take a direct hit during the runs of some models. Luckily it turned."
4774,"That is crazy, but we go very lucky. I'm glad everything ended up okay for you and your family. "
4774,Same for you. That storm was no joke.
4774,What is the worst hurricane you have ever experienced? Andrew was bad but I was too young to remember it and thankfully not in its path. 
4774,"I went through: Charley, Frances, Jeanne, and Irma. Charley and Irma were the two worst. There were a couple others over the years as well"
4775,He should have just placed the blame where it goes.
4775,It has been so long since I have been in school I don't know that they even care these days
4775,Its been about 12 years for me so I got you. probably the least of their worries.
4775,Pulled my kid out as a sophmore and home schooled her because it is so bad where we live
4775,"Yeah, I don't blame you there. Only bad thing about home schooling is lach of socializing but they were old enough they should have some friends."
4775,"Perk was she was able to start working full time, sit a semester, then starts college in Jan. "
4775,Yeah that is a huge perk. gets her a little head in life.
4775,Yeah but it hit hard with her motivation to grow up
4775,GROWING UP IS A TRAP lol
4775,Sure is..
4775,Nothing we can do about it. Just live life the best we can.
4775,Yeah just sit back and watch. How long you been Turking?
4775,My first day actually
4775,Good luck I am just about a week in and still broke
4775,Haha I don't expect much. Maybe a little extra is all. Good money doesn't come easy.
4776,I have one sister and two brothers
4776,Oh I have one sister and had 2 brothers but one passed away.
4776,I'm sorry to hear that.  That is very sad
4776,It was hard.  You learn to live without but your love and memories never end.
4776,I cannot even imagine.  My condolences...
4776,OH thank you.  Are you close to your siblings
4776,Yes - we all live within 5 miles of each other
4776,That's nice.  My brother lives closer to my mom about 20 miles away.  But my sister lives a mile away.
4776,I hope you get to visit with her often
4776,I do go twice a month.  It's not so bad now that the new toll road has opened.  Cuts the time in half.
4776,That's good.  I love to hear that families take the time to visit one another.  
4776,Family is important.  So sad when I hear of families fighting
4777,You know a lot about sports. Enthusiasts?
4777,I know a little.  I'm a soccer goalie.
4777,Good to hear. Competitive or just for fun?
4777,"It is for fun, but very competitive in my league."
4777,Love a good competition. Been playing for long?
4777,All my life.  I'm in an adult league that plays at night.
4777,That’s awesome! I’m more a hockey player myself 
4777,That's cool.  What position do you play?
4777,Goalie too actually. 
4777,"Wow!  Lots in common between the two sports.  No cleats in Hockey!  I wear nike cleats, does nike make skates?"
4777,Not sure tbh.  My wife usually does the shopping lol
4777,Mine too!  
4778,I did throw up. I can't handle that smell.
4778,How did stop the nausea or vomiting?
4778,I had to walk away so I have no idea
4778,wow that must have been tough
4778,It was fine after I left the room
4778,thats good
4778,The student was just nervous and couldn't get over the fact of being in front of alot of people
4778,i was the same way in school. i hated talking in front of the class.
4778,I still am. I hate talking to a huge group of people
4778,yeah me too its a good thing i dont need to do it much now that im older.
4778,I don't either really. lol I'm so glad
4778,so do you like sports? i love basketball
4779,It's hard being a step child
4779,"It can be, I'm sure. But if you have a nice step dad it's not so bad."
4779,That's true but everyone isn't so lucky
4779,I know. My grandmother had a step mother who was very mean to her.
4779,"I know of and have heard horrible stories of evil step parents, some even go to the depths of daily torturing their step children."
4779,"So sad. My step dad is a runner, and he and I often run together."
4779,That's amazing and great for bonding. I love to run also.
4779,They say it is good for the mind to run.
4779,"It's for sure satisfying, especially if it's goal oriented."
4779,"Yes, it's good to have a goal. Mine is to run at least 4 times a week."
4779,"Wow, that's an amazing goal and I hope you'll reach it."
4779,"I try to, but sometimes life just gets in the way."
4780,"Yeah, she's usually pretty quick to respond, so the delay has me a little concerned."
4780,She will be fine.
4780,Is your mom close by where you live? Mine is far away.
4781,"Wow! I didnt know that, I thought it was new too."
4781,"Like everything else in New York, it is a fast moving sport that requires quick thinking."
4781,"Thats why I like it. I was lucky and joined a team last year with some really experienced players, learned alot. You played it long?"
4781,I've just played a couple times.  I have watched others in Central Park a few times.
4781,I prefer to play over watching. 
4781,I don't have much free time since I moved to the city.  It has been a cultural shock moving from the South to NYC.
4781,I suppose it would be. It would be like me moving from Canada to the South. How do you like the winters?
4781,"I enjoy walking around to all the shops even when it is cold, but it is definitely different fromFlorida weather.am trying to adjust to the cold weather, but "
4781,I try to make the best of every season. Spring is by far the best.
4781,Fall is my favorite.  I like the crisp cool days and the pretty color of the leaves. 
4781,"And the clothes, I can finally break out my boot collection again. "
4781,I had to buy some new clothes because Florida winters are not much colder than NY summers.
4782,"Sometimes there is a good reason, but I work long hours so it's frustrating having your time wasted."
4782,Yes it is so we will get our six and get rolling on haha
4782,Yes indeed!  Love rolling in the big truck!
4782,Do you use any other work at home sites other than Turks?
4782,"Not yet, but have been looking around for more.  Plan on using Robinhood to invest Turks money."
4782,"I use Survey Moola, up to $10 today compared to Turks at change"
4782,I will check that one out thanks!  Still hoping to get these conversation Hits accepted lol
4782,First time trying them. Not sure why so many are available. Makes me nervous ha
4782,"Yes, I've done a bunch today.  Kind of seems to good to be true lol.  Definitely better work than roofing though."
4782,"I could use a new roof, not on this pay though."
4782,Yes they are expensive.  It is hard work with not much pay.  Barely covers the gas in my truck lol
4782,I am sure.  Which state are you located?  One with many storms and insurance work?
4782,Yes in Texas
4783,Country music is great. I like to listen to country music while i'm driving. 
4783,It's the best and they are so good. It is country music!
4783,Have you ever gone to a country music concert? I've seen kellie pickler.
4783,"I have never been, but I would like to see Lady Antebellum."
4783,They are amazing. I love their music. 
4783,"Do you like Brooks and Dunn? I think they are great, I can listen them all day."
4783,Yes I do! My favorite song has to be Neon Moon. What is your favorite country song? 
4783,"my favorite is My Maria, my mother used to play me that one."
4783,Do you sing or play any musical instrument?
4783,"I play the guitare, but I am terrible singer. What about you?"
4783,I'm a terrible singer. I only sing in my car when no one is around. 
4783,"My dad tought me to play the guitar, there is no so many guitar teachers in rural Wisconsin where I came from."
4784,My whole family is into swimming.
4784,Me too.  We did summer swim league with the kids.   We put a lot of miles on my blue honda civic going to practice. 
4784,As a whole family. Thats awesome. Still into it?
4784,No. All the kids are grown up. I just got hired part time at McDonald's to help pay for it all!
4784,It’s a great exercise and pastime. 
4784,"Yes,, and it is a great life skill!"
4784,"Yeah, everyone should learn to swim"
4784,Some schools around here are making it mandatory.
4784,Same here. Love to hear that!
4784,It should be mandatory for everyone. The trouble is finding places for kids to swim in cities
4784,I imagine that would be hard. I guess my area is pretty lucky
4784,ME too.  We have lots of outdoor pools where I live.
4785,Oh yeah but it wasn't that difficult at all for her.
4785,That's great. Sounds like she has a bright future ahead of her.
4785,Hopefully she makes enough money for me. I'd like to move some place warmer. It's too cold where we live.
4785,What a sweet daughter to take care of her mother!
4785,Yep. Not sure where she got the intelligence from though lol. I like watching reality TV shows. 
4785,"Ha!  It sounds like her trajectory is set, and she is going to do great things!"
4785,I don't doubt it at all. How are your kids doing?
4785,"They're doing great!  One in Army, two in college, one in High School"
4785,Wow that's a lot of kids. Two were enough for me lol. Glad that they're doing well though. 
4785,Thank you!  The oldest is getting out of the Army in 5 months! Can't wait!  
4785,Yeah it can be stressful.
4785,"Yeah - it's been long 4 years, and times are crazy these days.  Can't come soon enough."
4786,"Thank you, it was sad. I'm just glad that it didn't suffer for long. I hate to see animals suffering. "
4786,i dont want them to suffer either. But is your friend okay now? he will be lonely now.
4786,"Yes, he is doing ok now. He was quite upset for a few week, but he has pulled through with time. "
4786,"Good to know that, at least he feels better day by day."
4786,"Yes, that is good. Have you ever had any pets? "
4786,"I have no pet currently, but I do love animals."
4786,Animals are great. Dogs are my favorite. 
4786,Do you have dogs? 
4786,"Yes, I have one dog. A German Shepherd named Axel. "
4786,That's a cute name! Have you been traveling with him?
4786,"Yes, we have went to a few different states so far. He loves road trips! "
4787,I've never heard of him.  Do you have any other recommendations?  Maybe something that 's a quick read; grad school keeps me pretty busy.
4787,Depends on what you consider a quick read. Some people consider a 400 page book to be quick.
4787,"Sorry about that.  That's the ""scholar"" in me being too wordy. :)"
4787,That sounded like a ton of puns. It's okay. I like books that take me about a week to read. Patricia Cornwell makes good crime/suspense.
4787,I will look into her.  A week's worth of reading sounds about right.  Do you have any other hobbies besides reading?
4787,I like playing video games and caring for my cat.
4787,I love cats!  Tell me about him/her.  I actually have two kittens I just adopted.
4787,I've had her since she was a kitten. Shes a black cat named Munchkin.
4787,That's awesome.  Mine are 8-week old siblings that were orphaned: a calico named Sissy and a black and white boy named Foo.
4787,So cute. I got her from a friend's neighbor. She talks all the time.
4787,She sounds like she is wonderful company!  Cats are so much fun.
4787,"They are. We recently lost our dog, so she was a little upset after that."
4787,"Oh, I am sorry to hear that.  Losing a pet is hard; my thoughts are with you.  Thank you for the lovely chat. "
4787,Thank you as well.
4788,I applaud anyone who's willing to work through pain. I also do it on a daily basis and without excuses.
4788,I often go to work when I'm not feeling well. Much of it is about work ethic.
4789,What is your favorite curry? Mine is chicken korma.
4789,thats cool mine is the same i love chicken korma
4789,Do you ever make it? I do sometimes.
4789,yeah ive tried but it never turns out good. im not really that good at cooking.
4789,I love to serve mine with garlic naan bread. I'm getting hungry!
4789,yeah me too. there is this really good Indian place near me thats amazing. do you have many indian places near you? 
4789,"Not too many, but when I visit the UK I have plenty to choose from."
4789,ive never been there. ive always wanted to go though. the uk and Australia sound like good places to me. 
4789,Australia would be great to visit! I would enjoy exploring the outback!
4789,yeah i would like to see some of the wildlife
4789,"The only thing is that so many of their snakes are poisonous, so you have to be careful."
4789,yeah ive heard alot of things there are really dangerous. it still seems like a cool place though.
4790,That happened to me too! I’ll just try again next year I guess
4790,I am sorry.  We will get it next year.
4790,"Yeah, sometimes it’s not about our skills."
4790,Yeah sometimes it is about not giving up
4790,"Exactly. But hey, we were good enough to audition right? It’s also personal taste too"
4790,Yeah they don't know how great we are ha
4790,Just what I was thinking. Are you still going to watch the season?
4790,Yes I will still support it
4790,Me too. But I’m still going to be salty that I’m not on it
4790,Yes low key salty for sure.  Next year we will prevail
4790,Cheers! To the underdogs 
4790,Next year they may be the underdogs
4791,Midnight Blue attracts attention without being a over bearing of attention
4791,Yes! And it goes really well with an olive right now.
4791,I'm not a fan of olives honestly
4791,Me neither - but in terms of color?  Its hot right now.  Watch when you walk through the mall next time.
4791,Isn't that a green though? I wouldn't imagine blue and green going together much
4791,Yes - I know what you mean; but its a thing!  
4791,Eh I'm not a huge fan of green on clothing. lol on me anyway
4791,I agree actually - I have a couple of pieces accidentally though.  Suddenly they have come out of the back rack in the closet haha
4791,"I hardly wear anything out side work clothes and when I'm not, I just have a few things I usually wear."
4791,I go through phases to be honest. I dunno; its not even about wanting to stand out really. Expression?
4791,I don't really even like standing out. I just like wearing what I feel attractive in.
4792,Well I love chickens and my date took me to KFC and I wouldn't eat it.
4792,That is awkward. I guess you should have gone to Pizza Hut.
4792,I would have preferred that. I was born in Kansas and the Pizza Hut there was my favorite restaurant. 
4792,I love pizza hut!  I'm from the south!
4792,That's cool. Do you have a southern accent? 
4792,Not anymore.  I was in the Army for a long time and it changed over time. My best friend is still in the army
4792,Thank you for your service then. I have family members who were in the armed services and it's very admirable. 
4792,No need to say thanks it was a privilege! 
4792,What are you doing now since you are no longer in the Army?
4792,I am retired and enjoy playing piano everyday.
4792,Wonderful! I wish I could play an instrument. What is your favorite tune on the piano?
4792,I like Billy Joel a lot!  Piano Man is my favorite!!
4793,Sounds cool. I don't know much about art but it seems like he's my favorite artist.
4793,yes he is a great artist ! How about you? whose artist do you love?
4793,I like van gogh and Morrisey. He's vegetarian though while I am vegan.
4793,I like them too! do you like to paint?
4793,"Eh, sort of. I prefer programming more though. "
4793,"wow, you are so smart then."
4793,Oh boy I wish. Took me a while to learn how to do it. 
4793,How long it takes to mastered it?
4793,"Well, it took me 4 years of college studying computer science, but I started messing around with code when I was in 7th grade. "
4793,"OK, it is a very long time, I thought it was like 4 months learning from the internet. kidding!"
4793,"Hahaha. Well you can do some basic stuff in 4 months, but if you wanna get paid a lot, it requires some study, no offense."
4793,I wish I could turn back time and take programming course then
4794,"Risk, we used to have games that lasted all weekend."
4794,"Oh, I remember that one! We don't play enough of those games nowadays."
4794,There is a version of Risk based on Star Wars that is fun.  We played it a lot this summer to avoid the heat.
4794,"Oh, too funny! I used to love playing a game called Snakes and Ladders. Do you know it?"
4794,"Yes I remember playing that when I was a kid, very fun game."
4794,Up the ladders and down the snakes! Another one was Ludo.
4794,"I've never heard of Ludo, or I don't remember it if I have.  We also played a game called Mouse Trap."
4794,"I have not heard of Mouse Trap, but I did play a very fun game called Beetle."
4794,I've never heard of Beetle either.  It sounds like I have some games I need to look into lol.
4794,Me too. We probably need to put aside the electronic devices for a while. LOL!
4794,Yes that is always a good idea to spend some time away from the electronics.  It's hard to do these days.
4794,I know. I feel sorry for today's kids who don't play the old fashioned games.
4795,Yes. It is really fun
4795,How long would you say you've been playing? 
4795,Maybe 2 years in total
4795,That's cool. How often do you play? I play about once a week at least. 
4795,Just about every other week. What other games do you like to play?
4795,"I like a lot of games. Mario Party, Call of Duty, Firewatch, Life is Strange, anything with a good story and replayability is appealing to me. You? "
4795,I like Mario party and Call of duty mostly
4795,"I love Call of Duty.  Modern Warfare is a great series, probably my favorite of all. "
4795,Yes mine too. Call of Duty almost have me locked in. it feel so real
4795,"So true. I was never a big fan of the futuristic titles like Advanced Warfare or Black Ops III. I prefer the realistic ones, they're great games. "
4795,Yeah  it feels so real and I love playing with others too
4795,Me too. The multiplayer is great. We should play together some time. 
4796,I can't decide if I want to fess up or not
4796,I can't imagine how hard it is to decide.  What were you thinking?
4796,I feel really bad so I think I may tell the teacher tomorrow.
4796,I wonder what kind of punishment they will give you
4796,I'm hoping if I came clean they'll just give me a zero on the test.
4796,Maybe if you explain they will give you a retake.  Explain how important the grade is
4796,I hope so.  I can't afford to fail this test.
4796,I would just explain how much pressure you were under and that you didn't make a good decision
4796,I'll try that.  Thanks for the advice.
4796,No problem!
4796,How have you been doing?
4796,I am tired and dreading Monday!
4797,Usuaully not. You never know if its true or a scammer
4797,"You're so right. As a law enforcement officer, I see people scamming more than most."
4797,"Exaclty, If I dont cash to throw around without it affecting me"
4797,"I'm trying to teach my daughters to be kind, but also use common sense. You have kids?"
4797,"I can understand that. No, I don't and don't want any honestly."
4797,"I didn't set out to have four kids originally, but I wouldn't trade them for the world!"
4797,Yes I understand that. Things happen haha
4797,LOL! What do you do? Work or school?
4797,I work full time lol
4797,"So do I. Sometimes I wish I could just take a year off and travel, though."
4797,Same. That's why I'm doing this to try to pay some debt off.
4797,"I hear you! It's hard not to get into debt, these days. "
4797,Oh I know!
4798,I do as well.  They were my best subjects in school.  I also like computers.
4798,I went as far as Calculus I in college. That math was pretty hard. What is the highest math you've taken?
4798,"I had honors algebra as an undergrad, and in grad school I had statistics.  Stats was challenging but fun."
4798,I did stats in college. It was conveniently disguised under the name of Research and Evaluation II
4798,"Even though I like math and science, I teach history now.  I had to have stats for my masters in curriculum and instruction."
4798,Ah. I enjoyed Algebra much more than stats. I was happy though because I did learn stats by doing the coursework.
4798,"Do you use a lot of math in your job now?  It's weird how it can pop up unexpectedly sometime, even in mine."
4798,"I use it some. I find I use it more in my personal life than my work life. Yes, it does pop up unexpectedly."
4798,"In short, I don't like having a cell phone."
4798,"Even though smartphones fulfill most people's needs for a telephone, digital camera and video camera, maybe a smartphone isn't for you.  I do love mine though!"
4798,I know most people do.  I guess I'm rather a hermit who prefers not getting calls and texts. :)
4798,Some days I hate mine too. Too connected.
4799,what about food? do they serve pastries or anything like that?
4799,"The food is amazing at a barista shop! They sell many croissants, cookies, and much more!"
4799,That's awesome! What's your favourite food at a barista shop?
4799,"My favourite food at a barista shop is a croissant. I only work as a barista during the week, I design jewelry on the weekends, you should come see!"
4799,"I'd love to, but I can't this weekend, I'm going hiking with a couple friends!"
4799,"Oh that sounds like fun! Maybe next weekend you can come see my jewelry. I make earrings, and many bracelets."
4799,That's so cool! Is it a business you are starting yourself?
4799,"Yes, I am starting my own jewelry business. It's hard starting off alone, but I'm sure I'll be fine."
4799,"Yeah, I'm sure you'll do great. What is your business called?"
4799,My business is called Pearls' R Us. Do you work?
4799,I don't work right now. I just graduated college and I've saved up to travel for a year before I work
4799,Oh that's great! Where do you want to travel?
4800,To the mountains near Reno.
4800,Where is it?
4800,A small town in California named Bridgeport.  It was so expensive in LA that I once lived in a storage locker for 2 months to save money.
4800,I am sorry to hear that. But at least you survived
4800,"It was challenging, but I saved a ton of money!"
4800,and how was it in your new place?
4800,"Very nice, lots of space and land.  The great outdoors!"
4800,it's awesome when you live in a small town and can really enjoy the outdoors. Do you love outdoor activity too?
4800,Yes.  We mostly hike and do some camping.  Lots of exercise in the mountains!
4800,I love it too! even It is so calming just to feel the fresh air
4800,There is nothing like Mountain Air.  My wife and I make pottery and sell it in town. 
4800,"Oh, tell me more about your business"
4800,Very small.  We work out of shed out back.  We make about 30 pieces per month. 
4800,Oh that is nice. Do you have a website for your business?
4801,It's good to put aside all our tasks and to enjoy family time now and again.
4801,So true. Family time is a crucial part of life. I look forward to it each day after work. 
4801,Me too! My little boy Owen is so much fun to come home to.
4801,I can imagine. How old is your son? 
4801,He is just three years old - a wonderful age. He wants to know about everything he sees.
4801,That's adorable. Enjoy every minute you have with him. They grow up so fast! 
4801,Do you have children? Are they grown?
4801,"Not yet, but I hope to some day. I would love to have a son of my own. "
4801,Children are such a blessing. I hope that someday you will have a son too.
4801,Thank you! They really are a blessing. 
4801,They do grow fast though. I can hardly believe that Owen is three already. He'll soon be in college. LOL!
4801,"Oh yes, never too early to start a college fund haha!"
4802,My 
4802,"Really? Who in your family, what are they like?"
4802,My car has been giving me trouble for awhile and so they bought me a brand new car!!
4802,haha well that's a pleasant surprise...what kind of car
4802,They got me a Toyota Camry.
4802,Those are great cars!
4802,"Yes, I'm so excited!  It gets great gas mileage and they even got me a top of the line one."
4802,"Oh, even better!"
4802,"It has leather seats, a sun roof and a navigation system.  They said I needed one since i'm always getting lost.  lol"
4802,LOL! Navigation system is great. My car has Apple Car Play in it. I can't live without that.
4802,That sounds awesome!  What is your favorite station?
4802,I don't listen to radio stations much these days. Not with Pandora available.
4803,This too happened to me five  years  ago
4803,It's a bad situation but the good thing about it is the you were not in the vehicle
4803,Yes this time around and we are very fortunate
4803,Let me ask you was the vehicle totaled
4803,Yes. Completely totaled
4803,sorry to hear that . it must have been so hard
4803,"Very hard and sometime depressing, not having a car."
4803,Well at least you are physically capable of getting another vehicle it might take time
4803,"Yeah, that is what I continue to concentrate on"
4803,Yes stay positive
4803,Thank you. Positivity is key
4803,That hope and optimism will take you far in life.
4804,"Yes,my girlfriend isn't happy about it. "
4804,That's understandable she get mad. do you think there's a chance for you to get back together ?
4804,No way. I have a bad habit of liking everything I see on social media and I like something she posted. 
4804,Do you ever worry that social media has you too connected with information about your friends and community?
4804,"Yes.  I live in Austin, TX and everyone seems to know everything about my business. "
4804,But it's a good thing right?
4804,"Some information is good, but too much information isn't.  There needs to be a happy medium. "
4804,"I agree, back to your problem. do you think there's a chance for you to get back together ?"
4804,No. She broke up with me and I moved on.  I'm really happy with my new girlfriend!
4804,That's great to hear! glad you already have a new one.
4804,Yeah. Now if I just don't mess it up again.  I'm going to take a break from social media.
4804,its a good idea. social media is so toxic
4805,"yeah, working with a cold is the worst!"
4805,It's especially bad when it's cold and raining.
4805,What do you do to get over a cold fast? Hot showers and tea work great for me
4805,"Hot showers, the sauna, rest, and my wife's flu medicine."
4805,"I think i've found a cure for colds too, what's in the flu remedie?"
4805,"Rum, a number of spices, and apple juice."
4805,Sounds very similar to the cold cure! it's also great for warming up the shower singing vocals
4805,"Yes, it's also good for colds.  I'll have to admit I never thought of using it for singing in the shower."
4805,"Be sure to give it a try, you will be the star of the show lol"
4805,I guess if you drink enough the rum will certainly make you feel that way.
4805,Yes I'm sure between the rum and bathroom acoustics we would all feel top notch
4805,"Well if it doesn't cure the cold or flu, you sure feel better about it for a while. "
4806,"I just had a lot of files to go over,  forgot about my midterm and ultimately failed it"
4806,Oh man. Hopefully your work for the rest of the semester can make up for it.
4806,"I really hope so.. I don't have much free time anymore. Anyway, how is everything with you?"
4806,"Free time is hard to come by. Everything with me is good. Back to work tomorrow unfortunately, LOL!"
4806,Mondays are the worst. What do you like about your job?
4806,"Yes, I hate Mondays. The best part of my job is I work from home."
4806,"oh, i am so jealous! I have to drive 2 hours to my work and i hate it"
4806,Two hours? Yeah... I wouldn't drive two hours to work. Too long for me.
4806,"It is! But it is my internship Hopefully, it will bring me somewhere in the future. What kind of work do you do from home?"
4806,Gotta do the internship to get a good job. I write processes and manage projects.
4806,Sounds like fun! Especially when it is from the comfort of your own home (or bed :))
4806,I get ready each day just like I'm going to an office. It is important not to work in PJs :)
4807,That's a shame. It's sad that they make it such a difficult process. 
4807,"I know, it's frustrating. I am the daughter of immigrants so I have seen how difficult the process is first hand."
4807,I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope to see a day were immigration is easier. Our country was built on immigration! 
4807,I agree! maybe one day when my daughters are mothers it will be different.
4807,Hopefully. How old are your daughters? 
4807,10 and 13 . amazing they grow up so quickly . one already thinks herself an adult .
4807,"They really do! I imagine that's tricky, they probably already want to try to do their own thing. "
4807,"Yeah, especially since they are really close in age I can totally picture them going out every weekend when they are older. Do you have kids?"
4807,"I don't have any kids at this time, but I hope to have kids some day. They can be a handful but are also such a blessing. "
4807,Yes! You will make an amazing parent one day. Until then enjoy your life because everything changed once you have kids.
4807,Thank you for your kind words! Definitely just enjoying myself for the time being lol. 
4807,Excellent!  Those thoughts are beautiful.  Have a good day :)
4808,"Yea, I've been really distracted lately, so it didn't surprise me."
4808,Well it happens to everyone at least once probably. What has been going on with your wife anyways? 
4808,She's been sick and just had surgery. I've been doing my best to take care of her and everything else around the house.
4808,Hate to hear that. If you need anything please let me know and I'll do my best to help.
4808,I just stay pretty busy with the house and with taking care of our four dogs too.
4808,"How is my favorite dog of yours, Yellow? "
4808,"they are all doing good, just getting kind of old, so they need a little extra TLC. Anytime you want to come walk them, feel free!!"
4808,"That would be great! They all love me and it would help you out too, right? "
4808,"Yep, the kids have been staying with their aunt since their mom has been sick, so it would definitely help!"
4808,Any time good or certain time be better so I don't interrupt her resting?
4808,I
4808,I'm free after 4 on weekdays just let me know. 
4808,"thanks man, anytime would be great!"
4809,"Yes, still studying.  What are you studying?"
4809,I am study 
4809,What subject?  
4809,"My passion, music"
4810,"No, just want to have fun and YOLO"
4810,YOLO?  What's that?
4810,"You only live once, it's a quote to do crazy thing or whatever you want."
4810,Got it!  Taking it easy today.  My Dad is a preacher so we go to church on Sunday's
4810,So what? I even dont care if I dropped out from school.
4810,Did you go to school?  Don't drop out it is important!!!
4810,I don't care about formal education actually. nowadays you could get money from everything
4810,"I guess, just do something you'll regret. "
4810,no I wont regret it.
4810,"YOLO, Right?"
4810,"yeah cool, you got the point"
4810,"You have to do what makes you happy, not me or anyone else. "
4811,"Oh, for sure! If I could change my job, I would become a figure skater"
4811,If I could quite my job I would become a professional cyclist. 
4811,What do you do for work now? Are you cycling in your free time?
4811,I work at a bank. I am cycling as a hobby every weekend. Have you ever cycled before?
4812,"LOL! Five wives?  I don't smoke, and don't like second hand smoke because I always end up with a bad asthma attack when I'm around it."
4812,"I know; it's a bad habit.  Maybe I smoke because I'm so unlucky with women, who knows.  It might be best just to swear both off. LOL."
4812,"It is a bad habit, and one that is very hard to break I have heard!"
4812,"Yes, but not impossible.  Maybe someday I will kick it."
4812,Nothing is impossible if you set your mind to it. Quitting would be good for your health too.
4812,"Agreed. I need to find another habit, one that is healthy.  Do you have any healthy hobbies?"
4812,Mainly I just like to walk on the beach. It's good exercise and helps to clear the head after a hard day at the factory.
4812,It sounds lovely.  If only there was a beach here.  That would make getting out and exercising so much easier.
4812,"It does help when the scenery is beautiful, I have to admit. But you can walk anywhere - even around the shoing mall!"
4812,This is true.  I guess it's just too easy to make excuses.  
4812,I'm good at making excuses too. I guess we all are. I should walk more often.
4812,Perhaps this conversation will serve to inspire me to exercise more.  And perhaps be more healthy overall.  Thank you.
4813,Would you consider yourself tech savvy?
4813,"If it's a home computer I'm ok with it, but anything more fancy is probably out of my realm of knowledge."
4813,I'm somewhat similar myself. Are you good with smartphones and apps?
4813,"Yeah, I use my smartphone on a daily basis so I would consider myself pretty good with them."
4813,That's good! Are you into sports at all?
4813,"I love college sports, but really am not a fan of professional. What about you?"
4813,"I'm actually the exact opposite. I'm a big fan of professional sports, but I don't follow college sports that closely"
4813,I try to spend most of my free time writing instead of watching sports.
4813,"If you don't mind me asking, what types of topics do you usually write about?"
4813,adventure stories mostly. i like to really engage my readers with an exciting story!
4814,"I'll have to admit, she didn't get it from me."
4814,"well, your spouse is quite smart!"
4814,"Yes, she is.   I'm glad my daughter takes after her."
4814,hopefully my kids will take after my husband. 
4814,Well good luck to you.  I work well with my hands but I haven't seen my daughter take much interest in manual labor yet. 
4814,"we will see if they decide to go into the medical career like me, or something else. "
4814,I guess time will tell.  Have they reached college age yet?
4814,no they are young. but we are thinking about having another in the next year or so 
4814,Well good luck to you.  How many children do you have?
4814,"just one right now , 18 month old daughter"
4814,"Okay, your just getting started, we have three children, two boys and a girl."
4814,oh awesome ! well you guys are all set ! are you thinking about more?
4814,"No, that will do."
4815,Both? I just don’t know what to expect
4815,"To get more acquainted and get rid of nervousness, i would recommend you to watch Nandini, an Indian supernatural television drama. That would help to a certain degree"
4815,I do television. Is it scary?
4815,"Not really,! Its not like its scary ,but more light a child hood phobia. .Lol!"
4815,Lol maybe I’ll give it a try. Is it dubbed?
4815,Yes it is based of the original which was 
4815,Nice! D 
4816,"I like to grow basil, tomatoes, and cucumbers."
4816,I love fresh tomatoes right off the vine.  Do you?
4816,"Yes those are my favorite, so juicy !"
4816,I like cherry tomatoes most.  Sliced fresh tomatoes on sandwiches are awesome.
4816,"I love tomato sandwiches, Just add a little salt, pepper, and basil. It's so amazing. Have you tried that?"
4816,"Yes, delicious.  Do you have any belts in Karate?"
4816,"I quit after I received my brown belt, I wish I didn't. Do you ?"
4816,"No, I never stuck with it.  Brown belt is pretty advanced isn't it?"
4816,"Yes the next belt would of been black. Gets no higher than that, just different degrees of black."
4816,That's great!  Why didn't you finish for the black belt?
4816,I stopped to become a Pre-K teacher 
4816,"Oh, that's a good career choice.  I bet you enjoy it.  I know I would.  Little kids are so adorable."
4817,same then! I love to watch about forensic files and it makes me afraid to do everything.
4817,I love crime shows! 
4817,what shows in spesific?
4817,Real life crimes shows like 48 hours are my favorite. 
4817,I see but I havent watch it
4817,It is worth checking out.  I don't spend much time indoors as I like to hike.
4817,I love hike too! which mountain is your fav?
4817,The blue ridge in Virginia. 
4817,Its beautiful
4817,They are the best for hiking and camping. 
4817,you should try rinjani in indonesia then.
4817,Never heard of them. Sounds interesting and challenging!
4818,"Casino going bankrupt? Wow, you hardly hear of that. That must have been the place to win!"
4818,I owned several casino's back in the day but that one going bankrupt convinced me to sell all the otherd
4818,"Oh, so you OWNED casinos, I see. Did you like it?"
4818,I used to own them haha. Yes I was making so much money and then that one in Oklahoma went bankrupt.
4818,Must have had a lot of machines paying out money for it to go bankrupt.
4818,"It must've, even back then in the 1970s without all the inflation. It was opened on October 1, 1971. I also had some employees embezzle money from me. "
4818,"Ah, so it probably was the employees and not the machines that caused you to lose the money. "
4818,It may have been both. I just had bad luck that year. What do you do?
4818,I'm in the military and I travel a lot for it.
4818,oh how exciting! I wish I could travel more. What branch of the military?
4818,Air Force. I've traveled to several countries.
4818,Where do you live? My brother was in the Air Force. The USAF is the largest air force in the world - imagine that!
4818,My son was also in the USAF. In FL now.
4819,"Yes, but this time I do not think that I was dreaming."
4819,Did you feel like you were not really asleep? Like you were semi awake?
4819,"Exactly.  I drank some warm milk, hoping that it would put me to sleep but all it did was make my stomach gurgle."
4819,"Well, mine does that sometimes too when I drink too much Sprite. It kind of makes me bloated and then gurgly."
4819,I am sorry to hear that.  Have you tried drinking Kombucha?  It has probiotics which are good for your intestinal flora.
4819,I haven't tried that but I might because I drink too much soda. No one has ever recommended that to me!
4819,The other thing that you might try to calm your stomach is granulated or crystallized ginger.  It also calms your stomach.
4819,Will it help my being so bloated? My stomach feels so bubbly.
4819,"Yes, it will.  I was very sick with a stomach ailment and crystallized ginger cleared it right up."
4819,I hope you get to feeling better and I will try the Kombucha and see if it helps
4819,"Great! I also eat organic products whenever possible. My favorite color is orange and there is a lot of organic food that is orange: carrots, squash, oranges, tomatoes, etc."
